title: "E3 2007 Coverage"
description: "E3 changed a <i>lot</i> this year, from the name right down to the severely pared-down invite list.  The announcements were slim, save <i>Wii Fit</i>.  We tried our hands at a <a href=\"http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=421\">liveblog</a> for the first time this year, and filed numerous impressions and reports right from the show (which you can find in <a href=\"http://www.n-sider.com/content.php?by=all&date=07-2007\">July's news</a>) in addition to our customary deeper previews."
