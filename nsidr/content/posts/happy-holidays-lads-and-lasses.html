Dear reader,<br>
<br>
It's getting to be about that time of year.  All of us have something to do or somewhere to go, whether it's in front of the TV or down the street, or thousands of miles away.  Bein's how we're just a few people who run this site, it's probably best for us to take a little break while we all do our thing.<br>
<br>

So, startin' now we on vacation.  Check back after the New Year for another year of articles, some more crude jokes about kissing fresh babies, plenty of Mouth-On impressions of chalky inedible garbage, angry, disheveled rants about points of minor consequence, and maybe even some big surprises.  Enjoy your Nintendo tapes everyone, and may the season leave you in only the most minor mental disarray.<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
