Probably all of you have played <em>Kirby's Adventure</em> for your Nintendo-brand Entertainment System, which means you've seen the cute introduction that plays the moment you power it on!  First you draw a circle, then you dot the eyes.  Add a great big smile, and presto, it's Kirby! Or, for our Japanese readers, まるかいて　おまめがふたつ　おむすびひとつ　あっというまに.  (Draw a circle, two beans, and a rice ball.  Just like that!)  Yes, Kirby's Adventure makes it easy for anyone to draw Kirby.<br>

But did you know that this forbidden knowledge was actually known to the public a full year before the release of Kirby's Adventure?!  Yes, the secret was originally let out of the bag in the first television commercial for the game's predecessor, <em>Kirby's Dream Land</em>.  What's harder to say is if the song was written for the commercial then added to Adventure, or if the song was originally written for the game but then made into a commercial because they couldn't originally use it in the game.  At any rate, it's certainly weird seeing it in all its copied-from-an-old-video-tape glory...<br>

I particularly enjoy the transcendent section where the kid twitches mindlessly after having been blasted into outer space to collide with a star.  For the record, my childhood notebooks are filled with attempts at drawing Kirby that all look massively better than this kid's.  I was following the same goddamned directions as he was!  I wonder what he is doing now.  Probably not getting inhaled by weird pink blob creatures, but this is Japan after all.<br>
<br>
As a special bonus for my loyal readers, I also give you these two <em>Super Mario 64 DS</em> title screen drawings of Mario and Yoshi that my stepbrother drew, they are the most horrifying things I have ever seen in my life.  Remember kids, only draw Nintendo characters under the guidance of authorized directions.<br>
