I guess there's a new <em>Pikmin</em> game coming out this Christmas for this new Wii, and <em>Nintendo Land</em> and some other stuff.  It's gonna have the tablet controller, and some new firmware, and it's gonna have HD!  But man, I just cannot muster up even the tiniest squirt of enthusiasm when it comes to talking or thinking about it, whatsoever.  Not even a single drop of my liquids eke out for it, nary a vapor.<br>
<br>

What could possibly be the reason for my complete lack of gusto regarding this fancy new device?  The original Wii had me whipped into a frenzy by July, as I was getting ready to move to Pittsburgh for grad school and had already made plans to camp out and ensure I got one at launch.  You know, so I could play the Wii version of the new GameCube game.<br>

Part of it could be that I both am enjoying the 3DS and its games at the moment, and I also remember how desolate it was to own one at launch.  It's hard to remember it now, but can you believe we went months without even being able to download games from the eShop?  I think I was stuck playing <em>Super Street Fighter IV</em> for just about as long.  Then there were some ports.  Months, at least, until the system finally came into view when <em>Mario Kart</em> came out.<br>
<br>
And it's not a stretch to assume that even if Nintendo has their shit together now that the launch of the Wii U is gonna be any different from the 3DS, or even the original Wii.  Remember waiting and waiting for the News Channel, the other basic applications?  Remember Check Mii Out, and then months worth of no updates?  No, the first few months of the Wii U are going to be no dainty little walk in the park, especially once I've finished Pikmin and have only the prospect of another, not-on-my-3DS <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em> that has nothing to do with coins, the approach that I as a long-time Mario player am now convinced is the future.<br>
<br>
Unlike most people, I can't put the blame on the hardware's power, on the release timing, not really on the slate of future games since I know there will be those, not exactly on it not feeling brand new.  It's a pervasiveness that is notable to me only in that it reminds me of the absence of concern, of any thoughts whatsoever.  Even writing this pushes my brain to its limit, tests me to see what exactly I have to say about this Wii U.<br>
<br>
I can't say that it's good or bad that I feel so average, but there it is, a beige alert, an if I don't survive, tell my wife hello.  The hype train has pulled into the station but it doesn't leave for a long long time.  And though I could Hop Aboard, grab a nice seat for the journey, it feels nice out here, in the air.  All of my liquids retained.
