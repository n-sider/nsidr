Living in Japan has its drawbacks.  In the age of total region-lock, I'm forced to turn to costly American 3DS cartridge imports, overpay on shipping, and wait forever for my games to arrive.  I'm stuck paying exorbitant Japanese prices for PS3 games, the oh-so-beautiful Ghibli Blu-rays, and pizza (also the pizza has mayonnaise on it).  And I also live in a little box the size of a deck of playing cards.<br>

But there are benefits too!  One of them is I can eat sushi all the time, just completely stuff my head with it.  The second and final benefit is that I get a lot of StreetPass tags!  That means that whenever a new StreetPass puzzle comes out, I usually have it finished up within a week or so.  Imagine my delight when Nintendo recently released their new Kirby's 20th Anniversary puzzle in the Mii Plaza!   I always love looking at the little dioramas once they're finished, though for the most part they're never anything that amazing&#8212;usually just a slightly animated version of the puzzle picture itself, but in THREE DIMENSIONS.  That's why I was so pleased with the new Kirby puzzle, which I just finished today.  It's totally great and awesomecool!  I think it is the best of all the puzzles so far.  In fact, I was so pleased with it that I might have even recorded it and put it on YouTube!  So for those of you who will never collect all the pinks and can't bear not seeing it before the 4DS comes out, come along with me on this journey...<br>

Now that's how you do a StreetPass puzzle.  The 3D effect is really outstanding too, though it's obviously not visible in the recording.  But the dudes are all zooming in and out and the screen really feels like it goes deep in there.  Yeah!
