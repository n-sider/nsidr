Whoa man, one more week until the Wu comes out "for people in America" oh ho ho not me. The information is really starting to seep out too.  Just today there was a new <a href="http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wiiu/wii-u-chat/0/0" target="_blank">Iwata Kas</a> about the Wii U Chat application.  And there was a FAQ that Nintendo posted on their Japanese website, lovingly <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=499370" target="_blank">put</a> into English by a message board goer.<br>

I for one have just started to reach the point of System Information Saturation that renders me contented enough that I can actually started getting excited about the games, which is what we really should be excited about anyway and not the stupid firmware.  <em>New Super Mario Bros. U</em> is going to be fantastic and <em>Nintendo Land</em> still looks gorgeous.  Those two are my guaranteed buys of course, but where I start to hit the WALL OF UNCERTAINTY is in deciding on a third game I might pick up cause games are awesome and I wanna see what else this thing can do when not under the raw, sexual guidance of Nintendo's silky hands.<br>

For a good while I was pretty sure <em>Darksiders II</em> would be my other game.  I was starting to get into the original again and the word on the street was that the PS3 and Xbox versions weren't really that great, performance-wise.  The Wii U version looks pretty great too, with all its Gamepad stuff!  But then for whatever reason I kinda lost interest in that.  <br>
<br>
Then word started getting out that <em>Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge</em> is actually a marked improvement on the apparently not-that-good original release.  Being a big fan of the first two Ninja Gaiden games I sure like the sound of that!  And with Nintendo publishing it&#8212;somehow&#8212;I'll probably be able to download it from the eShop instead of wasting extra money to import a stupid plastic slab with the game on it.<br>

<em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em> looks great too, and it even has all the extra DLC and costumes and everything on it right there.  And online play, which would be nice to take for a swing!  And as much as I should be sick of the series by now, we also have <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em> which will promise a few dozen hours of carefree online play itself and a reliably entertaining single-player shooty-fest.<br>
<br>
I can't decide!  I don't really want any of the other stuff.  My memories of games like <em>Red Steel</em> are not helping me when it comes to the apparent Ubisoft critical darling <em>ZombiU</em>, and my utter disinterest in all zombie-related forms of entertainment certainly doesn't help.  <em>Batman</em> will be great but I played <em>Arkham Asylum</em> not so long ago, and it looks pretty similar.  Mickey?  Dancing?  <em>Mass Effect</em>?  Nah.  There really are only a few solid winners there for me.<br>
<br>
I bet it'll end up being Ninja Gaiden.  But what if it sucks!!  Black Ops is probably the most expectedly reliable game there.  But Tekken has Nintendo characters in it!  Aw jeez aw man what are you guys gonna get?
