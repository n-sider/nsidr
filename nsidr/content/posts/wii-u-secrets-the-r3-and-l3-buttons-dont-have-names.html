You know those fancy buttons underneath the left and right sticks on the PlayStation 3 that are called R3 and L3?  They don't actually have any names on the Wii U.  The in-game documentation via prompts in Nintendo Land and Ninja Gaiden just say "Hold R" with a picture of a stick that has two little arrows above it.  I think this is similar to what the 360 does maybe?<br>

This shot's from the Internet browser, which has pictures that show the little "press in" arrow.  <em>Ninja Gaiden 3</em> uses a similar graphic.  Notably, <em>Nintendo Land</em> never actually shows a picture with an arrow, just says "Press (picture of stick)."  Whoa!<br>
<br>
So yep there's no official name.  SECRETS<br>
