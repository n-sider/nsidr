<p>I am obsessing about this 3DS XL. With every passing day it becomes more desirable, despite my initial critiques. But the breaking point is going to be pocketability. I don't always carry a bag, so whenever I walk someplace without one, I put that 3DS in my pocket. Aint no point in even having it if I can't earn those coins, get those StreetPass tags. So I made a 3DS XL in effigy out of a French bread pizza box.</p>

<p>It's too big. Yeah, it "fits" in my pocket, but it's ridiculous in there. Sitting down it'd be all crunched up, I had to angle it all weird to even get it in there in the first place (though the pointy box edges contributed, and those won't be on the actual unit)â€”it was just a mess. Serviceable at best, uncomfortable and awkward at worst. I could do it, but I don't wanna. DON'T WANNA<br /> <br /> Will the real system really be like that, though? The pointy edges certainly contributed to the weirdness. I just don't know!! I really gotta get my hands on the real thing, gotta be able to see how it feels, how the screen looks at my usual handheld-playing distance, how it fits in dem pockets. It's the first Nintendo hardware I've ever considered purchasing that I'm not happy to shell-out for sight-unseen. Maybe this is how normal people feel every day.</p>
