<em>Monster Hunter Tri</em> turned me into an instant fan of the series, a series I hadn't even heard of prior to its Wii iteration.  Since its release, I've played quite a bit of Monster Hunter.  It's one of three games I play online (the other two being <em>Mario Kart Wii</em> and <em>Mario Kart 7</em>), and I still hop on like clockwork every Friday to shoot the breeze with friends and battle a few mega beasties.  Still, this is a game I've been playing for around two years.  It's only natural that I'd eventually come up with something wacky to keep things interesting.<br>

Enter the Mad Bombing Run, something I initiated with some friends from GAF.  I sincerely doubt I'm the first to do this, but I did devise it on my own.  The rules are simple.  Get together with three comrades and attack a monster using bombs&#8212;only bombs.  Any kind of bomb is fair game&#8212;sonic, flash, dung, small barrel, large barrel, bounce&#8212;but no traps, and no weapons.  You can also use healing items, but that's it.  We targeted low level monsters to ensure the bombs alone would be enough to kill them.  The results were pyromaniacal hijinks!<br>

In the video, I'm Khory, and yes, that high pitched voice is supposedly mine, since it can't be anyone else's.  I do not sound like that.  It's an artifact of talking through a laptop on Skype, I swear.  I refuse to believe otherwise.<br>

If you find yourself looking for something to breathe some life into your own copy of Monster Hunter Tri (assuming you're a player), give the Mad Bombing Run a shot!<br>
