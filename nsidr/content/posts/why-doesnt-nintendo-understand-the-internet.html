Shigeru Miyamoto plays <em>Angry Birds</em>.   That means he has a smart phone.  Someone else at Nintendo probably has a phone too and on that phone they’ve downloaded a gaming app and seen online leaderboards or asynchronous multiplayer.  Heck, they’ve probably seen live multiplayer.  Someone over there is probably playing an online game right now.  <em>On a phone</em>.  So why is it, in 2012, that Nintendo still doesn’t seem to understand how to develop appropriate online systems for their own consoles and games?<br>

<h3>EXHIBIT A</h3><br>
The 3DS has one friend code to rule them all.  It works just like an XBox Live or PSN username.  You share these codes with your friends and you become part of each others' friend lists.  They can see when you are online and what you’re currently playing.  The best part is that this friend list is always there.  You can access it when you’re playing <em>Resident Evil: Revelations</em> and might even be hoping that someone somewhere is online so you can set up a match in <em>Mario Kart 7</em>.<br>
<br>
Yet here I am, playing <em>Mario Tennis Open</em> and I can’t invite anyone to my online match.  I can <em>see</em> a friend online and, judging by his avatar, he is a totally cool dude that would play with me, but there is no way whatsoever to get his attention.  Not only can I not send a game invite, I can’t message him with the system to tell him to join the tennis match I’ve opened up to friends.  I imagine him sitting across the world, playing <em>Super Mario 3D Land</em> and crying, because he really wants to play tennis with real people.  With me.<br>
<br>
<h3>EXHIBIT B</h3><br>
<em>Pikmin 3</em> does not have online multiplayer.  <em>Pikmin 2</em> had a fantastic two-player battle mode, and 3 will have some multiplayer modes as well.  They don't need to be online, and that's fine.  However, based on what they've told us, it isn't an offline multiplayer game because that's how they designed it, it's because it apparently "would be difficult."  Nintendo actively chose not to implement it.<br>

I’m thankful that Nintendo opted to focus on the aspects of Pikmin 3 they felt they could actually execute with a degree of quality.  I'd absolutely prefer a fantastic local-play-only video game that is perfect rather than one with a shoehorned-in online multiplayer mode.  Yet, what troubles me is the fact that replicating online features from over ten years ago seems to pose such a challenge to them.  There are some really terrible games in existence that have fantastic multiplayer implementation.  Nintendo is, somehow, behind budget game developers.  If there's no online multi because of game design decisions, say so, but don't feed me this "it would be too hard" crap!<br>

<h3>EXHIBIT C</h3><br>
Nintendo doesn’t think it’s important to tell us much of anything about the Wii U’s online interface.  Miiverse has been detailed somewhat (and seems really cool), but it’s also not what I <em>need</em> to know.  Where is the ability to message my friends and invite them into my games?  This is what we need to know.  This is what will break their online system.  If I can see "tweets" from my friends about an area of a game, but can’t interact with them, then the entire system is a bust.  You might as well pack the Wii U up and send it back because it’s not going to compete with anything else out there.  Period.  Not as a multiplayer machine anyway.<br>

Local multiplayer is a good thing and I’m glad Nintendo still supports it.  Pikmin 3 is going to have a local co-op mode, in fact.  That’s great news!  But this isn’t an either/or scenario, it’s a both/and.  I want Nintendo to embrace all kinds of gamers, just like they claim they want to.  I want online gamers to be happy, I want local gamers to be happy.  I want solo gamers to be able to isolate themselves from the Miiverse and friend messages while they dive deep into the next <em>Zelda</em>.  I want casual gamers to not have to jump through a hundred hoops if they want to try out punching a dude through the Internet.<br>
<br>
I want Nintendo to be for everyone, not just someone.
