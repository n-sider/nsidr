<p>Man I could say so many things about <em>Fire Emblem: Awakening</em>, but at this point all I really want to share is how brain-scramblingly amazing the soundtrack is. I beat the game last night, and got access to the sound test mode, and have just been listening to it all day at work.</p>

<p>SO, I am going to just shamelessly vomit out an assortment of Youtube links to songs here. Be wary of comments and what have you, lest you inadvertently spoil this or that. The song titles are pretty safe though. If any of these links ever end up going down for some reason, you can easily find the songs just by plugging their title into the 'tubes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWHLgEEtqmg" target="_blank">Conquest (Ablaze)</a> - The bass line on this one actually gives me a little bit of a Chrono Trigger feel.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTJO957WvoE" target="_blank">Divine Decree (Ablaze)</a> - I think these songs are all synth, including the vocals, which is pretty dag impressive.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x8J-c4cVec" target="_blank">Chaos (Ablaze)</a> - These "Ablaze" versions are what you get when you enter a battleâ€”a ton of more intense instrumentation is added to the map theme.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could.. seriously just list every single "Ablaze" song at this point, so MOVING ON</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1XVfcR2cvA" target="_blank">Id (Beginnings)</a> - When I first got the game, and this played on the file-select screen, I just sat there and listened to it for ages. It is the most calming thing ever.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKw0dkJoWHA" target="_blank">Monstrosity</a> - Yep we are in full-on megaboss music territory here, with the robot-chorus kicked into overdrive.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSz1l-0mC0s" target="_blank">Mastermind</a> - This is like an insane mix between a Final Fantasy final boss theme, some Hideo Kojima game, and... uh, Avatar? And it only plays for mere seconds if you kill the guy too fast!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bio99hoZVYI" target="_blank">Id (Purpose)</a> - This is basically the best song in the game, and perhaps the best song in ANY game. Okay I am riding a bit high on it at the moment but seriously this is the one that prompted me to make this post. Ride it out, it only gets better.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is just a tiny glimpse of some of the more high-intensity songs. There's really not a sour note among the full soundtrack. If you haven't played it already, maybe you should!!!</p>
<p>No seriously, play this game would you please. Even putting aside the soundtrack, the "actual game" is one of the most content-rich and ball-blastingly polished titles I've played in recent memory. I rate it a full bushel of video game units on your good-decider scale of choice.</p>
