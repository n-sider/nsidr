As I drag my zoom lens over poor Samus' Zero Suit-clad plasticine body I feel sorta like one of the dirty old men at Tokyo Game Show trying to snap upskirt shots of the cosplay girls.  Only this girl doesn't have a skirt to get up the skirt of, exactly, and she's Samus.  Samus!  Perhaps traditionally the Most Clad video game superhero in history, and here she is with legs over nine feet long.<br>

This figure, the Max Factory 1/8 Scale <em>Metroid Other M</em> Samus Aran Zero Suit Ver., as it is so catchily named on the package, was released just yesterday here in the land of all things pervy.  Preorders for the 7800 yen lust object (almost $100) have been sold out for months, though there are still a few available on Amazon.jp.  Naturally, I've been on the waiting list since the figure was first unveiled back in January, for some reason.  My trip down the long and painful road of acquiring questionably tasteful Japanese "plastic models" has only brought me into the possession of three in three years, which I suppose isn't so bad.  This one is pretty high quality!  The paint is smooth, and I love staring into Samus' pretty eyes, uguu~~~<br>

You can also see that this figure comes with a plastic Metroid that you can stand next to Samus if you want.  What you cannot see is that the Metroid smells absolutely repulsive and terrible.  Sort of like rotting meat!  Which is appropriate I guess.<br>

The figure is novel if for no other reason than being one of the most high-quality Nintendo-based models that has been released.  There's also a Figma-brand figure that's out now, if you're more a fan of Samus in her Power Suit.  I had to go with this one to match my skanky Yoko and Rei, forgive me.  Would you like two more pictures?  Okay.<br>

I feel wrong.
