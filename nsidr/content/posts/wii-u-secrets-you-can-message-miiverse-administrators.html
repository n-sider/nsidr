Not long after setting up my Miiverse information for the first time, I decided it was time to spruce up the decor a little bit by jazzin' out my profile message.  While I was fond of the original "Do, Re, Egon" greeting, it was time to push the envelope a little bit.  With the assistance of my favorite <a href="http://www.fiftyshadesgenerator.com" target="_blank">linguistic website</a>, I pieced together a polite and affable greeting I'd be happy to show you, your girlfriend, or your grandmother's girlfriend: "He knew I couldn't wait to consume the battered roadkill off his veiny quim prod."<br>
<br>
I figured the relatively obsfucated nature of the literary stylings would keep it safe from both underpaid humans or underpowered robots, but it was apparently caught within minutes, for whatever reason.  I had my suspicions that it may have been due to containing the word kill, until I later attempted to change my message to one that contained the word "farts" and was presented with an automatic message that prevented me from even entering it.  Maybe it was the conjunction of the words road AND kill together that allowed it to dodge the filter?  At any rate, the way it was handled was interesting: I received a message in my Miiverse sidebar from Miiverse Administration, which stated that my profile was determined to contain inappropriate content and the status was thus hidden from view.  The message further stated that after I had read the code of conduct and changed it, I was supposed to send them a message back!<br>

After I changed it to the much less threatening "Dinner roll," I clicked the "send message" button in the thread and was presented with a form offering me a series of pre-determined form statements I could give, some of them less complicit than others.  It took a couple hours after that, but my profile was unblocked.  Later, I posted a picture of Momiji's ludicrously gigantic kimono pillows among other photos which were almost 80% composed of blood and limbs, and received nine Yeahs without incident.<br>

So yes, these are real people who really see your stuff, and sometimes, they will even moderate your ass into the aether and wait for a reply.  Something about it felt neat to me, even though I was already thinking of new ways to talk about my thrill drill exploring the recesses of a vintage golf bag.<br>
