Back in those old gaming days I was full of wonder!  And why not.  I never knew when I might stumble on some stupid little trick in one game or another.  One of the first "Easter eggs" I remember ever finding was from when I was a kid continuously renting <em>Mega Man 2</em>.  I'd get impatient and hammer the buttons over and over and hold them down when I was picking a robot to fight, and sometimes, all the stars in the background would randomly change to birds for no reason whatsoever.  Turns out if you hold down the A and B buttons when you're picking a dude, exactly that happens!  It's great cause it's useless and stupid, but still kinda neat.  And there's a certain thrill in knowing that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, you're one of the few people to have ever found it.<br>

One of the greatest Nintendo games in recent memory, <em>Kid Icarus Uprising</em>, happens to have more than its fair share of Easter eggs buried in it.  Probably one of my favorite ones is when you hold down on the Circle Pad after you die, and the screen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lHnTi9gtOY" target="_blank">pans down to show</a> the old NES version of the Reaper gobblin' up your hearts.  But there's another, much more insignificant one that most gamers in America will probably never have a chance to discover!<br>

As you accumulate gems (in the form of StreetPass tags), a small bag in the lower right corner of the title screen appears, with the number of gems you have waiting to claim printed over it.  In itself I suppose that's nothing special, but the bag actually gets fuller depending on how many unclaimed tags you have waiting!  SHOCK AND AWE.  There are actually eight separate images for different sizes of the bag, all the way up to the maximum of fifty stored gems.  Since the bag empties as soon as you tap it, it's pretty likely that many gamers have never seen the totally full bag.  So I took it upon myself to chronicle the eight states of the bag in picture form!  I prepared this professional-looking chart.<br>

As you can see, there are five different bag fullnesses up to nineteen gems, and only three more from twenty until the fifty gem maximum.  It might be no NES Reaper or even floaty Mega Man 2 birds, but how many people do you think have ever actually seen this bag?  Holy shit, look at how bloated it is, all fat with gems!  It is ripe for the dumping.  This is so incredible that I am <span style="color: purple">sorry to have kept you waiting</span> to see it, a, aha, ah. Ah
