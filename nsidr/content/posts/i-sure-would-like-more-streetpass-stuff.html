I tried to space it out as long as I could, but last week I finally got the last hat in <em>StreetPass Mii Plaza</em>.  I finish new puzzles no more than a week after they come out.  I have reached the maximum limit for "fantastic" ratings (yes, there is a limit for some reason, it is 100).  I have 300 play coins waiting, and have gotten all but a handful of accomplishments.  <br>
<br>
This despite the seeming impossibility of it all back when the <em>Find Mii II</em> update first dropped.<br>

What is left for me, as an exhausted StreetPasser?  Right now, not much.  Half the fun of carrying my 3DS around with me all the time is to get those Mii Plaza tags!  Which is why I really hope Nintendo has something more tucked up their sleeves ready to go real soon.  The bungy part of all this is that it's not the first time this has happened to me!  Back in October last year, before the <em>Mario Kart</em> drop that would signal the arrival of actual games for the system, I ran into the same exhaustion of StreetPass Mii Plaza goodies, rendering my 3DS so uninteresting I didn't carry it for almost two months.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am sure more is on the way, but what?  It is fun to speculate.<br>
<div id="spillbreak"></div><br>
Would a new game be merely <em>Find Mii III</em>, or another implementation of those StreetPassed Miis?  I like to imagine the suite of Mii Plaza games growing along with the system.  I could see maybe some kind of platformer where&#8212;a la Evangelion or something&#8212;Miis could only continue forward for so long until their "batteries" ran out and they needed to be replaced with the next one in the list.  Higher level Miis could go further, jump higher (maybe over road-blocking obstacles), or maybe have stronger abilities.  A <em>Metroid</em>-style adventure game wouldn't be far off that mark either, leveraging the color system, which would be easy to translate by throwing up progression obstacles like in the Find Mii games based on character abilities.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we earn hats now, but what if there are other things down the line too?  Mounts?!  Accessories?  It's interesting to think about what else we could earn for our Miis and what could be changed through further system updates.<br>

Play coins are also something that I'd be happy to see get some serious sinks.  We can buy pieces for puzzles now and hire Find Mii allies, but what if there was something really far off and grand like <em>NSMB2</em>'s million-coin goal?  I would love some kind of ridiculous massive puzzle with a thousand pieces, little groups of pink squares spread out everywhere, some gold squares that could only be bought with heavy coin expenditures (think like twenty coins a piece and some special pieces that cost a hundred or even the maximum three hundred coins to buy).<br>
<br>
It's all just rampant mass guessing on my part and who knows if anything like this will ever come to pass, but I sure hope they do it sooner rather than later cause I am tired of all these tags being cute but worthless!  I wanna play with my tags again instead of just saying hello then moving on without playing.  THEY WANNA PLAY!  I cannot be the only one.
