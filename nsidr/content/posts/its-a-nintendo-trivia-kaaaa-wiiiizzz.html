<br>
<div class="box"><h3>Answer key:</h3><br>
1. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">Birdo, our lovable egg spitter, and the ostrich-looking critter named Ostro had their names switched during the end credits crawl.</span><br>
<br>
2. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">A voice actor!  Before Mario became super in his own cartoons, he was an antagonist to Donkey Kong during the DK segments of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmfT-YPXo4M" target="_blank"><em>Saturday Supercade</em></a> and was voiced by Peter Cullen.</span><br>
<br>
3. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">MCA Universal studios sued Nintendo over the name and premise of <em>Donkey Kong</em> due to similarities with their <em>King Kong</em> property.  Ultimately the court found that Universal had never trademarked King Kong, it was in the public domain, and Nintendo won the lawsuit.</span><br>
<br>
4. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">An evil, Link-eating version of Kirby can be found in Eagle's Tower in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</em>.</span><br>
<br>
5. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">Who knew Bowser was so poetic?  This is from<em> Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</em>.</span><br>
<br>
6. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">On the TV, the Game Boy games were framed within selectable borders.  If left idle, the borders would begin to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTyqRA9_lJM&amp;feature=results_main&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL5A5AD3F4E0AE2174" target="_blank">animate</a>.</span>  <br>
<br>
7. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">Pols Voices were sensitive to sound.  Yelling into the Famicom's built in microphone would kill them.  This method was unique to Japan as the NES lacked a mic.</span><br>
<br>
8. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">Nope, not <em>Mario Paint</em>.  The first appearance of the song was in a Game Boy game titled <em>X</em>.  X only saw release in Japan.</span><br>
<br>
9. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">Falco is a Blue Pheasant (<em>Phasianus colchicus</em>).  If you thought he was some sort of falcon, you're in good company.  Peppy <em>Hare</em>?  Slippy <em>Toad</em>?  <em>Fox</em> McCloud?  Yeah, I thought the name Falco implied he was a falcon too.</span> <br>
<br>
10. <span class="spoiler" title="Click to reveal spoiler">Look no further than issue #2.  The cover featured Simon Belmont holding onto Dracula's severed head.  Parents called in complaining that it gave their kids nightmares.  Ahh, such bygone days of pre-<em>Mortal Kombat</em> innocence.</span></div>
