Time sure flies when you're working overtime.  It's nearly November 18th already.  How did that happen?  The launch of the Wii U is just a day away, and by early Sunday morning (or late Saturday night), Nintendo's next console will have landed on store shelves&#8212;and for everyone lucky enough to have snagged one&#8212;living rooms across the continent.  <br>
<br>
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-375-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
But not mine.  For the first time in three generations of Nintendo consoles (and unlike <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/posts/being-calm-before-the-wii-u-storm" target="_blank">Cory</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/posts/news-alert-the-wii-u-release-date-is-one-month-away-so-lets-plan-our-exact-future-behav" target="_blank">Brandon</a>), I won't be picking up a Wii U at launch.  Why, you ask?  It's not that I don't want one, it's just because of money&#8212;as in I have none not already spoken for by groceries and bills.  Eventually the system will be mine though, so I've put a list of launch-window games that I'll definitely be considering (and you should too!) when that day comes.<br>

<strong><span class="size_6">The Wonderful 101</span></strong>  <br>
<br>
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-377-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
<strong>What it is:</strong>  Take control of a growing crowd of superheroes and use their combined powers to navigate through a city while battling huge alien robots.  It's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XzUct7SpdE" target="_blank">mass super hero action</a> game, and I can't wait to find out what that means.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why I want it:</strong> If nothing else, the Wii expanded my horizons.  It made me a connoisseur of the niche, the offbeat, and the quirky&#8212;and you don't get much quirkier than <em>The Wonderful 101</em>.  If the Pikmin were Power Rangers, they might star in a game like this.  As a fan of the <em>Pikmin</em> games, I find taking that basic concept into this more action-oriented direction intriguing.  I'm also really attracted to the game's visual aesthetic.  The urban areas seen thus far have a very playset look to them, and the robots are reminiscent of Lego or Erector set constructions when they explode.  I wonder if that was just an artistic choice or if there's actually more to it, akin to the original <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> being a story of some kid's toys beating each other up.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="size_6">Rayman Legends</span></strong><br>
<br>
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-378-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
<strong>What it is:</strong>  In 2011, Ubisoft released <em>Rayman Origins</em>, a gorgeous and frantically-paced 2D platformer.  <em>Rayman Legends</em> is the sequel.  Up to four players can control characters on the TV, while a fifth can use the GamePad to control Murphy, a grinning fly with special abilities.  Murphy can cut ropes, operate machinery, or even play musical rhythm games while aiding the rest of the players on their mad dash to the end of the level.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why I want it:</strong>  Rayman Origins was fantastic.  I loved the fluid animation, the funky art, the running on walls and ceilings, and the slap happy combat&#8212;it was a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmVtkqypEBw" target="_blank">screwball cartoon</a> of a game and it was hard in a good way.  Legends promises more of the same and new stuff too, making it one of my top picks.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="size_6">New Super Mario Bros. U</span></strong><br>
<br>
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-376-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
<strong>What it is:</strong>  As a love-letter to the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> series, the <em>New Super Mario Bros. </em>series features classic 2D side-scrolling gameplay with copious amounts of platforming and Koopa stomping.  The Wii U's <em>New Super Mario Bros. U</em> adds new power-ups like a flying squirrel suit for gliding and clinging to walls, and baby Yoshis that blow bubbles or illuminate areas.  The chaotic multiplayer action returns with the addition of asymmetric play via the GamePad, which allows one player to create platforms to aid or hinder other players and stun enemies.  This will be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQHa4qindfE" target="_blank">Mario's first HD outing</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why I want it:</strong> For the Nintendo fan, Mario games are some of the most reliable games for solid fun you can find.  The NSMB series is a bit vanilla, but I'm a fan of 2D platformers so I'll be more than happy to snap up Mario's latest contribution.  I'm also pleased to see the artistic ante has been upped with some creative environments.  Too bad we're stuck listening to many of the same old tunes.  I've never been a fan of NSMB's musical themes.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="size_6">Pikmin 3</span></strong><br>
<br>
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-379-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
<strong>What it is:</strong>  The Pikmin series is composed of two strategy games that involve managing an army (up to 100 individuals at a time) of tiny creatures called Pikmin.  In addition to the classic Pikmin characters, <em>Pikmin 3</em> introduces rock Pikmin, which can break armor or other hard objects.  The graphics seem to have also gotten a nice upgrade from the second GameCube installment.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why I want it:</strong>  Pikmin 3 is only a few months away but very little has been revealed about it.  My enthusiasm stems from how much I enjoyed the previous two games.  There is something incredibly alluring about playing as tiny creatures and seeing the world from their perspective.  Collecting mundane objects such as batteries, bits of fruit and other cast-offs suddenly takes on an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxWIvaD2XQI" target="_blank">aura of the fantastic</a> when said objects are several times larger than you.  I look forward to again swarming giant enemies, and feeling guilty each time a Pikmin dies in battle and its little ghost floats away.<br>

<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-381-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
<strong>What it is:</strong>  Go on an adventure, solve puzzles and collect Starites.  Oh yeah, you can also make anything you type appear in the game.  <em>Anything</em>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why I want it:</strong> Because I want a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXhO1oPPrS8" target="_blank">jet propelled rabbit</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="size_6">Tank! Tank! Tank!</span></strong><br>
<br>
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-380-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Tank! Tank! Tank! for the Wii U is a port of the original arcade action game where you drive tanks and battle giant monsters, tiny pictures of your friends' faces floating around your screen at all times.  Multiplayer is the main focus here.  Players can square off against each other or team up to take down towering bosses.  One mode even has you control a giant mechanical ape boss and duke it out with the other tank driving players.<br>
<br>
<strong>Why I want it:</strong>  Surely, blowing up <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgndOkWGk1A" target="_blank">giant mechanical spiders</a> with absurd overkill weapons is universally appealing, right?  It looks like fun to me at least, and I think my nephews would get a kick out of it too.  I'm a bit concerned about how much content the game offers when considering its price of entry, but a solid multiplayer game like this can easily earn its keep if you have friends who like to play games.<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="size_6">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</span></strong><br>
<br>
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline/img-382-inline.jpg" alt="Inline Image" class="image_styled"></div><br>
<strong>What it is:</strong>  It's goddamned <em>Monster Hunter</em>!<br>
<br>
<strong>Why I want it:</strong>  <em>Monster Hunter Tri</em> came out in April all the way back in 2010.  That means I've been playing that game for roughly two years now.  I hop online with a couple friends somewhat regularly and we throw down against a dragon or two.  To say I am craving new monsters to hunt is an understatement, and <em>Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</em> nearly triples the boss roster with both unique new monsters and alternate species of familiar beasts.  There are also new weapons and armor to forge, and new environments to explore.  While this game is being offered on both the 3DS and Wii U, I like my Monster Hunter on the TV, and the addition of online play is a must for me.  I won't be buying a Wii U at launch, but I aim to have one in time for this game.  It's not a hobby,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wkQGEpRgL0" target="_blank"> it's a lifestyle</a>.
