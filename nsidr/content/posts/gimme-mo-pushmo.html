I never beat <em>Pushmo</em>, because it is hard as hell.  The person who lives in the same house as me has stolen the 3DS on occasion to grind through a few levels, but I think neither of us will probably ever reach the diabolical end.  Anyway, who cares about all that.  We've done enough pushin' anyway.  But I am not done with Pushmo!  The little guy, I mean, the little Mo, who I call Pushmo even if that is not his name.  Wikipedia says that his name is Mallo, and the puzzles are called Pushmos, and man that is stupid, so I will continue to call Mallo Pushmo, like how the Sears Tower isn't really the Willis Tower.  <br>

But anyway, I was watching Pushmo being played last night, and each time a new level started, I was like aw man, Pushmo, I miss you!  What I mean is, Pushmo, come back!  Come back to us!  But hey, could you please be in a game that is nothing like your current game?  I have had enough of this mind-ruining shit.  You know what I want you for?<br>

A platforming game!  Pushmo 2!  A sequel Pushmo that in true olde-tyme fashion is virtually nothing like the original Pushmo.  Pushmo as a character is cute and great, and he has all kinda neat moves that could be used in a new sort of game.  Nintendo could do well to have a friendly and creative new mascot to parade around!  I am thinking a sort of <em>Super Paper Mario</em> meets Kirby type thing here, utilizing the Pushmo's abilities to push and pull.  Your main attack mechanics could involve pushing or pulling objects or enemies into each other.  Maybe in the offseason Pushmo learned how to carry things, and you could carry enemies through the level to push forcefully into other enemies.  Different enemy combinations could change the enemies into different sorts of blocks to assist you through the level and provide you various movement options.  Maybe you could even pull larger enemies apart to expose their gooey liquid centers!  Perhaps the strategy in defeating bosses would involve strategically pulling and pushing various parts of them to get inside them, like a giant <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> boss, and then curing their inner disease with your Pushmo magic.<br>
<br>
The actual platforming mechanics could involve Pushmo's basic gameplay functions, in a less mentally taxing way as we start, and getting more difficult as we go.  To really show off the 3D, we could have multiple progression layers, both vertical and horizontally scrolling levels.  Maybe to make it from a frontal plane to some other concurrent path in the background layer, we'd need to solve a small, singular Pushmo puzzle that would then ingeniously collapse and give us a path to the background, where we could acquire some whatsits or find a secret exit!  Perhaps we could acquire bits of Pushmo puzzles as we go that fill in certain pieces of a traditional Pushmo puzzle that must be scaled at world's end to confront one of our big bosses.<br>

This would also be their chance to include the original Pushmo-type gameplay with some extra options that the original game didn't necessarily have.  Imagine simultaneous Pushmo-solving races!  Wi-Fi trading of your own Pushmo puzzles, this time without the QR codes.  We could have puzzle-creation enhancements too like maybe an algorithm that determines if your puzzle is actually solvable.  <br>
<br>
They already have a great setting, a unique cast of characters in Papa Blox and the Pushmo kids, and a nice little world there with Pushmo Park.  A sequel to something like Pushmo provides legitimate reasons for its own existence&#8212;expanding and fleshing out ideas that have been there from the start but are begging to be pulled and pushed!  And the first game is critically acclaimed to boot!  What more could you ask for when it comes to launching a daring new sequel?<br>
<br>
Think Pushmo, but more, expanded, implemented!  The basic set of moves that our little man could be endowed with could really be enough for Nintendo's brilliant dudes to play around with, I think.  And who doesn't like that little guy?  If Nintendo finally sees fit to give me a big old Pushmo adventure to mo myself through one day, I'll be a happy fell-mo indeed.
