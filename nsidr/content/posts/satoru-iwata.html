<p>I tried to write something eloquent here, and found that I just don't have the words.</p>
<p>So here are some pictures of us as children, with the man who embodied everything that could possibly be right about how to make video games, how to value a team of artists and visionaries, and how to inspire impressionable boys and girls to make stupid websites like this one.</p>
<p>He will never be replaced.</p>
