Wired's Chris Kohler sat down with <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> director, Yoshiaki Koizumi, for a lengthy discussion on how he started with Nintendo, what it's like to work with Miyamoto and how some of the gameplay elements of Galaxy came to be.<br />
<br />
Some of the more interesting pieces revolved around how cryptic Miyamoto could be when it came to what he wanted done and how Koizumi sometimes had to slip story elements past the legendary game maker.<br />
<br />
"I would sort of try to find sneaky ways to get [story elements] in without them noticing too much," Koizumi said of his early work. "These are aspects of the games that Miyamoto wasn't nearly as fond of, and occasionally didn't like."<br />
