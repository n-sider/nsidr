According to <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=14256">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Nintendo UK general manager <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=991">David Yarnton</a>, said during an event at the London Science Museum, that over three million players have used the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service.  The Wi-Fi Connection free online service has been used in Nintendo DS titles such as Tony Hawk, Mario Kart DS, and Animal Crossing Wild World.  In the next few months more Wi-Fi compatible titles will be released including Metroid Prime Hunters and Tetris DS.  Later this year, the service will also be implemented into Nintendo's next-generation home console dubbed Project Revolution.<br><br>

Yesterday <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=NBV6BPSS9OwjiB6OsD4X4Bt2xSbx9ytD&page=">Nintendo of America</a> noted that more than 550,000 gamers have logged on to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in its first seven weeks of service while over 10 million wireless game connections have been made. It's not fully clear what the "three million players" Yarnton is specifically referring to.<br><br>

The Science Museum, where Yarnton made the speech about Wi-Fi Connection and the upcoming European releases of Electoplankton and Brain Training, have entered into a GBP 1 million partnership with Nintendo over the next four years.  The deal is said to include touring shows designed to bring in new audiences and a "launch pad" gallery, perhaps similar to what Nintendo is currently doing in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1666">Japan</a>.
