IGN has posted a recap of Nintendo's discussion of its Revolution console at the Games Convention 2005.
<br><br>
<blockquote><font size="2">
"In the console market, beginning in 2006 our wi-fi capable flagship Revolution will set new landmarks," said Bernd Fakesch, spokesman and General Manager of Nintendo of Europe.  "By 'expanding the definition of gaming' we don't only mean an advance towards new limits of gaming, but also to new potential players. We want to win over new people and inspire them, those who have never thought about taking a controller into their hands -- more girls, young women, adults, and also elderly players. Certainly in the process we won't neglect the fan community. Germany needs new kinds of games and Nintendo is certainly the company that is best-suited to supply them. We hold a unique position in the market. We are among the worldwide leading hardware manufacturers and at the same time we are among the leading software developers. And that's both for handhelds and home consoles. Additionally, we have decades of experience where we have focused our entire know-how on the content of games and gaming fun."</font></blockquote>
