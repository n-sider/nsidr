In a press release, Namco Bandai Games America has revealed a little bit about the game we knew almost nothing about days ago: <i>Soulcalibur Legends</i>.<br />
<br />
The game follows Siegfried and franchise characters old and new, seeking out "ultimate power in order to save an empire from destruction".  Players will fight using the Remote and Nunchuk, performing moves and combos.  Sword-fighting will make an appearance.<br />
<br />
Soulcalibur Legends is set for a winter release.
