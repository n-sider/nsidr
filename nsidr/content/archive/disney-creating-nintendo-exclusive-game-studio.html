Walt Disney Co., recent acquirers of CGI movie-makers Pixar (most recently known for <i>Cars</i>) and the company behind the Disney Channel, has announced they will be creating their own studio called Fall Line in Salt Lake City to make titles exclusively for Nintendo platforms.<br />
<br />
The new studio will make titles for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Wii</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> as well as the venerable <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a>.  Scott Novis, who led the team behind the Cars video game, will head the new studio.<br />
<br />
CEO Robert Iger noted back in September that he feels Disney can earn more money running its own studio and developing its own games rather than by running a licensing operation.  In the past 19 months, Disney has bought or started three other game studios and has racked up 600 employees for its video game operations.
