So here's the deal. We held a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2449">wet t-shirt contest</a> here at N-Sider. We (well, most of us) thought it was a great idea. Take a funny picture of a t-shirt in some wet fashion and win a t-shirt! It sounded simple and nearly effortless to us. We were horribly mistaken and for that, we apologize. Either you guys don't have cameras or you're just not interested in free t-shirts, because the contest received no entries. None. Zilch. Nada. Other words to describe the number 0.<br />
<br />
This time around, we're making it even <i>easier</i>. All you have to do is tell us what you think would be a <i>worse</i> contest idea than our Wet T-Shirt contest one. Basically, we're looking for the "Worst. Contest idea. Ever." here. Points will be awarded for humor and originality, but really, anything has a decent chance here.<br />

So, if you want to win one of the above N-Sider-picked speciality gamer-tees, send an email to <a href="mailto:contests@n-sider.com">contests@n-sider.com</a> with an entry containing your "Worst. Contest idea. Ever." and the following:<br />
<br />
Your Name:<br />
Your Email:<br />
SplitReason Newsletter: Yes or No<br />
<br />
As with our previous failure, this contest will last two weeks.  So you've got until early on October 23rd.  Good luck!
