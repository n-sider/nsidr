The Japanese Virtual Console will soon welcome a new member to its ever-growing family. Papa Neo Geo makes a VC debut September 11, with two more games to follow later that month.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Fatal Fury</i> (September 11)</li>
  <li><i>Magician Lord</i> (September)</li>
  <li><i>World Heroes</i> (September)</li>
  </ul><br />
They will be priced at 900 points each. There is no news, yet, on when Neo Geo games will show up on Virtual Consoles outside of Japan.
