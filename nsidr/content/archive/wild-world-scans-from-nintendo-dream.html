<p>Jeux-France has <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news13077_animal-crossing-ds-en-images.html">scans from an article in Nintendo Dream</a> about Nintendo's upcoming Wi-Fi Connection title, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a>.</p>

<p>The scans don't reveal much that we don't already know about the game, but inventory shots show that players will have a new tool in their inventory: a slingshot, presumably for shooting down Pete the pelican to make him drop his mail among many other things.</p>

<p>In addition, Wild World news-followers who read  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-2005-animal-crossing-ds">our E3 2005 coverage of the game</a> and wondered how they were going to conveniently sell multiple items to resident capitalist Tom Nook can now breathe easier: apparently, the touch screen splits in two, and you can drag items you wish to sell out of your inventory on the bottom and into a holding area on the top, enabling you to sell as many items as you wish all at once.  Seeing this interface in action gives hope that many chores from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=135">Animal Crossing</a> for GameCube made tedious by the interface will be much more streamlined in this Nintendo DS sequel.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing: Wild World is still on-target for release December 5 in North America &mdash; barely over a month away.</p>
