4 Color Rebellion has a first-look at the North American <i>New Super Mario Brothers</i> <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/03/07/new-super-box-art/">box-art</a> for Nintendo DS.
<br>
<br>
The title is slated for a May 7th release, and will combine old-school Mario mechanics with brand-new ones (such as the ability to compete head-to-head for goals within a stage). Stay tuned to N-Sider for more info as the release date approaches.
