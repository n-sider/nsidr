<p>As was noted yesterday, there were several discrepancies between online retailers regarding the release date for <i>Resident Evil 4</i>.  Some had it listed as coming out later this year while others had it scheduled for a February 2005 release.</p>

<p>A representative at Capcom has confirmed the title is still scheduled for a winter 2004 release in North America.</p>   

<p>"In Europe, Resident Evil 4 will ship early 2005, this has not changed," the Capcom representative told Spong.com.  "In the US, there has been no change. The game will be shipped in winter of this year, slightly earlier than Europe, due to the additional localization in the region."</p>
