<h3>[12.19] XXV - Tomorrow Never Knows</h3><P>Dear Heart Containers,</P>

<P>A lot can happen in a year!  In fact, it has been one entire year since the last issue of Heart Containers walked these hallowed halls.  In some respects, the fact that this installment arrives a year later, with some of the same letters that were sent in last time, is almost like an enjoyable exercise in time travel.</P>

<P>What were we doing last year at this time?  I was playing the new Animal Crossing on my regular-sized DS, anxiously awaiting all the revelations of next year's E3, gearing up for my trip to Pennsylvania for the holiday season, seeing the crappy King Kong movie, ordering Electroplankton off of Nintendo's online store because I was sure it would be limited and SELL OUT REALLY FAST and watching the damned Colts get disappointed in their run for the Super Bowl (hopefully this year will be better).</P>

<P>But a lot can happen in a year!  Now instead of playing Animal Crossing on our regular DSes, we're not playing Animal Crossing at all on our shiny new DS lites!  Not only did we see the revelations of E3, but a lot of us even own our future-crazy Wii systems!  I live in Pennsylvania now so I hardly need to drive there.  Electroplankton turned out being an <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Electroplankton-Nintendo-DS-NEW-SEALED-RARE-FREESHIP_W0QQitemZ150070847301QQihZ005QQcategoryZ62053QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem">alright idea</a>, even though that's not my auction.  King Kong totally blew, and this year the Colts are at it again!</P>

<P>Some more unexpected things happened too in N-Sider land.  Heart Containers are no longer four pieces, but five (thanks, Twilight Princess), we're doing <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=558">our</a> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=547">own</a> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=561">reviews</a> now, and the site's even been re-arranged a little bit.</P>

<P>Since we're TRAVELLING THROUGH TIME, the year-old letters are even a little bit relevant!  And I even got some new ones today from my bestest buds in the #n-sider chat.</P>

<P>Oh this year I even finally learned to use Photoshop instead of just Paint all the time!  Look at this old Heart Containers graphic:</P>

<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/hearts25regginator1.jpg"></center></P>

<P>And look how cool it is now that I've updated it in Photoshop!</P>

<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/hearts25regginator2.jpg"></center></P>

<P>Truly it has been a good year!</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Hey Brandon, happy xmas and new year and all that jazz.</P>
 
<P>I was just wondering if you or any of your readers have ever, after a heavy night and a 6am alarm call, staggered out of the house carrying your GameCube instead of your laptop?</P>
 
<P>I mean, what the hell were Nintendo's designers thinking? It's black, its square, its got a handle! Just asking for confusion. It got me thinking.</P>
 
<P>It's not like this is an isolated incident! Nintendo routinely base their consoles on innocent household appliances to trick you into using them 24/7.</P>
 
<P>Take a look at their consoles through the ages:</P>
 
<P>Game&Watch: Clearly designed as an 80's TV remote control, probably to brainwash elderly relatives at Christmas: "Lets watch those nice pretty boys tell ugly men how to dress! I'll just push this button here... hmm? Why, it's a monkey, how sweet. What's that barrel? Auuugh! BAD Monkey! JUMP TINY BEEPING MAN, JUUUMP!"</P>
 
<P>NES: Toaster. Or video recorder. Possibly mailbox. Once, memorably in our house, unintended makeshift gerbil cage. Cunning blighters, these Japanese.</P>
 
<P>Gameboy: Geiger Counter. Long Island and Chernobyl explained right there.</P>
 
<P>SNES: Even more cunning here. In Japan and Europe, chic, classy understated smooth lines, while a magical button caused the top to fly open and display the goods. Exactly like our girlfriends. In the US, it looked like a fridge. I'm saying nothing.</P>
 
<P>N64: Pile-driven tortoise. Sorry? What? Well, we had one at OUR house. </P>
 
<P>GBA: I never owned a GBA, but the old style blue one looks like someone dropped a diving-mask wearing Smurf in a car compactor. Fine, I'm reaching.</P>
 
<P>DS: Trouser press.</P>
 
<P>So, are Nintendo planning to replace every single object in our lives with consoles that look like them? And, if they are, why? Is this some Day Of The Triffids plot? More importantly, will the final design of the Revolution in actual fact be based on, say, a vacuum cleaner? Or a cup of tea? WHERE WILL IT ALL END?</P>
 
<P>Also, what the hell does the GBA look like, because I couldn't think of anything :-)</P>
 
<P>Thanks, love the site.</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Dear Brandon,</P>

<P>I'm going to ride right past the "what did you get for Christmas" thing, because it's now February -- or, as those crazy French Canadians say, Fevrier. Which brings me to my topic: Valentine's Day.</P>

<P>What can you possibly get a gamer for Valentine's Day, Brandon? I ask you. A chocolate PS2? Cinnamon zombies? One doesn't normally use the words "gamer" and "romance" in the same sentence, but what about that poor lone gaming geek who sheds a single tear while they rock out on Guitar Hero? As much as I hate to admit it, nerds are people too, and I'm sure they have hearts locked away in those cavernous combo-filled chest regions. The alliteration alone makes a small piece of my heart bleed.</P>

<P>So, the question is: can you come up with any clever Valentine's Day suggestions? For example, how can one successfully combine the use of body paint while playing Smash Bros.? I look forward to your next mind-blowing update, Brandon.</P>

<center><b>--- Closing Comments ---</b></center><P>That's right!</P>
<P>You are watching on your computer screens the very final super ultra last edition of Heart Containers.  It has gone on for twenty-five glorious editions!</P>
<P>In a way, it is sort of the spirit of the season.  After all, even Rocky Balboa has come back for ANOTHER SHOT so that he might finally hang up his gloves in style after the sour taste of Rocky V.  Perhaps it is simply the nature of all excellent things!  That they must one day end, fade into the collective memories of the consciousness of our floaty masses.</P>
<P>It has been an absolute honor having a semi-public outlet for my ridiculous Paint efforts.  I hope you all enjoyed the humiliation.  I know I sure became a better person because of it.  If you remember the very first edition of Heart Containers, you might recall that the column used to provide coherent and useful responses.  I checked and I think you can note the exact point that the column slipped into decline!  For me it was this image:</P>
<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/heartsfight3.jpg"></center></P>
<P>It is generally a good rule of thumb to assume that any time you see Martha Stewart's head in a toilet there are problems on the horizon.</P>

<P>In all seriousness it almost makes me a little bit sad to leave the column behind.  I feel like I'm closing off a portion of my life, really!  But we all must keep going, WITH OR WITHOUT HEART CONTAINERS.</P>

<p>Perhaps some day I will even come back for <i>one more shot at the title</i>.  Any final secret thoughts may be e-mailed to me at the address down there.
