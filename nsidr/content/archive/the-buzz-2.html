<H3>The Buzz: Edition #2</H3>



<p>Welcome to the return of <i>The Buzz</i>, an intersecting plane where the latest rumors and news meet for an interesting read. This second issue is short but sweet with some interesting details on some surprise sequels.



<p><b>Quiet Sequels</b><br> <p>While Nintendo has confirmed big name sequels like Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart, and the next chapter of The Legend of Zelda; Nintendo also hopes to breathe life into the more niche franchises on the GameCube. Development on Nintendo's quirky hybrid of mech-action-adventure better known as Custom Robo is now well underway. Nintendo and subsidiary Marigul (Nintendo and Recruit joint-venture) are producing the Noise developed Custom Robo V3 for the Nintendo GameCube tentatively scheduled for release sometime in early winter 2003. Fans of Doshin The Giant also have more to look forward to than the all-new GameCube remake as a second GameCube edition of Doshin is already in the planning stages. 



<p><b>Pocket Music being reworked?</b> 



<p>Last year Nintendo made a surprise appearance during the Fall TGS 2001 and announced a new game titled Pocket Music. The game was actually a pocket-sized music studio where you could create and edit your own music and play them on your GBA mp3 style. Developed by the Nintendo Co. R&D2 group, producer Kazuhiko Taniguchi stated the game was originally slated for the Game Boy Color but development team decided to switch platforms because the GBA offered a significant boost in audio capabilities and voice channels. Rumor is the developer is now experimenting with a second-platform change involving none other than the GameCube. It's unclear if the game will just offer GameCube compatibility, or if it will change lead platforms completely but still offer GBA compatibility. Currently, R&D2 (Koro Koro Kirby 2) and EAD (Animal Forest +) are the two leading in-house sectors inside Nintendo's HQ working on GBA-GCN cross compatible software.





<p><b>Defect to Cube 3</b> 



<p>Although not directly related to the GameCube or Game Boy Advance, we've heard details of an unreleased 64DD title by the famed R&D1 team of Nintendo Co. Detective Club 3 was supposedly in development for the Nintendo 64DD and was going to be released periodically via multiple disks (each one a different chapter) through the now defunct Randnett system. While this may interest the more fluent Japanese Nintendo fans who experienced the original, it certainly opens the door for the project to see the light of day on the GameCube.
