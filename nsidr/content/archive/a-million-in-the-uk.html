<p>By way of GamesIndustry.biz comes news that the DS <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=14203">has sold a million units</a> in the United Kingdom since its launch earlier this year.</p>

<p>The report states Nintendo's saying several UK retailers are out of stock of the device, driven by demand for titles like <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><i>Nintendogs</i></a>, which has sold 1.6 million copies across Europe since its release in October.  Of course, this fanned the redesign rumor flames somewhat, leading to a denial from NOE this week.</p>
