Sega has announced that Wii-exclusive Sonic series entry <i>Sonic and the Secret Rings</i> will hit North American retail quite soon, on February 20.<br />
<br />
Sonic and the Secret Rings was built from the ground up for Wii, unlike recent multiplatform release <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i>, and features a very different play style from recently-released 3-D Sonic games.  In Secret Rings, Sonic is always running forward, and the player can "steer" him by tilting a sideways-held Wii Remote.  Buttons are used to make Sonic slow down or jump, and the game will feature a myriad special moves such as tilting the controller forward to execute a homing attack.<br />
<br />
Sonic and the Secret Rings has been garnering interest for returning to the series' roots as well as for largely positive previews&mdash;not to mention being a potential bright spot in the somewhat slow trickle of Wii releases system owners find themselves in at the moment.
