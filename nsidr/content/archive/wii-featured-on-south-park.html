Many of our American readers have no doubt heard about the Nintendo Wii being featured on last night's episode of South Park.<br />
<br />
Among the many plots and storylines in the show, Eric Cartman is obsessed with Nintendo's new console, the Wii. He waits outside EV Games to purchase the system&mdash;which releases in three weeks&mdash;and becomes increasingly impatient.  After deciding to freeze himself to make the three weeks go faster, Cartman ends up 500 years in the future when video games, and therefore the Wii, do not exist.<br />
<br />
When we contacted Nintendo PR about the Wii's appearance on the show, they said "Nintendo is very excited that Wii was on South Park&mdash;it's a true indication that Wii is already reaching pop culture status before it's even been launched and is hopefully going to be the must-have product for the holidays..."<br />
<br />
Another interesting item of note: the idea to put the Wii on South Park was all Comedy Central, while Nintendo was aware of the epsiode, they had no involvement of the content or treatment of their console on the series.<br />
<br />
Nintendo Wii launches November 19th in North America, and part two of the South Park episode mentioned above airs Wednesday, November 8th, at 10pm on Comedy Central.
