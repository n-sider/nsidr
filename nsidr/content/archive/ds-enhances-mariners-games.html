Nintendo continues to expand their demographic by offering DS downloadable software at the Seattle Mariners' Safeco Field. For $8 a game, fans of the team can bring their DS&mdash;or buy a brand new white DS Lite branded with the Mariners logo&mdash;and download software that will surely enhance their enjoyment of the game.<br />
<br />
The software enables fans to:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Watch the Mariners network broadcast of games in real time right on the DS from almost any seat in the stadium</li>
  <li>Order food from their seat</li>
  <li>Access player stats from all around the MLB</li>
  <li>Access up to date information on other MLB games in progress</li>
  <li>Compete against fellow fans in trivia and word games</li>
  </ul><br />
The downloadable software will be available for the 2007 season only, for now, but if fans give positive feedback it may see the light of day at other baseball stadiums across America.<br />
<br />
This isn't Nintendo's first foray into using the DS at special events, though; it began in Japan at the Kyoto theme park <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1666">Shigureden</a> with the "Ogura Hyakunin Isshu" exhibit and has more recently been seen in museums, where the DS is used as a <a href="http://www.newlaunches.com/archives/japanese_museum_spreads_knowlege_using_nintendo_ds.php">virtual tour guide</a>. Nintendo will likely continue these attempts as they further expand their audience.
