As seems to be the case with nearly all big first-party releases as of late, Nintendo has put up yet another Iwata Asks&#8212;this time for <i>Mario Kart Wii</i>.  Key points:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Producer Hideki Konno has been on every Mario Kart game except GameCube's <i>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</i></li>
  <li>"One of our overseas [subsidiaries]" responded to the Wheel with an immediate e-mail asking if the game could be made compatible with the GameCube controller&#8212;luckily for them, the game already had this option</li>
  <li>Using the Wii Wheel gives you a icon next to your rankings, to give incentive to use the controller over the classic offerings</li>
  <li>Konno has wanted to add bikes since Double Dash</li>
  <li>Rather than traditional leaderboards, the Kart rankings show you how many people around the world are playing on your level</li>
  <li>Online matches support drop-in, and waiting players can spectate on a match in progress</li>
  </ul><br />
