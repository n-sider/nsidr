<center><h3>Nintendo Dream System</h3></center>

<p>On what sort of adventures is the Nintendo Dream System going to take us?  We will undoubtedly be introduced to new frontiers and possibilities of visual gameplay.</p>

<p>The <i>2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo</i> will see the first official unveiling of the console. And with it, we hope to get to see the first games and their innovative utilization of the dual screens. Before that however, we'd like to make a few predictions as well as present a few of our own ideas of how the screens can be used.</p>

<p>In <b>Part I</b>, we'll share some of our ideas with you. Our ideas revolve mainly around the use of the two screens.  In those ideas, we've omitted rumored features such as a touch screen since it's still unknown how these will function technically.</p>

<p><b>Part II</b>, on the other hand, will be created exclusively by you.  So remember once you've completed reading this, send in your ideas and art representations to <a href="mailto:staff@n-sider.com">staff@n-sider.com</a>.  And since E3 is only over a week away, do not procrastinate and instead send them in <b>now</b> (Thursday, May 6, is the deadline).</p>

<p>We'll begin with something simple for our first idea and something every gamer should be familiar with - <i>Tetris</i>.</p>

<p>Each of the two screens will contain a <i>Tetris</i> board. Players will therefore have two boards to keep tabs on during gameplay. A simple click of the "right trigger button" (I made that up), will change the focus from one screen to another.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to properly place the <i>Tetris</i> pieces on BOTH screens. This will require a deeper sense of concentration and reflexes. Players must quickly set one piece into place on one screen, change the focus to the other screen and set that falling piece into place.</p>

<p>Players will have to toggle back and forth quickly to keep both screens from filling up with tetris blocks. If even one of the screens fills up, game is over.</p>

<p>In a game such as <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, when Snake shoots a remote controlled seeking missile, the first screen will stay on Snake, while the second screen will follow the missile. This would allow the player to both keep an eye on Snake - making sure no one approaches or sneaks up on him - and likewise allow you to easily maneuver the missile and seek out your target.</p>

<p>In a game such as <i>Splinter Cell</i>, a remote camera could be set in a static position and used to keep an eye on the enemy (using the second screen). The camera (second screen) could also be attached to an unsuspecting enemy's backpack.</p>

<p>Say you need to find information about a certain room - where guards are located, how many entrances/exits are available, etc. What you can do is attach a camera on the patrolling guard. As he makes his rounds, you can get a view of his surroundings (via the second DS screen) to aid you in your infiltration.</p>

<p>Depending on how the DS screens are aligned, Nintendo could make a mini-game in the next <i>Wario Ware</i> called "Poke Mario in the Eye Haha Fun Game". If the screens are aligned horizontally, one on the left and one on the right, the object for the game would be to avoid the fingers trying to poke Mario's eyes (left and right screen). If one of the eyes gets poked, that screen will go blank and then blurry, taking a few seconds to recover.</p>

<p>In a game such as <i>Resident Evil</i>, the first screen would of course be utilized for your character's view, whether you're Leon or Claire or whomever the series' next main character is decided to be.</p>

<p>The second view, meanwhile, would be used for your enemy's view. It would take away that element of surprise for you to be able to see your enemy's point of view, however as a consequence, it would add a new gameplay element. If the player realizes the enemy is getting close, he or she would need to choose to make a frantic rush for safety and/or hide in the nearby closet.</p>

<p>It would create a strategy of, <i>"Okay, I know where you're located. Now I need to be aware of all escape routes and hiding places in this room in case you decide to come after me."</i></p>

<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>The primary screen would show your ship and any surrounding enemies. You might also have a few status bars on screen (shields, missiles). The secondary screen would display a radar screen, sensor data, navigational data. This would be the twist, unlike most shooters, you will be able to navigate your ship to a certain extent.</p> 

<p>You will still be on a forward only flight path however, that would only change direction when you've met your waypoints. But you could change your 'grid' (left,right). This would allow you to avoid certain obstacles, but would sometimes require a trade off. e.g. You might avoid the mine field but you'll run into more enemies. This would basically force the player to keep tabs on the radar and navigation screen.</p> 

<p>Of course you couldn't fight enemies this way. So you would have to manage your time with each screen. Too much time watching the nav screen and you'll find yourself being torn to pieces by enemy fighters. Too much time on the main screen and you might find yourself having to navigate a mine/asteroid field or missing your target.</p>

<p>In addition, missions might include things like flying escort missions, patrols, search and destroy, surgical strike, etc...</p>

<p>In a game such as <i>Pikmin</i>, one screen will follow you as you collect Pikmin and various pieces of artifacts across the mysterious world.</p> 

<p>The second screen you can assign to a group of Pikmin, say Yellow, that you need to leave behind for a few seconds. You need to cross a river and since Yellow Pikmin can't swim, you leave them behind for just a moment. You assign the second screen to the Yellow Pikmin so you can keep an eye on them and make sure no bugs decide to sneak up and gobble them up while you're away.</p>

<p>After you've made it to the other side of the river, suddenly out of the corner of your eye on the second screen, you see a lizard creature named Osama Bin Laden approaching your precious Pikmin. You quickly run back across the rive, kick his butt and save the day.</p>

<p><i>Screen One:</i> Jade's adventuring<br>
<i>Screen Two:</i> Companion (e.g. Pey'J or Double H)</p>

<p>Instead of using primarily one screen to control Jade and simply an "action button" to make the companion do something, you could have one screen to position Jade, then on the other (via some sort of button press to switch control to the other character) you could then position Pey'J to go and do something important that Jade is relying on for her own progress.

<p>For mini-games like the races, Jade's screen would be used to race while the other screen would contain a "full screen" map showing your competitors.</p>

<p>For boss battles, a system would be in place that allowed the player to separate the characters and take on the same boss from different perspectives to give you maximum firepower from both characters.</p>

<p>Cut-scenes could utilize both screens as a combined big screen to heighten the dramatic effect. Or during news casts, one screen could show the newsreader with some imagery, and the other screen could show video footage of whatever story the newsreader is talking about (e.g. The DomZ attacks on someone, etc...)</p>

<p>This is probably the most gimmicky of ways the Nintendo DS will be used - that being the use of the second screen as either a map or a game menu. Lets hope it's not used too excessively and instead more original and unique techniques are utilized.</p>

<p>In an RPG such as <i>Golden Sun</i>, the second screen could interchange between being an inventory screen - in which you could manage your items and spells - to also being a larger overworld map of the area you currently occupy.</p>

<p>The primary screen would show the traditional view of player and battle field. While again the secondary screen could be used to access maps and your status/menu screens. However its main function would be to show you your allies status. Namely health, current MP, (assuming its not a turn based RPG) what they're doing (attacking, casting a spell, etc.) and anything special they might have.</p>

<p>Assuming the DS has two control sticks or a control stick and a D-Pad, you could order your computer team members around or request assistance from fellow human players that are playing on another linked (wireless or not doesn't matter) DS. This would be in the same vein as Rogue Squadron's wingman control system. <i>Up</i> = Attack, <i>Left</i> = Magic Attack, <i>Right</i> = Heal/Protect, and <i>Down</i> = Regroup.</p>

<b><font size="3">Rear-view Mirror DS</font></b><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>Say we're playing Mario Kart: Double Dash!! Part II!!. I need to keep an eye on my behind to make sure no green or red shells are coming up from behind in an attempt to remove me from my first place position.</p>

<p>The first screen I use to see the road in front of me, while the second screen acts as a rear-view mirror. Suddenly I see a red shell coming at 30 mph at my rear. I quickly yell expletives, dodge it and retain my position..</p>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">Cinematic DS</font></b><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>Basically the second screen would serve as a media projector - with cinemas of the camera panning in or out, birds flying, a quick camera ascension up the valley of a canyon - any sort of aerial view, zoom in, zoom out. Overall, add that Hollywood look to it with something artistic and cinematic.</p>

<p>For example, a conversation between two people would be seen as one person on one screen, the second person on the other screen. The DS would provide a new way of presenting cut-scenes and also be able to have cut-scenes in the game <i>without stopping actual gameplay</i>. For example, you're still playing on one screen while a short cutscene plays on the other.</p>
