It's been a rough weekend for those craving news on <i>Excitebots: Trick Racing</i>.  We had the original somewhat <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendo-announces-games-forgets-to-mention-details">information-free announcement</a> last week, of course; then the <i>shock and awe</i> unleashed by <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/game_boxart/boxart-6390-1.jpg">the leaked boxart</a>&mdash;confirming to at least some of the less-faithful that Nintendo was taking their newborn series down the "casual" crapper.<br />

<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3845-1.jpg" width="178" height="306" class="image_styled" /></div><i>Nintendo Power</i> to the rescue.<br />
<br />
They've updated their <a href="http://www.nintendopower.com/">teaser site</a> with first pages of several of their new features, including one for <i>Excitebots</i>, featuring some rather small but interesting-looking screenshots and a good deal of text.  (Click the "Off the Beaten Track" link to see for yourself.)<br />
<br />
The short story is that <i>Excitebots</i> really did start out as <i>Excite Truck 2</i>, but to hear the developers (yes, it's Monster Games again!) tell it, they were setting out to amp up everything that made <i>Excite Truck</i> <i>Excite Truck</i> and found that the trucks themselves simply didn't match up to their wild new world all that well.  Thus, they created the 'bots, which take the form of insects and animals&mdash;and you can even transform them with a power-up to make them walk on two legs.  The pictures included here are of a new trick, the "red bar", which has you matching your 'bot's rotations with the Wii Remote to earn stars&mdash;ten are pictured, implying tricks can be taken to new levels over <i>ET</i>'s five.<br />
<br />
I have to say, I haven't really been this amped up over tiny screenshots in <i>ages</i>.  From what little we've seen, it sounds like <i>Excitebots</i> is going to deliver just like <i>Excite Truck</i> before it did.  I can't wait.<br />

<b>UPDATE:</b> Wii-DS just posted <a href="http://wiids.nl/article.php?id=29009">exclusive screenshots.</a>
