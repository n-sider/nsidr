German magazine <i>Man!ac</i> has revealed two Wii games being published by THQ. The first is a sequel to an already established series, <i>Destroy All Humans 3</i>, and will also be released on the PS2, PS3, PSP, and 360. The second is <i>De Blob</i> which is a Wii exclusive.<br />
<br />
Not too much is known about Destroy All Humans 3, but it will likely follow the same pattern as the previous games in the series and add its own brand of Wii controls.<br />
<br />
De Blob, on the other hand, is a little more abundant in details. The game is based on a German student project of the <a href="http://www.fun-motion.com/physics-games/de-blob/">same name</a>. In the game, players control a blob of paint and roll around to paint the city. Collecting different colored NPCs will change the color of the blob as well as make it grow. The goal of the game is to paint the entire city, collecting coins along the way.<br />
<br />
It is unknown in what ways the Wii version of De Blob will change the game. The original game was designed with a trackball in mind, but obviously a change in controls can be expected.<br />
<br />
Destroy All Humans 3 is due for release late this year, and De Blob will is set for a 2008 release.
