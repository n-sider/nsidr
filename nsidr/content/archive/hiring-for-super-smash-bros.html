Word is coming down the grapevine that Nintendo and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/hal-laboratory-company-profile">HAL Laboratory</a> are hiring additional programmers and designers for the next iteration in the <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> series for Project Revolution.  The main positions looking to be filled include:<br>

<ul>
<li>Game Programmer
<li>3D Character Designer/Modeler
<li>3D Character Animation
<li>3D Map Designer
  </ul>

Nintendo is only contracting these employees for this particular game. The employment may be terminated after the development is complete.  This may mean Nintendo is trying to get the game out the door sooner or simply that the game itself has more depth to it and requires the extra help.

<br><br>You might recall we reported in November that former director and long-time HAL Laboratory employee <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1544">Masahiro Sakurai</a> would return to direct the next installment in the Smash Bros. series.  Having been Nintendo's best-selling title this generation, it appears Nintendo is doing all it can to assure the sequel surpasses the orginal.  It will especially be interesting to see the length of the final roster of people working on the game.
