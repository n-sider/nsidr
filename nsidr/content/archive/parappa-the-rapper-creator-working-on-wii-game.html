NanaOn-Sha head Masaya Matsuura is <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=25008">tossing around the idea</a> of a title for Wii, as he told GamesIndustry.biz's Ellie Gibson at the Nordic Game conference.<br />
<br />
Matsuura's game is in the planning stages, and will be "a very casual, one-button game"&mdash;something he hopes work will officially begin on "soon, maybe".  When it comes to Wii, he appears quite worried about player fatigue: "...it's very hard sometimes. Because can you keep shaking the controller for hours?<br />
<br />
"Players can't spend a long time on gameplay, so this can be tough. So I respect Nintendo's activities, but for software designers like us, it's very hard."
