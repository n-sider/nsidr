A trailer for <i>LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga</i> was recently released on the game's <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legostarwarssaga/">official website</a>. The trailer comes shortly after the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2795">game's announcement</a> nearly a week ago.<br />
<br />
Scenes from each of the six Star Wars movies are shown, featuring the trademark humor and action of the LEGO Star Wars franchise. Likewise, the game continues the graphical style of the previous games with everything taking a LEGO block-like appearance. A variety of characters are shown, including Jar Jar Binks, a younger Obi Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul, who later demonstrates how characters across the series can interchange parts by donning Princess Leia's infamous slave girl bikini. Of course, many other combinations exist, since this is the first time all the characters throughout the Star Wars series have shared the same screen.<br />
<br />
The trailer also shows many of the game's features. While the gameplay remains relatively the same from LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy, everything has been upgraded. There are more levels to play that are revamped from the previous games, and new challenges, such as Luke shooting down TIE Fighters from a base. A new Jedi move is also revealed in the trailer, with a character flipping a Stormtrooper's helmet around so he can't see.<br />
<br />
The LucasArts title will be released this fall.
