<p>Several Pokmon episodes have been released for the Game Boy Advance as part of Majesco's line of Game Boy Advance Video series which sell for an MSRP of $19.99 each.  These include "Playing with Fire!" and "Johto Photo Finish" on one video pak and "A Hot Water Bottle" and "For Ho-Oh The Bells Toll!" on another.</p>

<p>The video paks look identical to Game Boy Advance game paks, fitting into the same slot. The plus button fast forwards or rewinds through the video, while the right and left shoulder buttons skip entire scenes. The start button pauses the action, while the select button returns to the main menu. The A and B buttons adjust the brightness.</p>
