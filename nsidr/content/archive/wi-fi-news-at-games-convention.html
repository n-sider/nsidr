<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick</a>, Nintendo of Europe's director of sales and marketing, spoke at the Games Convention regarding Nintendo's upcoming Wi-Fi services.  In 2000, Merrick began working closely with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata on a network/Internet game strategy for Nintendo.  Although nothing tangible ever came of this, Merrick noted that the company has been working with network gaming for several decades (more on Nintendo's online history can be read <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendonline">here</a>.)

He said Nintendo has chosen to launch a worldwide network now because the technology, experience as well as several other factors are finally prepared.  Nintendo believes the future is in Wi-Fi gaming and that there are three specific factors that will make it successful.  

<ol>
<li>"Ease of use. No usernames. No passwords. No IP addresses. No URLs. No unintelligible technobabble. Just gaming." 
<br>
<li>"...a fun and comfortable environment for everyone. Hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike. With Nintendo wi-fi you can choose to play only with your friends. Or, if you choose, you can find people based on skill level."
<br>
<li>"Cost. Nintendo won't be charging any subscription service to play our wi-fi games. We believe that wi-fi gaming should be a natural extension of the game. Not a new way to extract money from the gamers."
</ol> 

Nintendo further announced that it will be installing several hot spots around Europe, with game retailers likely being one destination.  Nintendo's vision is the freedom to enjoy wi-fi multiplayer gaming anywhere.
