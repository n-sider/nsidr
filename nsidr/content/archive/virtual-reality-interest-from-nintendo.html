Virtual reality makes <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4580332.stm">headlines</a> once again.  A Bellevue, WA-based company called <a href="http://www.3dvisor.com/">eMagin</a> has created a device described as a "3D visor that uses two micro displays to create a stereo vision of a game."  The headset is said to feature gyroscopes that let players look around current games by moving the head from side to side.  The device is said to work with most PC games as well as the recently launched Microsoft Xbox 360.<br><br>

"Nintendo has even purchased some," eMagin's Bruce Ridley told BBC News.<br><br>

Before someone goes and proclaims this as something related to Project Revolution, realize eMagin has been selling the headset from its website since July for around $900.
