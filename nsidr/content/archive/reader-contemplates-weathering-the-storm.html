<blockquote><hr></blockquote><font size="2">

In the days of the NES Nintendo appeared to be unstoppable. It was the pioneer, the explorer, and the conqueror. It had forged a grand empire and was the absolute ruler of it's domain. But somewhere along it's journey Nintendo became complacent and forgot that no company is unstoppable, nothing is untouchable. It's success still continued for a good while beyond the SNES era and even into the time of the N64, but nothing lasts forever and the time of change was near.
<br><br>
The nature of the videogames industry is that it always finds a way to show it's true power to those that think they are better than it or that they can somehow control and dominate it, and this is exactly what happened to Nintendo.
<br><br>
Just as it seemed Nintendo could only go up and onward a storm was sent it's way in the form of Sony Computer Entertainment, to remind Nintendo that it was not all powerful, it could be touched, and it was vulnerable. And due to it's overconfidence, without even realising it had made any wrong turns, Nintendo had lost its way and wandered strait into the heart of the tornado.
<br><br>
The world of videogames that Nintendo knew was thrown into chaos, everything and the kitchen sink was dragged up into the whirlwind, and in the mix the industry was pulled and twisted in new directions, and Nintendo seemed like it was knocked for six, unable to cope with the situation.
<br><br>
Some explorers were lost along the way, such as Sega, bashed and thrown so hard by the storm that it was ripped into a shadow of it's former self.
<br><br>
With the launch of the GC it appeared as if Nintendo was truly lost too, taking one blind turn after another, trying to push against the storm and stubbornly show that it was immune to its effects, and that it was able to withstand it's might.
<br><br>
But the storm raged on without a concern for Nintendo's arrogance and ripped at the company, tearing at its core, throwing it in all directions. And under such force even the mighty Nintendo buckled. In the end Nintendo had to admit that it was pointless to battle against such power. It was better to study it, learn from it, and from this eventually find a way to make it through and overcome the momentum of the cyclone.
<br><br>
The storm however grew more powerful and gathered more momentum and along the way picked up more debris in the form of the Xbox and Microsoft and it grew in power until it seemed nothing could stop it, not even Nintendo.
<br><br>
But just as before, nothing is unstoppable, nothing is untouchable, and the storm began to slow and the destruction in its wake was reduced as all the bits and pieces and debris it had picked up had started to slow it down and dissipate it's energy. Nintendo felt this and knew its time for action was now.
<br><br>
Like a true adventurer, pioneer and conqueror, Nintendo forged onwards, moving against the immense force of the storm, one step at a time, finding it's footing again, and it began to understand the nature of the beast and embrace it. It learned that going head to head with it may not be the best solution and may not give the desired result and outcome. And it changed from fighting that which cannot be stopped to learning how to use its energy and momentum for it's own advantage and gain. Nintendo learned to carry itself on the wind of the hurricane using minimal effort all the while the hurricane raged on expunging massive amounts of energy and resources to keep itself rolling and turning.
<br><br>
For years Nintendo weathered the storm, and somehow managed to make its way through to the other side, battered and torn, but all the stronger and wiser for it. Lessons and humility have been learned, and now it is time to begin again, with a new vision and goal, a redrawn map, and a desire to show that it is still a company that should never be underestimated and a force to be reckoned with, but one that knows where it came from, where it is, and where it is going, and one that has a contingency plan just in case the unforeseen should happen again.
<br><br>
As the dust settles sure there will be a period of confusion and chaos and all the rubble will have to be cleared for the reconstruction and rebuilding to begin, but this time the foundations will be made stronger and more reliable, the buildings placed on top will be superior and far more future proof, and the universal burning red Nintendo logo will be emblazoned above every door to let the world know that the pioneers will begin a new journey and carve a new path and destiny, and it begins now.
<br><br>
Nintendo is back and appears to be all the better for it's ordeal. And it is more true today than ever that Nintendoes what no one else does.  Understand and respect the power of videogames in their own right and their potential to be the dominant form of entertainment of the 21st century.
<br><br>
A new era is coming and a war beyond any before awaits those who choose the path of videogames, and if you trust anything it has to say, then at least this time Nintendo seems fully prepared for whatever that future battle may have in store.
<br><br>
The future is what you make it!
