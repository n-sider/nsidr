<p>CV&G spoke with Sega's <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> creator Toshihiro Nagoshi.  Here's an excerpt below:</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p>What are you thoughts on Sony's PlayStation Portable and the Nintendo DS?</p>

<p>Nagoshi: Well, they're both different concepts and [have different] target audiences. Nintendo is targeting young children all the way through to adults, whereas Sony's PSP is geared more toward teenagers.</p>

<p>Are you planning on developing titles for both systems?</p>

<p>Nagoshi: I'm thinking about it.</p>

<p>Is anything being worked on right now?</p>

<p>Nagoshi: No comment.</p>

<p>We're huge fans of Monkey Ball. Can you tell us anything about the next Monkey Ball game?</p>

<p>Nagoshi: We do realise that this is a popular game so certainly we've been working on the next version but I can't comment on that at this time.</p>
