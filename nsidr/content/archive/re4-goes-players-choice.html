<p>Having sold over 620,000 copies in the US, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=956"><i>Resident Evil 4</i></a> is now the latest title to <ahref="http://cube.ign.com/articles/684/684675p1.html">go Player's Choice</a>, according to an IGN story.</p>

<p><i>Resident Evil 4</i> has probably been the GameCube's most acclaimed 2005 title in a year where the previously-purple box didn't see much love from other corners, pulling down a <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/535840.asp">96% average rating</a> from GameRankings based on its consistently high reviews.</p>

<p>A game must sell 450,000 copies to qualify for the Player's Choice designation, which has historically only been offered on Nintendo's home consoles, and not its portable systems.</p>
