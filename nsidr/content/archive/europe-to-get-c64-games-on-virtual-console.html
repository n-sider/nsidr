Nintendo of Europe has announced that Commodore 64 games are destined for the Virtual Console service in that territory.<br />
<br />
Games like <i>Uridium</i> and <i>International Karate</i> have been confirmed so far, and titles will sell for 500 Wii Points apiece&#8212;the same price point as most NES games.  At press time, this apparently ludicrously high price point has the Internets aflame.<br />
