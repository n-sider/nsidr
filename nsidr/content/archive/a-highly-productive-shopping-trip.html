While out and about yesterday, I decided it was high time I catch up on a few of the more awesome DS titles that had been released in the past few months.  My poor DS... so neglected.  Well, no longer!<br />
<br />
I've been highly desirous of <i>Soul Bubbles</i> for many months now, and the game now in my hands has not disappointed.  It's absolutely <i>beautiful</i>, both aurally and visually&#8212;don't let the ugly box art fool you.  Its feel, its control, is right up there with the best of the DS titles.  But it also seems to have that indefinable quality that shows there's the hand of masterful design at work.  Admittedly, I've only been through six levels thus far, including those of the tutorial.  But every step of the way, I've been enjoying new elements, building on skills I've picked up, and loving every minute of it.<br />

<i>Bangai-O Spirits</i> is one I had an eye on but didn't necessarily put on my must-have list until the recommendations came pouring in.  I'll say right now, though, it's making me feel totally weak.  I felt proud to have cleared the <i>tutorial</i>.  Time will tell if it ends up being frustratingly difficult or on the tippy-top of pleasantly challenging, but either way, this is clearly a high-quality crafted title.<br />
<br />
Finally, one of the few real Nintendo games I've bought in what seems like ages: <i>Kirby Super Star Ultra</i>.  I never played the original <i>Kirby Super Star</i>, so this was my first time at this particular game collection.  Playing it reminds me of the "Nintendo difference," especially when I hold it up to the mediocre <i>Wario Land: Shake It!</i> or the oft-annoying <i>Yoshi's Island DS</i> that I was so excited about years ago and never ended up completing&#8212;both outsourced.  Looking forward to finishing it, and maybe someday trying out co-op (multi-card, sigh.)  And hey, how can I resist&#8212;especially after the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/angry-kirby-syndrome">long dark angry-Kirby period</a>&#8212;the <i>most awesome</i> Kirby cover NOA has <i>ever</i> put out?
