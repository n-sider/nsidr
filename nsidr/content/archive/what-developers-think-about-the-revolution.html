Gamasutra has posted letters received from readers involved in software and other development.  The question posed was <i>"Now that Nintendo has revealed details of the controller for its Revolution next-gen console, do you think this bold move is beneficial for Nintendo itself, third-party developers, and the industry in general?"</i>.  The response was surprisingly almost unanimously positive.  You can check out the responses from developers such as EA and more <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050928/hong_01.shtml">here</a>.  An excerpt is below:

<blockquote><font size="2">Alex Neuse, Activision said, "While I too was surprised when I first saw the controller, I do believe that the move is beneficial for Nintendo, 3rd parties, and the industry. While I can't say whether anyone will benefit financially, I believe that the current state of the industry could use some innovation like Nintendo is offering with this new controller. Nintendo is going out on a limb to offer the industry a tool that can potentially revolutionize games. Whether 3rd parties support this move or not is really up to them. I would leave you with this thought though: When Nintendo created the gamepad it was adopted as the norm; when they created the analog stick it was adopted as the norm; when they created rumble it was adopted as the norm. Their track record is strong. I hope that this new controller allows developers to offer gamers new and unique ways to interface with the medium."
