<p>On an otherwise slow news day, I was able to discover this fascinating little item. Starting this weekend, Nintendo is launching an ad campaign to promote public awareness on the Nintendo DS' Wi-Fi capability. The trailer itself is a minute long and is titled "The Sad, Agonizing Tale of Bhuvan Ganguly." </p>

<p>For all interested, you may view the <a href="http://media.ds.ign.com/articles/637/637723/vids_1.html">trailer</a> over at IGN.</p>
