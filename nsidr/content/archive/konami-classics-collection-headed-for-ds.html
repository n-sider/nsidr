Konami hasn't forgotten the DS this weekend: they're also <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=156736">bringing a collection</a> of 15 classic Konami games to the platform.<br />
<br />
<i>Konami Arcade Classics</i> is a bit nebulous at this point, but we do know that it will include shooter <i>Gradius</i>, other shooter <i>Time Pilot</i>, and beat-em-up <i>Yie-Ar Kung Fu</i>.  Both original-styled ports and remixed versions will be part of the title.<br />
<br />
The collection is slated to drop this fall.
