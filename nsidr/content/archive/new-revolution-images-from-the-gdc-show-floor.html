<p><a href="http://www.revolutionreport.com/articles/read/352">Revolution Report</a> has hit the floor at the Game Developers Conference to snap some photos of Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed Revolution.  The unit as well as the controller are on display within a glass case in Nintendo's booth.  The hardware appears to be somewhat thicker than that first shown at the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">2005 E3 Expo</a>.  In addition, the case lacks the "Revolution" logo and instead sports a simple Nintendo decal.  Hit the link to see the images yourself.</p>
