<p>When <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> didn't appear on Nintendo Europe's Q1 radar, rumors surfaced that the game had been moved to Nintendo's next-generation console, code-named Revolution.</p>

<p>Why the absence of Twilight Princess on the Q1 radar would be cause for such a rumor in the first place is entirely unknown to this reporter, since Nintendo clearly said the game had been delayed to their next fiscal year, which means Q2 at the absolute earliest -- but of course, gaming rumors defy reason as a matter of course.  Nonetheless, the rumor got whipped up so quickly and fervently that Nintendo UK's PR manager <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=61584">confirmed to Eurogamer</a> the game was still on-track for a GameCube release and had <em>not</em> been moved to Revolution.</p>

<p>Twilight Princess was originally slated for a release this holiday season, but was delayed to FY 2006 in the interests of making sure the game was absolutely complete and, in the words of the always-humble Nintendo PR folks, "to add some incredible new elements" to the game.</p>
