Jones Soda said it has partnered with Nintendo of America to hold an "under-the-cap promotion sweepstakes". The promotion will occur August 1, 2005 through October 31, 2005 in the United States and Western Canada. Jones has created limited edition bottle labels with an image of Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo DS title, Metroid Prime Hunters. The limited edition labels are on three Jones Soda flavors including Blue Bubblegum, Green Apple and Fufu Berry. You must collect five Jones Soda bottle caps with letters that spell out J.O.N.E.S. and submit the caps for a chance to win the Grand Prize or the First Prize. Individuals will also have an opportunity to win instant prizes if they find the "instant win" caps.

There will be one Grand Prize winner who will receive a flat screen TV, a Nintendo GameCube, two Nintendo DS handhelds, three Nintendo GameCube games, two Nintendo DS video games as well as a chance to win $25,000 in cash. There will also be 75 first prize winners who will each win a Nintendo DS handheld. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.jonessoda.com">jonessoda.com</a>.
