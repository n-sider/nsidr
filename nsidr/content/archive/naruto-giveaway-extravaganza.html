Naruto, the knuckleheaded ninja-in-training, has been a mainstay in Japan for years now.  The Shonen Jump manga spawned the anime, which in turn spawned no fewer than four games a piece on the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance.  The phenomenon has only recently crossed the Pacific, however, with Tomy localizing the first editions in the now-long-standing GCN and GBA series.  Naruto: Clash of Ninja for the GameCube is a 3D fighting game based on the first couple arcs in the anime, and is mirrored by Naruto: Ninja Council, a 2D action platformer, on the Game Boy Advance.<br><br>

So what say we give away a copy of each, hm?<br><br>

Naruto: Ninja Council will be given away via a standard random-draw sweepstakes.  Send us an email via the links below, and you'll get one entry in the drawing.  If you want to increase your chances, though, take a peek at our <a href="/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1915">E3 2006 DVD Preorders</a>.  Everyone who preorders a DVD will get an additional THREE entries in the drawing.  Shameless self-promotion?  Believe it!<br><br>

For Naruto: Clash of Ninja, we're gonna make you work for it.  Via the links below, we want you to send us a lovingly composed Naruto Haiku.  What's a haiku, you ask?  Discounting the history and thematic requirements, it can be boiled down to a three-line syllabically-rigid piece of poetry.  For example:<br><br>

<div style="padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 140px; border-left: 1px solid #808080;">
Orochimaru.<br>
Villianous Konoha scourge?<br>
Or cross-dressing tart?
</div><br>

You get the idea.  Three lines, the first and last each having 5 syllables, and the middle having 7.  5-7-5.  The entry we find most clever, unique, or generally well-written will win the GameCube fighter.  You can feel free to enter both contests, but the winner of the GameCube game will be disqualified from winning the GBA one.<br><br>

Entries will be accepted until April 31st, at which point the winners will be determined.  Good luck, and happy haikuing!<br />
