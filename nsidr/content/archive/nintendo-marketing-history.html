<br />
<b>1990</b><br />
<br />
North America: Earthbound for the Nintendo Entertainment System was scheduled to release this year.  Nintendo of America however was hesitant to release the title.  They didn't feel it fit into the product mix that the market was asking for and/or expecting.  One such excuse that has been given is that RPGs were not yet exceptionally popular to the North American gaming crowd.  This was further compounded by Nintendo's marketing department shifting focus to the preparation of the Super Nintendo marketing campaign for 1991.  Inevitably, Earthbound missed it's window to launch thereby completely losing out on a future North American release.<br />
<br />
Japan: Nintendo Japan released the Game Boy along with flagship titles Super Mario Land, Alleyway and Baseball.
