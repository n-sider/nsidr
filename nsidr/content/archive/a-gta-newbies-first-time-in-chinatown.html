I've never played a <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> game before <i>Chinatown Wars</i>.  I suppose this is largely because the theme didn't particularly appeal to me, though I enjoyed taking the controller off a cousin once to beat up some random old ladies in a subway.  But then, a perfect storm started to roll in.  Friends were getting into <i>GTA IV</i>, rather enjoying it, and telling me why.  <i>Chinatown</i> arrived on DS, which made it both easy to hide from kids and cheaper to get into.  It was garnering high and rarely-qualified praise, and not just from the usual Exclusive First Review crowd, but from average people whose opinions I could believe.  I decided I found its comic-book style rather appealing.  I had made up my mind I'd try it out next time I needed a new game to play... and then, suddenly, it was $20 at Best Buy.  I jumped in.<br />

I was so hooked it wasn't funny.  <i>Chinatown</i>'s primary method of evading wanted stars&mdash;getting cop cars to crash, which I'm told is unique in the series&mdash;made it <i>fun</i> to get busted.<br />
<br />
I loved nearly everything about the game for the weeks I was into it, with the possible exception of the awkward-to-use projectile-throwing controls.  I didn't really "get to know the town" like some tend to like to do; I turned on the feature to draw GPS arrows on the street and just went careening around as fast as I could.  I'd still find random distractions on the way, like new drug dealers, stunt jumps, random missions, or rampages (this game <i>really</i> shines when there's tons of carnage going on at once); tracking these down always paid off.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that I feel this game deserves its high review scores, and doesn't deserve its rumored low sales.  It doesn't try to be overwrought in the slightest; it doesn't take itself seriously at all.  It's just pure, unadulterated fun and definitely one of the best titles in the DS' already pretty unquestionably awesome library.
