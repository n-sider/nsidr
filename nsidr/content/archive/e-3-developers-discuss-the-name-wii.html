<p><a href="http://wii.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=6684">AdvancedMN</a> has caught up with several developers to hear their opinion on the recently announced name of Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed Revolution.  Those questioned seem fairly optimistic about the name Wii.</p>

"Back before the launch of the Playstation, when we were working with SCEA, we tried to tell the powers that be that the name Playstation was too juvenile and child like for the American market - Boy were we wrong.  Nintendo has created hardware that will change the way we play and think about games. It is only appropriate that the name makes us think, wonder, and discuss as well - No matter what, you will not forget the name."

"Just like everything else Wii related, the name caught me off guard, and I think I had the same initial reaction as everyone else. When the controller was shown, a slight sinking feeling. when the specs were shown, a slight sinking feeling. when the name was revealed, a slight sinking feeling. So why am I supporting Wii after all those sinking feelings? Because that only lasts until we understand the reasoning behind it."

"Names do have an effect on your sales and sometimes they don't. It depends on the marketing message that is projected and how it is projected and distributed with your name. Nintendo has one of the top 5 game industry marketing teams (in my opinion) and I don't think they are going to do anything that will hurt their profits and goals of bringing in new gamers to our industry."
