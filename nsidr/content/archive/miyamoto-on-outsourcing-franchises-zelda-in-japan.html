An EW.com interview with Director and GM of Nintendo EAD Shigeru Miyamoto has some interesting tidbits on his feelings about outsourcing key Nintendo franchises, as Nintendo has been doing quite a bit in the past several years, as well as the lackluster performance of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> (which series head Eiji Aonuma told GDC crowds was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2673">created for American audiences</a>) in Japan.  Here are a few choice quotes:<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Shigeru Miyamoto</span>I could make <i>Halo</i>. It's not that I couldn't design that game. It's just that I choose not to. One thing about my game design is that I never try to look for what people want and then try to make that game design. I always try to create new experiences that are fun to play... When I show a game to people I don't ask their opinion or give them a survey. I just watch their eyes and their face while they play. Do they smile? Do they look frustrated? So I guess I do test my games&mdash;but it isn't very scientific.</div></div><br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Shigeru Miyamoto</span>In the past we've worked with some outside development houses on titles like F-Zero and Starfox&mdash;and let me just say that we were disappointed with the results. Consumers got very excited about the idea of those games, but the games themselves did not deliver.</div></div><br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Shigeru Miyamoto</span>...Zelda: Twilight Princess is not doing very well at all in Japan. It is very disappointing... I think a lot of people who bought the Wii [in Japan] are not necessarily the types of people who are interested in playing that kind of game. And a lot of the people who would want to play it can't find a Wii! But mostly, I think it's that there are fewer and fewer people who are interested in playing a big role-playing game like Zelda.</div></div><br />
