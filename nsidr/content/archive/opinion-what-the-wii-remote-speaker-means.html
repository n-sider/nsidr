"The speaker on the controller is brilliant. Let's say you're playing that Tennis game on Wii. Not only will you have rumble to tell you where in the air your controller is striking the "ball," but you'll also have the crackling pop!, letting you know precisely when to stop swinging and to prepare for the next volley. Having the sound appear precisely in the air where it would be in the game is something that a surround sound system, no matter how good, could ever achieve. The only big question that remains is the quality of sound on the controller's speaker."
