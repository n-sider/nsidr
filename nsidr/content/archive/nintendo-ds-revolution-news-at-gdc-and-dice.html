<p>Nintendo will have two additional presenters at GDC.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=17">Katsuya Eguchi</a> will be speaking about the differences between handheld and console development in his speech titled "Is that a Franchise in Your Pocket? An Animal Crossing: Wild World Case Study" on March 23. Meanwhile, Takao Ohara will discuss the technological challenges faced in the implementation of Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection in his speech "The Zen of Wi-Fi: A Postmortem of the Wireless Features of Nintendo DS" on March 24.</p>

<p>Don't forget Nintendo also has two other opportunities to announce info before March.  Nintendo of America's executive vice president of marketing, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>, will be speaking at <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1690">DICE</a>  on February 9.  Reggie will likely be reiterating Nintendo's strategy as the company moves into the next-generation with Nintendo DS and Nintendo Revolution.  His speech is entitled "Expanding the Market for Interactive Entertainment."<br><br>

Beyond this, Nintendo will also be holding a press conference February 15 in Tokyo to discuss its recently unveiled Nintendo DS Lite.  Nintendo is expected to also highlight for press and retailers the unit's software line-up in 2006.<br><br>

It's going to be a busy year, that's for sure.  Hope you all stick with us as we travel the fields of Hyrule, wave our magical wands, and view gaming through a double doorway.
