<p>Nintendo has partnered with <a href="http://www.shigureden.com/">Shigureden</a>, a theme park located in <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n09/shigureden/index.html">Kyoto, Japan,</a> to promote the "Ogura Hundred Poems By Famed 100 Poets" literature through an interactive exhibit.  The floor of the exhibit features illuminated pictures related to the poems. Attendees can use a buttonless-Nintendo DS handheld to view and interact with information and images as they walk around the exhibit.</p>

<p>In September 2004, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=382">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a>, Nintendo senior advisor and former president of Nintendo Co., Ltd., suggested the company consider production of movie animation. Yamauchi's reasoning was that he felt making games is similar to movie making.  Nintendo's board of directors agreed to pursue the idea.  Yamauchi had said that he would like the first film to cover a Japanese poet who appears in "Ogura Hyakunin Isshu," an ancient anthology of 100 poems by 100 different poets written in the 7th and 13th centuries. In November 2003, Yamauchi became the president and chief financial sponsor of Ogura Hyakunin Isshu Project foundation, a group dedicated to promoting and preserving the "Ogura Hyakunin Isshu".</p>
