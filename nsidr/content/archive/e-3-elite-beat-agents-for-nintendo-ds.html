<li>In a jam? Well, all these guys DO is jam! Prepare to rock as these beat masters use their
groovy moves to save the day.
<li>As the music plays, players tap the screen, trace rhythmic patterns and keep the
beat as the story unfolds on the top screen.
<li>Every scene is accompanied by rump-shaking tunes, but players have to keep the
Elite Beat Agents grooving. The worse players do, the worse the story might end
up.
<li>Rhythm games have come and gone, but no one has ever seen anything like the
Elite Beat Agents. Whether they're helping a lost dog find its way home or
helping a babysitter charm a hunky football player, no crisis is too weird.
Game storyline: The public knows of government agencies like the FBI and CIA, but
little is known of this super-secret agency. Code-named "Elite Beat Agents," these men
in black are heroes' heroes and the coolest group of guys this world has ever known. Of
course, according to official records, they do not exist.
