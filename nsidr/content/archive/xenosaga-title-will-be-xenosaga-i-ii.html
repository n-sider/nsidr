<p>We have known that Namco has had a Xenosaga title for DS in the works for some time, but today <a href="http://ds.1up.com/">1UP</a> is reporting that the title is a port of the previously-released Xenosaga I and II, completely converted to 2-D.</p>

<p>Several FMV cutscenes from the original games will be included in the title, though many will be adapted to the game's 2-D engine.  The battle engine appears to be primarily based on Xenosaga I's.</p>
