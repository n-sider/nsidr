Got any thoughts on what HAL Laboratory's second GCN game could be? I am thinking SSB:M sequal or Earthbound. 
</b><br>
<i>-The Great Saiyaman</i>

<p><b>Anthony P:</b> HAL could be up to anything at the moment but it's very possible that a Super Smash Bros. Melee threequel is in the works due to the sequels generous earnings. However, let's not forget that HAL are still very much in love with their little, pink, sucker Kirby. Maybe HAL will throw out the Kirbster for some platforming goodness on the GameCube after they're done with <i>Kirby's Tilt and Tumble 2</i>? E3 is only a week and a bit away, I'm sure some answers will crop up there.


<p><b>Jason:</b> As much as I would love to agree with Anthony here, I'm just going to have to disagree on the E3 thing.  I really doubt we will see anything from HAL at E3 this year simply because I don't see a project worth unveiling at the show.  If there is some large undisclosed game in development then Spaceworld might be a better place to show off the goods.  I'm not saying that I would put money on that forecast but rather that I don't personally see it happening.  As for their next job, I second the notion that Kirby could be in the cards.

whats going on with square and nintendo? are we gonna see ff7 on the cube or what? What ever happend to sega and nintendo makeing a game with the sonic and mario characters was it not suppose to be an rpg or something please help me by answering this question u guys rule nintendo forever
</b><br>
<i>-Kemar</i>

<p><b>Anthony P:</b> 1). Final Fantasy 7 for the GameCube doesn't seem all that likely considering Nintendo's stance on new and invigorating software. However, Nintendo have affirmed in many interviews that there is a Final Fantasy title in development for the GameCube and that it will interact with a GBA Final Fantasy as well. 2). The Sega and Nintendo thing was a rumour (prayer?) originating from an interview where Miyamoto expressed his keeness to work with Yuji Naka. Since then there's not been much information on that collaberation to chew on the rumour went into hiding. That said, with Miyamoto running around striking key deals for "duets" with high profile developers, anything is possible. I'm looking at you again E3...

<p><b>Jason:</b> Once again, I still don't think E3 will hold the answers Anthony.  Square has been increasingly silent about the whole GameCube/GBA deal, and I'm pretty sure that E3 will have little to no information regarding such projects.  I do have to side with you however about the FF7 on GameCube thing.  I really don't see the game coming to GameCube at all but I do expect <i>a</i> Final Fantasy of some sort.  Also, Sonic and Mario might just be making an outing together.  If history is any guide, then Miyamoto has left more than enough hints about such an event.  Who knows though, these days the world is completely topsy turvy.  Starfox with Namco, Sega developing for GameCube, Squaresoft with Nintendo, Biohazard exclusive, rare departure rumors, etc.  I don't know what to think next.

will ther be a Tekken 4 for game cube
</b><br>
<i>-Daniel</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> Last I checked, Sony had it exclusive to the PS2 for an undisclosed amount of time. Of course, that doesn't mean that it couldn't come to the GameCube at some point.

<p><b>Anthony P:</b>As Brenden said, Sony were quick to tie that big name fighter up for as long as they could. Don't fret though, another Namco fighter, widely regarded as the better of the two, will be heading Cube side in the form of Soul Caliber 2. The downside is that it'll be here in the first quarter of... 2003. 

<p><b>Josh:</b> Tekken 4 is a PS2 exclusive, but if Namco really wanted to, they could make a few minor changes and release it on the GameCube as a "Remix" or something to that effect; such a game would not violate the exclusivity contract with Sony. Like Anthony, however, I'll just point you to Soul Caliber 2; most gamers agree that it is the superior series.

<hr><b>
Hey guys,
I was reading how the N-Sider website was non-profit, and I got an idea. Assuming you guys are going to E3, why don't you tape the event and sell it for an affordable price (a la Planet GameCube)? There is a fairly large demand for these tapes and DVDs, and it would no doubt allow you to do more things with your site.
</b><br>
<i>-Josh</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> Those kinds of things would require money to begin with anyway. On top of that, we're at E3 to cover video games... not video tape us doing stupid stuff. Those stories are saved for the <a href="http://shadow.ds98.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi">forums</a>.

<p><b>Jason:</b> Funny you mention that.  We actually planned to do such a thing for last year's show.  It ended up being that a) none of us had the equipment and b) we were far too busy to think about putting a professional video together.  In truth:  You people, our readers, are who we aim to please.  If we had enough interest in such a production amongst readers we could probably pool together and do it.  Perhaps next year readers en masse should begin E-Mailing N-sider to personally show interest in such an idea.   

<p><b>Dean:</b> What do we look like? LucasFilm? Lets go to the Bergwalker Ranch and make up some silly E3 videos! With hilarious outtakes and hours of bonus features! Hell lets get our millions of dollars out so we can produce and send out such videos! Being as we're a non-profit site and all.. And I'm done.

I got some serious gaming Q's.</br>
I read alond time ago that Castlevania was in developement for a next gen system, now that the GBA stole the PS2 game is there any news about another Castlevania game on a real system? This is more of an opinion I just sold my extreemly lame Xbox and after pre-ordering and fullt paying off Resident Evil and buying a stragety guide I have $235.00 left what do you think I should buy/ preorder for my Cube? 
</b><br>
<i>-Vlad Tapes</i>

<p><b>Jason:</b> No solid Castlevania info for consoles yet.  For your purchase I would seriously recommend Eternal Darkness.  I think any serious gamer should be excited at how much this game is really pushing the bar.  It has the potential to become game of the year, and maybe (possibly?) one of the greatest games ever crafted.  Of course I have to save final judgement, but the content is there and it has the backing of years in development time.

<p><b>Josh:</b> There were rumours floating around for a while that although the next Castlevania title would be a cross-platform effort, it would appear on the GameCube first, but nothing seemed to materialize out of that; and if anything, I would regard such a rumour with doubt, considering Konami's stubborn lackluster support of the Cube thus far. As for your preordering dilemna, I'd agree 100% with Jason on Eternal Darkness. Don't be put off by the fact that you already got Resident Evil; the two games are worlds apart. Also, don't forget the heavy-hitters of the fall: Mario, Zelda, Metroid, etc. It's never too early to preorder the best-sellers.

why wont my nyko starpad work with 007 agent under fire but it works with all my other games?
</b><br>
<i>-kgdriscoll</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> I honestly have no idea, but I'm not terribly surprised. Third party hardware has a history of being faulty with certain games and in certain conditions.

<p><b>Patrick:</b> I'd advise you to send an e-mail to Nyko's Customer Support. They'll be more than happy to help you with your problem. Just click <a href="mailto:CustomerSupport@nyko.com">here</a></font> to contact them.</p>   

<p><b>Josh:</b> This is actually a known compatibility issue; the Starpad will not work with Agent Under Fire. Future games shouldn't give you any more problems, but as Patrick said, an email to Customer Support couldn't hurt.

Will the pal GameCube have a 60hz scart lead included with it?
And if its' yes, will it be able to work on all televisions or does it need 
special type of television set? 
</b><br>
<i>-Midfat1</i>

<p><b>Anthony P:</b> Ok, here's the deal. You get a normal scart cable out of the box. This will work with any television with a scart outlet. It <b>does not</b> support 60hz, it simply won't work. For 60hz to work on your PAL GameCube you'll need an <b>official</b> Nintendo RGB cable, and I really do mean the official one Midfat1. Apparently Nintendo changed the workings of the PAL GameCube that supports the RGB connection at the last minute not giving third party manufacturers enough time to make the adjustment to their RGB cables. This means if you attempt to use a third party one on your Cube it won't work. You'll see a picture but it will not be running at 60hz. Another factor in this is that not all games support 60hz. Rogue Leader does and I think Luigi's Mansion does as well. Monkey Ball and Wave Race are 50hz PAL optimised, which is as good as 60hz... but not better. Next point in the ever confusing world of scart is, not all televisions will support it. My <i>Beko</i> nearly blew-up when I tried the 60hz mode on it. Poor baby...

<hr><b>
At Gamestop.com in there Gameboy Advance section I see a picture for Grand 
theft auto 3 for the Gba, Do you guys have any information on this game or 
screen shots? Think it will be any good compared to the console version? 
</b><br>
<i>-Ryan D</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> I honestly haven't heard much regarding this title, but I will say that you shouldn't purchase the game for the GBA in the hopes that it will be a portable version of the GTA3 seen on the PS2. GTA3 with an overhead or isometric perspective -- which is what the handheld version will most likely be -- just won't be the same as the console version, especially with the GBA's lack of processing power in comparison to the PS2 factored in; much of the game's shocking appeal will be lost.

<hr><b>
I was thinking about getting my cube modded and import some of the great Japanese games, such as Animal Leader, Doshin (if it doesn't come over) and possibly Rave.  However, before I do I would like some kind of base in the Japanese language.  I know that it's fairly complicated, and there are many different styles, so is there a recommended tape, book, or other thing that can help you to learn Japanese? Yeah, Thanks.
</b><br>
<i>-Joe</i>

<p><b>Jason:</b> Excellent question Joe.  Ah, where to start?  First thing you should know is that there are different kinds of things to learn.  You can learn to read the language, speak the language, or do both.  For an import gaming situation, you normally just want to read the Japanese text, assuming there are no voice-overs.  

<p>Next you should know that everyone learns this sort of thing differently.  Myself, I tried learning Japanese through both tapes and even computer programs that had both sounds and visual aids.  However, I found this way of learning didn't work for me.  It just didn't sink in because there was no real human interaction.  For someone like myself, I need a classroom environment with a teacher.  I could be completely different from yourself though.  Trick is to find what would help you learn more: Learning on your own time with tapes, books, etc. or being in a classroom with a teacher.  Good luck!  Perhaps write in later and tell us how it's going.

<p><b>Josh:</b> You've got to be extraordinarily dedicated if you want to learn Japanese. It's one of the hardest -- if not the hardest -- languages in the world to learn, and it takes time. Invest in some tapes, books, etc., and stick with it. If you're expecting results in a matter of weeks, you've got the wrong attitude.

The Australian launch is iminent and yet nintendo is still pushing Luigi's mansion as the flagship tittle.  Why, and why is SSBM and Pikmin still coming out weeks after the launch?</br>
Seems stupid to me.
</b><br>
<i>-Colin</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> Very simple actually. You have to look at it from a business standpoint. You don't want your gamers to be trying to decide between too many major titles if they don't have the money to buy all of them or the time to play all of them. Not only that, but those major titles are going to get a lot of advertising. All those titles will be eating up potential airtime. So, you want to make sure that you maximize the amount you can sell with the minimum amount of loss in the advertisement section. Spreading out titles is a standard business plan and help the company out in the long run.

<p><b>Jason:</b> Why are you so surprised?  You act like Luigi's Mansion is rubbish that Nintendo themselves should abandon.  Luigi's Mansion is a game that Nintendo could cash in on because it's a great game and uses a great name (i.e. Mario Bros. connection).  Let Luigi have his fame for once would ya?  Smash Bros. and Pikmin will be out in due time too, so play your heart out on the launch games and know that more are just around the corner.

1. Please could you tell me how long the flex is going to be on the Game Cube joypad (UK version).</br>
2. Please could you confirm for me whether or not the Game Cube will come with an RGB Compliant SCART Lead</br>
3. Please could you confirm the price of games for the Game Cube, in the UK.</br>
</b><br>
<i>-Lee</i>

<p><b>Anthony P:</b> 1). Flex? 2). It doesn't come with the RGB compliant one but you can buy the cable from retailers across the country. You may have noticed a shortage of anything "GameCube" in the UK at the moment so hold tight for a couple of weeks untill the Official one is back in stock. 3). One GameCube package with a controller inside is 129.99. Cheapest bundle I saw was the one I got at Dixons, 1*GameCube, *1*Official Memory Card, 1*Joytech Controller, 3*Games of your choice, T-shirt, all for 229.99. Happy hunting.

According to rumors, Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Japan were going to team up for the next Smash Brothers
game by listening to players thoughts and making suggestions.
Is this true or is this just a bunch of lousy peice of crap by the players.
</b><br>
<i>-Brad</i>

<p><b>Patrick:</b> Well, nothing's been confirmed to us by Nintendo, but knowing them as we do, they should have a few tricks up their sleeves for E3 which will be taking place next week. A new version of Super Smash Bros. would be a huge surprise, as we don't expect one in the very near future. With Super Smash Bros. Melee, HAL created a frantic party game packed full with options and game modes, leaving just a few requested features unnoticed. The only real upgrade for now, in my opinion, would be an online Super Smash Bros. game, assuming that HAL doesn't plan on giving the series a massive makeover (such as free movement in 3D arenas).

<p>But honestly, I have no clue whether it's coming or not.</p> 

<p><b>Josh:</b> Well, I think it is coming, but I wouldn't expect the next SSB for a long time (4th quarter 2003 at the earliest), and so consequently, at this point what it's going to feature is anyone's guess. Anything you read on the internet about the next SSB title, therefore, is likely unconfirmed speculation.

<hr><b>
Could you please tell me when/where I can purchase the nintendo component video cable for the Gamecube, and the exact cost of this cable.
</b><br>
<i>-James</i>

<p><b>Patrick:</b> The Nintendo GameCube Component Video Cable is already available. You can order it at Nintendo's own store, just click <a href="http://store.nintendo.com">here</a> to go there. As you can see, the cable will cost you $29,95. 

<p><b>Josh:</b> Also, note that at this point, you cannot get the component video cable anywhere else but Nintendo's online store, unless you manage to stumble upon a used one somewhere.

<hr><b>
Wanted to tell you I read your recent Nintendo FAQ on nintendo's internal and 1st-party teams, and I have to say it revealed a *lot* I didn't know. what I'd like to know, however, is what position is Browny Brown in? Are they a first party, completely owned by a Nintendo, a 2nd-party, or a loyal 3rd-party, like Camelot or Factor 5? Also, isn't Retro now a first-party?
</b><br>
<i>-Eric</i>

<p><b>Patrick:</b> To clear things up, then: Brownie Brown is a fully owned Nintendo subsidiary, meaning Nintendo owns a whopping 100% of the company. And yes, Retro Studios is now a Nintendo firstparty developer. As N-Sider <a href="http://n-sider.com/index_content.php?page=news/50202retro.htm">reported</a> on May 2, Nintendo announced that they had bought out former owner Jeff Spangenberg. 

<hr><b>
Is Camelot a 2nd party or not?
</b><br>
<i>-Li</i>

<p><b>Anthony P:</b> Camelot (like Factor5) are a third party, with a taste for all things cube shaped. 

<p><b>Jason:</b> Listen to our boy Anthony, he knows what he's talking about.

<hr><b>
Do you have some info about the coming zelda and pokemon games to the gameboy advance i heard about pokemon coming to gameboy advance along time ago and zelda recently. Cant you put some info about these games plzz
</b><br>
<i>-ahmjab</i>

<p><b>Jason:</b> As luck may have it, PlanetGamecube just broke an exclusive story about <a href="http://www.shiggy.net/news.cfm?action=item&id=2998">Zelda on GBA</a>.  Also, we reported on some Pokemon Advance information earlier, including screens and posters.  The game looks to be of a similar style to the older games but with slightly upgraded graphical effects.  Perhaps E3 will be the source of more info?  Sorry, I couldn't help it.  One week folks!  

<p><b>Patrick:</b> We'd like to give you more information, but we don't have any! Some time ago, when we received the latest GBA Pokmon artwork and screens from Nintendo, we were told to not expect any more information until E3. Seeing as that event is now just a week away, we're getting pretty excited!
