<p>The gamecube logo kinda sucks but oh well, its ok
dont u think ps2's logo is better?</p>

<p>-GoofyGuy</p>

<p><b>Pete: I think the GameCube logo is spiffy. The purple might not be the greatest color, but it still serves its purpose.</b></p>

<p>I know that there is going to be a big announcement by a major japanese
developer, could you tell us who are all of the big japanese players, and who
do you think its going to be?</b></p>

<p>-Mrmessia</p>

<p><b>Pete: There are going to be some big announcements at E3, including a big Sega announcement. You'll find out soon enough.</b></p>

<p>First of all GREAT SITE. Second- Will the Gamecube be equiped with a fan? If not will I have to worry about it overheating?</p>

<p>-Chris S.</p>

<p><b>Pete: Yes, I believe the GameCube has two vent openings on its sides and there are two "mini-fans" there.</b></p>

<p> 1.) About how much will Nintendo's Gamecube cost at launch in Europe?

<p>2.) Will Nintendo be releasing a special peripheral that will play DVD movies and
music CDs on the base unit GameCube console?

<p>3.) How many games will be available at launch and how much will they cost?

<p>4.) What colours will GameCube be availabe in at launch?

<p>5.) How will the Gameboy Advance interact with the Nintendo GameCube console?

<p>6.) Will the corner sides on he GameCube console eventually be curved to look
more rounded and smoother?

<p>7.) When will more official information on GameCube and Gameboy Advance be
available?

<p>8.) Will the GameCube have any internet access like online Perfect Dark
deathmatches and online Mario Kart races?

<p>9.) Will Namco, Capcom, Kemco, Squaresoft and Enix be third-party developers
maybe second-party developers for the Gamecube?

<p>10.) The GameCube controller has not been finalised in it's design, does that mean
it will look even cooler than it's current design the next time we officially
see it?

<p>-Midfat</b>

<p><b>Pete: Wow, lots of questions there. Let me sort them out here...</p>

<p>1.) Take PS2's current price and slash off 80-100 pounds. That would be my guess.</p>

<p>2.) Nope, from the looks of it, a regular sized DVD wouldn't be able to fit into the GameCube's loading tray, so that kind of rules that possibility out. Matsushita/Panasonic are releasing a DVD player/GameCube combo machine, but they haven't announced whether or not they'll be releasing that outside of Japan just yet.</p>

<p>3.) My guess would be 12 games. We'll likely have a better idea tomorrow. Expect game prices in the $49.99 US range.</p>

<p>4.) Well we know purple is a lock, hopefully Nintendo will offer at least silver as an alternative. Again we should have a better idea in a few hours.</p>

<p>5.) Data-swapping will be probably a key feature in that you'll be able to take data from your GameCube game and put it into your GBA titles and vice versa. This could unlock secret levels, characters, etc. I'm also betting in addition to be able to use the GBA as a secondary GameCube controller, you'll also be able to play GBA games on your TV via the GameCube and a special GameCube GBA TV disc.</p>

<p>6.) I was kind of hoping for that myself, but it seems Nintendo is sticking with the sharp corners.</p>

<p>7.) In a few hours. Yes, I know I'm repeating myself, but it feels good to say it.</p>

<p>8.) Yes, I'm sure of that. Maybe not at launch, but definitely in 2002.</p>

<p>9.) No, I don't see any of those companies becoming Nintendo 2nd party developers. Namco, Capcom, and Konami are already onboard as 3rd party developers if it makes you feel better.</p>

<p>10.) Yes.</p></b>

<p>Hi Guys, why the f**k did ea port the playstation 2 version of madden 2000 to the gamecube when they clearly could have used the gamecubes strengths especially since they already have done benchmark tests on the cube?</p>

<p>I'll tell you why, because they do not want the cube to look superior to the ps2 which they have been licking ass to for the last year or so and secondly because they 'can't be bothered' to code an engine from scratch' and recently during an interview with ea canada for a job it was plainly obvious that ea choose to favour the most shallow commercially viable'hip' ps2. what a bunch of wankers. god! that company is so uncreative and boring.</p>

<p>-Narendar G.</p>

<p><b>Pete: Well that's EA for you. The plus side is they're supporting GameCube with a lot of games (I don't have to remind you about Dreamcast, do I?), the downside is that most of those will be PS2 or PC ports. That's just the way EA is generally; you don't exactly see huge jumps in their main franchises like <i>Madden NFL</i> every year too often. EA is all about the bottom line, getting the games out there with efficiency. That's not to say they don't have very slick engines and strong game play, because they certainly do, but EA is not a company known for doing more than they have to.</b></p>

<p>Since the gamecube is more powerful than the N64, Do you think mario (and other nintendo characters) will look more like their 3d prerendered counter parts?</p>

<p>-Jacque L.

<p><b>Pete: Yeah, certainly. Looking at the <i>Luigi's Mansion</i> demo, Luigi is definitely
very smooth and comparable to the pre-renders Nintendo uses.</b></p>

<p>Sirs,

<p>With the unveilling of Lucas Arts/Factor 5 developed Rogue Leader: RS2, it signals that the official hype machine for the gamecube has officially begun. Heck this is only one game but it has somehow already captured the attention of every gamer, and this is pretty good for the full unveilling of GCN next week at E3. With this recent event, Nintendo knows that it got all the gamers exactly where they want them to be, which is to ride the hype. I'm sure the GCN will not dissapoint at E3, but what I'm worried about is that after Nintendo made a statement that their GCN is a must own, they will finally drop the bomb on all expectant GCN owner that they will Delay the launch of GCN until next year at least in the US. What do you think about this?

<p>-Jonie boy.

<p><b>Pete: Don't you dare mention the dreaded "D" word! Seriously, that would really suck, but I think Nintendo announced the GameCube delay beforehand on purpose, so it wouldn't interfere with the E3 hype.</b></p>

<p>What game do you think will get the most attention at E3?</p>

<p>-Robert L.S.

<p><b>Pete: Well if I had to guess right now, I'd say the Luigi (is Mario in there?) title. I do think Miyamoto is going to pull a big surprise out of his magic hat, however. And I suspect it'll be a totally new game.</b></p>

<p>What's up with just Luigi in his own game? I want my Mario damnit! I don't mind Luigi as long as I get my Mario.</p>

<p>-AngryFan23

<p><b>Pete: Well this issue has obviously caused a big stir. I suggest waiting just a little while. We don't know exactly what kind of game it is. I doubt the entire game is vacuuming up after ghosts. Also <i>Super Mario World 2</i> didn't have Mario in the starring role. It had you shooting eggs most of the time instead of bopping on goombas. As I recall, that game turned out pretty good, didn't it?</b></p>

<p>Is Phantasy Star Online version 2.0 coming to the GameCube. The first version totally rocked on the Dreamcast and is one of my favorite games, and I hope Sonic Team brings this one to the GameCube. Also Monkey Ball from Sega looks interesting. Is that a NGC game?</p>

<p>-Nat P.</p>

<p><b>Pete: <i>Phantasy Star Online</i>...on GameCube? Now, I wouldn't know anything about that one ;). According to GameSpot, <i>Monkey Ball</i> is coming to the GameCube. E3 is going to be great for Sega and Nintendo fans.</b></p>

<p><i>Well, that's it I'm done! E3...so....close. Can't answer anymore....questions. Its show time, people! Get ready...</i></p>
