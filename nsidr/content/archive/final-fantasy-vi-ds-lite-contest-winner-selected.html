Last week we put up a copy of Final Fantasy VI Advance for the GBA and a brand-new Nintendo DS lite for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2697">giveaway</a>, and the results have been officially judged.  We'd like to congratulate one John Cuneo for being chosen as the winner.  Your prize is on the way!<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone else for your entries, and we hope to hear from you again in future contests!
