The team responsible for <i>Battalion Wars</i> is hard at work on an expanded version of Xbox Live Arcade hit <i>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</i>, but this time it's for Nintendo DS and Wii.<br />
<br />
<i>Geometry Wars: Galaxies</i> will, according to Nintendo's official Nintendo Power magazine, be transformed from its arcade-style roots to a more traditional style title with a single-player campaign.  The Wii version will make use of motion control and the DS version touch control for gameplay.  Both versions of the game will also feature a multiplayer mode, and the magazine says gameplay from Retro Evolved will be included as well.<br />
<br />
Galaxies is headed for both platforms this fall.  No word on whether the Wii version will make an appearance on the Wii Shop Channel, or in stores.
