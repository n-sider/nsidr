Nintendo of America announced today that <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>, sequel to GameCube juggernaut <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> and likely trendsetter for per-console installments of the franchise, has set a first-week sales record for the regional office.<br />
<br />
Brawl moved 874,000 copies on its first day and racked up 1.4 million at the conclusion of its first week on sale on March 16.  Melee moved 7 million copies worldwide over its lifetime&#8212;and we're well aware that comparing worldwide sales and U.S. sales are somewhat silly&#8212;but we can't resist noting that this is a full 20% of Melee's lifetime worldwide sales.  What this means is left to an exercise for the reader, but if Brawl has legs like Melee, it just might end up outshining its predecessor.
