Three titles grace the Wii Shop Channel's Virtual Console service this week, with an overwhelming ninja theme permeating the list.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Pac-Man</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Ninja Gaiden</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Ninja Spirit</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
As usual, the titles go up at 9 a.m. Pacific Time, and Wii Points are still available at an exchange rate of 100 points for one of your American dollars.
