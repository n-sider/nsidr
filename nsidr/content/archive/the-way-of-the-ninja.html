One of our community was once pretty hard-core into a free PC game called <i>N</i>.  I mentally filed it with things I should check out some day, but getting into a PC game is not something I regularly do.  (Mostly, I don't have the setup, but I've not really sat in front of a computer with an entertainment mindset in a decade.)  Since then, though, XBLA, PSP, and DS versions of a followup called <i>N+</i> have appeared, and I just spent my last few Amazon gift card dollars on the $17 DS version.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3827-1.jpg" width="163" height="153" class="image_styled" /></div>I don't believe I've enjoyed an Atari release this much in a long while, actually.  <i>N+</i> consists of hundreds of small platforming levels, a ticking clock, a myriad ways to die, and perfect platforming controls and physics&mdash;something bigger-budget platformers seem to lose sight of these days.  It reminds me slightly of <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> in structure; there, too, the challenge was to complete a sequence of short challenges, with failure meaning trying each small challenge over again.  It's a great game mode, especially when held up to the lengthy "retrace steps to try again" you get in bigger platformers like <i>Super Mario 64</i>.<br />
<br />
Much like its free cousin, my version of <i>N+</i> comes with a level editor that gives you complete freedom to create levels just like the ones in the game.  There are ten save slots and there's <i>supposed</i> to be a community server for sharing levels with others, but it doesn't seem to be working right now.  (I'm trying to find out why.)  It is a pretty neat feature to have, even if I've yet to create a "real" level with it.<br />

I thanked that friend this morning before he headed out into the bitter cold.  I think I warmed his heart a little.
