<p>Nintendo revealed it will release a new color of its Nintendo DS Lite in Japan on July 20, 2006.  It's a very soft shade of pink that Nintendo appropriately calls "<a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/index.html">Noble Pink</a>".  The unit will retail for the standard DS price of around $144 (16,800 Yen).</p>

<p>Nintendo released the Crystal White version of its Nintendo DS Lite handheld in Japan to much fan-fare on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1800" style="text-decoration: none; border-style: none none dotted none; border-width: 0px 0px 1px 0px">March 2</a>.  This was followed by the colors Enamel Navy and Ice Blue on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1819" style="text-decoration: none; border-style: none none dotted none; border-width: 0px 0px 1px 0px">March 11</a>.  Each week since the Lite has sold on average 160,000 units. These outstanding numbers have been accompanied by reports over the past three months that indicate Nintendo has been facing a severe shortage of its handheld throughout Japan.  The company has said the problem stems from issues with production of the "bicolor molding."  Once the kinks in production are solved, Nintendo has planned worldwide shipments of more than two million DS units each month.  Together the Nintendo DS and its Lite brother are quickly approaching 20 million units sold worldwide.</p>
