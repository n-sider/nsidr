Another week, another batch of Virtual Console games now available to the Wii Shop Channel.  In a stunning defeat for my powers of prognostication, <i>Paper Mario</i> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2778">didn't make it</a>, but some other noteworthies&mdash;and not-so-noteworthies&mdash;did:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>ActRaiser</i> (SNES, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Kid Chameleon</i> (Sega Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>J.J. & Jeff</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
The above-named games actually went live at 9 a.m. yesterday, but you'll perhaps forgive us for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2806">taking the day off</a>.  You can get the games now in exchange for some of your stash of Wii Points, which are still available at the rate of roughly $1 for 100.
