<p>Namco Hometek, Namco's North American publishing subsidiary, said the GameCube-exclusive RPG <i>Tales of Symphonia</i> will arrive in stores on an unspecified date this Summer.</p>

<p>Using a unique stylized anime/cel-shaded graphics and a traditional but enjoyable battle-system, <i>Tales of Symphonia</i> garnered high marks when it was released in Japan last year.  The game is said to offer over 80 hours of gameplay.</p>

<p>The Tales series dates back to 1995, when Tales of Destiny was first released on the SNES.  <i>Tales of Symphonia</i> will surely be shown at the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo in May, although there has been no official word as yet.</p>
