The <a href="http://mother3.fobby.net">Mother 3 Fan Translation</a> project has released a menu patch for the Japanese release of Mother 3.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Brawl will <a href="http://mother3.fobby.net/2007/08/10/38/">"ABSOLUTELY, UNQUESTIONABLY spoil MOTHER 3"</a></li>
  <li>The group had set a tentative goal to release a patch before Brawl's release, but is running out of time</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://mother3.fobby.net/menupatch/">menu patch</a> translates menus and items but leaves the story text untouched&#8212;players will have to use a walkthrough</li>
  <li>The team continues to work on the complete translation patch and will release it when it's completely done</li>
  </ul><br />
