<i>We're counting down to the Wii's launch with a daily look at what retro games we'd like to see on the Virtual Console.  Each also features a Virtual Console Likelihood rating.  A rating of 5 means the game has officially been announced for the service.

It's coming.  Ecco The Dolphin has been confirmed to be coming to Virtual Console.  That makes me happy.  Actually, dolphins always make me happy, from memories of waiting for the GameCube to be released, to the opening musical number from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Ecco is part RPG, part action platformer, and all fun.  Using echolocation to navigate through the seas, swimming at high speeds to defeat enemies, and even just flipping in the air for fun.  All the best parts of being a dolphin are included, except for the mating.<br />

Ecco is a very intelligent and brave dolphin, so when a storm plunges his home into chaos, he sets off on an adventure to find his pod and save the ocean.  The story is very good compared to most action games, so calling it more of an RPG is not a stretch.  Talking to creatures by "singing" allows Ecco to discover what created the storm and where to go next.  Eventually the story involves locating Atlantis, visiting prehhistoric societies, and discovering time travel technology.<br />
<br />
Ecco and its sequels eventually bring us to a world where dolphins and humans coexist in a united society, facing common enemies, and going on even more difficult adventures through time.  It's going to be fun to revisit this world again.  <br />

With Squaresoft and Nintendo not on the best of terms during the N64 generation, the demand for a sequel to Super Mario RPG on the SNES was going unanswered.  Luckily for us, Nintendo partnered with Intelligent Systems to create a new RPG for Mario and friends.  This game used the power of the N64 to create a world made of paper, where all the characters are two dimensional beings living in a three dimensional world.  It became one of the best games released on the N64, and it's sequel for the GameCube ended up even better.  <br />

When Bowser steals the mystical Star Rod from Star Haven, the seven Star Spirits are turned into playing cards.  Using the Star Rod, Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and even kidnaps the entire Mushroom Kingdom castle! Yes, it's obviously a Mario game plot, but it sets the stage for a really entertaining game.  Unlike most RPGs, Paper Mario involves the player in the combat process, by introducing Action Commands, similar to Mario RPG's Timed Hits.  Pushing the "A" button at the right time in battle allows you to do more damage and take less from enemies, depending on the situation.  As a result, battles are fast paced and never get boring.<br />

Mario also meets various allies throughout the game, which can follow Mario and each have unique abilities.  They also are helpful in combat, but only one can be following Mario at a time, so you must choose the best helper for each job.  Unfortunately, Luigi once again gets shafted, and is not playable in the game, although you can talk to him at various points in the adventure.  <br />
<br />
If you're a fan of Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door, or haven't tried either game yet, give this one a shot.
