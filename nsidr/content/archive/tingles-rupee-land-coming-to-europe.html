European site CubedÂ³'s Adam Riley <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/preview/237/">has played</a> what many suspected might not actually exist: an English translation of <i>Tingle's Rupee Land</i>.<br />
<br />
The title has already sold over 200,000 units in Nintendo's home territory of Japan, and has been the subject of much speculation outside that territory&mdash;with the unpopularity of the Tingle character in North America et al (message boards all over were quite joyful that Tingle did not appear in recent Zelda installment <i>Twilight Princess</i>, for example), nobody really expected Nintendo to consider bringing this title over.<br />
<br />
It seems Tingle just may have his day in Europe, however.  Whether this translates into an appearance stateside is yet unknown: Nintendo of America has yet to make their intents known beyond <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2321">a tentative survey</a> asking customers what they thought about the matter.
