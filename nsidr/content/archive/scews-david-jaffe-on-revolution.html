<p>In what seems to be <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1303">the beginning of a parade</a> of favorable Revolution impressions from Nintendo's competition, God of War director David Jaffe writes on his blog, <a href="http://davidjaffe.modblog.com/">jaffes game design</a> (edited for clarity):</p>

<blockquote><p>I like it, can't wait to play with it... worried -- as a player -- it could be a novelty that gets old... but Nintendo is not dumb and they must know the whole 'novelty burnout' is a risk so they are prob. doing all they can to make sure that doesn't happen... I think it's a great idea....</p></blockquote>
