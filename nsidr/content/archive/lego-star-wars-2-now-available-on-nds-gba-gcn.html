"LEGO Star Wars II, like the first game, is a great entry-level title for young Star Wars fans looking to expand their videogame horizons. Its violence is never scary, its humor is always funny, and its gameplay is always fun. Sure it's easy and simple, and it does get hit by the repetition bug now and again. But the bottom line is that it's a heck of a lot of fun and has a great amount of replay value beyond a single play-through. Best family game this year? Probably so."

"As much fun as Lego Star Wars II is, it's unfortunate that it had to come second. Some of the novelty of the gameplay, as well as the concept itself, isn't quite as potent as it was the first time around. The original Star Wars trilogy just seems more deserving of this nostalgic treatment than the prequels. Still, anyone with even a sliver of nostalgia for Star Wars will find this to be a fun, good-natured romp."

"Sure, LEGO Star Wars II may not seem as cool as a "real" Star Wars game, but the fact remains that it's easily one of the best titles in the franchise in recent years. Its kiddy facade hides some terrifically fun gameplay with a lot of meat on its bones. When you're at your local videogame store, feel free to claim that the game is for your child or a younger sibling, and by all means (assuming you actually have one of them), be sure to play it with them. Just don't be surprised if you continue playing long after they trot off to bed."
