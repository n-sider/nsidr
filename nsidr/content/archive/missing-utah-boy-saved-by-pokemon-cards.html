<p>For those unfamiliar with this story, 11-year-old boy, Brennan Hawkins, was lost for four days this past week in the mountain wilderness of Bountiful, Utah. The young lad was found alive and well on Tuesday, June 21st following an extensive search of the area by rescue workers and search parties.

<p>In a press conference earlier today, Brennan's mother, Jody Hawkins, revealed to the press what could perhaps be one of the most bizarre reasons for a lost child to keep hope alive of being found by searchers.

<p>According to NBC News, "One of the first things he asked about was whether the Pokemon cards he ordered had arrived yet, his parents said."

<p><I>He ordered them on eBay last week, and I tell you, thats what got him off that mountain,</I> his mother, Jody, said. <I>They were here.</I> I guess even though the loveable pocket monsters of Nintendo fame aren't real, they are still more than capable of saving youngsters in trouble.
