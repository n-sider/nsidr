<p>French site Phantasy Online has <a href="http://www.phantasy-online.net/sid-dafa3bfc40ecb9c37b92e21203086cad-section-jeuxvideo-rubrique-news-id-1970.html?sid=dafa3bfc40ecb9c37b92e21203086cad">new images</a> from the Japanese version of upcoming Wii surgery game <cite>Trauma Center: Second Opinion</cite>.</p>

<p>Publisher Atlus has also noted several things about the game.  Second Opinion is not going to be a straight-up port of the DS title <cite>Trauma Center: Under the Knife</cite>, but will offer substantial brand-new content including surgical implements, operation types, additional playable characters with new missions, multiple difficulty levels, and revised controls for the Wii Remote.  That all said, the game is still fundamentally a remake of the original, but one that's been added to and changed substantially.</p>

<p>Atlus plans to release Second Opinion alongside the Wii at launch, whenever that may be.</p>
