<p>Nintendo Gal has <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/967-Bob-Ross-Video-Game-Developer-Joseph-Hatcher-Exclusive-Interview!.html">an interview with AGFRAG's Joseph Hatcher</a>, currently working on creating a Wii and Nintendo DS-targeted game based on the late Bob Ross's Joy of Painting, which we <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1902">previously covered</a>.</p>

<p>In the interview, Hatcher goes into his motivation for creating the game.  "I grew up watching Bob Ross with my mom as a kid and I enjoyed sitting down with my mom, good bonding time, and watching the Bob Ross show and I was amazed with how he made these paintings so easily in such a little time," Hatcher explains.  "Between probably Bob Ross, the movie Tron, and Atari arcade games that's what helped spark my interest and inspiration a little bit to be creative and make video games."</p>

Kind of funny but it's true and then the remaining percentage (about 3%-4%) actually watch his show to learn how to paint and buy paint supplies and have a desire to get into painting and being an artist."</p>

<p>So far, Hatcher has been approached by "more than 5, less than 15" publishers with interest in the game.  He plans to personally attend this year's E3 show, though at the time of the interview, he isn't sure whether he'll have any news to share yet.  AGFRAG's game certainly is one of the most unique ideas possibly headed for Wii, and definitely one that could expand Nintendo's market &mdash; if Hatcher can find a publisher.</p>
