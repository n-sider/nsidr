<b>Custom Robo</b><br>
<font size="1">2004 Nintendo</font>

<p>Nintendo's <i>Custom Robo</i> series originated on the Nintendo 64 from developer Noise and agent Marigul.  The Nintendo 64 versions of the game never saw a release outside of Japan. That's about to change as <i>Custom Robo 2</i> for GameCube has the potential to be the first to see a North American release.  Shown at the recent E3 Expo, <i>Custom Robo</i> is a sci-fi role-playing game featuring an extensive first player story and multiplayer modes.

<p>In the game, players get to customize their own battle robot using more than 200 different body parts and weapons and then put it to the test against other robots in one of the game's 30 battle arenas.

<p>The story takes place on an unknown planet in the not-too-distant future. On this world, a surge in crime involving dangerous, miniature robotic weapons known as Custom Robos occurs. Those that manipulate the Custom Robos are commonly called "Commanders," and through specialized training, they learn to manipulate the robots' actions through the use of brain waves. One day, the hero of the game Lei and his comrades learn of an incredibly strong robot with autonomous maneuvering capabilities. In their search for a logical explanation regarding the existence of this powerful foe, the hero and his comrades uncover a secret about an event that occurred on this planet several hundred years ago.

<p>To begin the multiplayer portion of the game, players must select from a variety of robot parts to assemble his or her desired fighting machine. There will be a wide variety of bodies in the game, each with its own base statistics in speed and power. There will be a wide range of customization from pointy-edged mecha to smaller, more humanoid machines to robots with larger, tanklike designs.

<p>From here, players can customize their weapons, which include a main gun, a bomb, and a pod - which is basically a slow-moving missile. Players can also adjust the legs on their robot to configure things such as midair jumps, dashes, etc.

<p>Once your robot is finished, you're sent into a relatively small arena to duke it out against up to three other human or computer-controlled robots.  Multiplayer battles will occur on the same screen, in a style similar to <i>Super Smash Bros</i>.  Each battle starts off with a casting of dice which transform into the opposing robots.

<p>The game's controls are described as "simple". Players run around the arena, while hammering away on the fire button and carefully timing jumps, charge attacks, pod releases, and bombs.

<p>Matches end either when the time expires or when only one robo is left standing.

<p>Custom Robo successfully combines two highly addictive gameplay elements - Pokmon-style roleplaying and one-on-one shooting action - into one package. <i>Custom Robo</i> has been praised for its long list of features and frantic multiplayer gameplay.  Little is knkown about the game, and even less about its one-player mode.  The game is also rumored to feature 8-player LAN support.  <i>Custom Robo</i> currently holds a tentative 2004 release date.
