<p>Electronic Arts said it will have <i>The Urbz: Sims in the City</i> prepared for the launch of the Nintendo DS in November 2004.</p>

<p>Griptonite Games will handle development of the title. EA says <i>The Urbz: Sims in the City</i> will benefit from the Nintendo DS capabilities by offering players a wireless multi-player mode and a touch-screen input menu system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">"We're thrilled that this new franchise is the first from Electronic Arts to illustrate the power of the Nintendo DS," said Sinjin Bain, Vice President and Executive Producer. "On the Nintendo DS, we are able to do things with The Urbz: Sims in the City that we could not do with any other console. Like the system itself, this game is completely unique. Never before have Sims players been able to unleash their alter egos in an urban environment - complete with the sounds, scenes and settings of the city."</font></p>

<p>The title looks essentially the same as the Game Boy Advance version.  You can find screens and more information on that game <a href="http://www.eagames.com/redesign/games/gba/urbz/home.jsp">here</a>.</p>
