A future version of one of the earliest Wii channels, the Photo Channel, is about to get a bizarre cross-grade for its music support.<br />
<br />
In early December 2007, a new version of the channel will support AAC files for .  AAC files are generally associated with Apple's iTunes, and sport higher quality or smaller filesizes due to their use of the superior MPEG-4 codec.  Additionally, users will be able to choose a favorite photo to display in the Photo Channel's slot on the Wii Menu.  However, these new features come at a price: version 1.1 of the channel will drop the existing MP3 support.<br />
<br />
Wii consoles shipped in December will begin to come with the new version of the channel already installed, and customers who end up with this version of the channel will not be able to downgrade to the original version.<br />
