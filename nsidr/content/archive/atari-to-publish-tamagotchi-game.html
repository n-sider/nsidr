<p>Previously only available in Japan, Atari has announced that it will bring Bandai's <i>Tamagotchi Connexion Corner Shop</i> to the Nintendo DS in early 2006.</p>

<p>The goal of the game is to run a shop successfully in the Tamagotchi universe.  Players can choose to run any of a variety of different shops, including a bakery, beauty salon, dentist's office, and a flower shop.  Players perform tasks with the touch screen in pursuit of their goal of having their shop favorably regarded by Princess Tamako.</p>
