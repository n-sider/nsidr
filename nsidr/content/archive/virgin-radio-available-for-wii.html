Utilizing the Internet Channel available as a download from the Wii Shop Channel, you can now get several stations from the UK's Virgin Radio <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6541035.stm">streamed directly to your system</a>.<br />
<br />
Virgin is making available four stations on the system, including the main Virgin Radio station as well as Virgin Radio Xtreme, Virgin Radio Classic Rock, and Virgin Radio Groove.  Videos and exclusive session recordings will be made available, as well as the opportunity to buy tickets and CDs or download tracks (presumably the latter to a personal computer, as we're not aware of any way to make that work on Wii.)<br />
<br />
The service is also available for Sony's PlayStation 3, through its own web browser.
