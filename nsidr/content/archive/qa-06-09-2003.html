<hr><h3>GBA SP battery replacement</h3>
<p>
<b>
As you know The GBA-SP uses a special rechargable battle rather than those money sucking double A's. My concern is lets say 

in the way future i wanna replace the battery like when the SP is far outdated, will i be able to do soo. I know they will 

have replacement batteries for several years... but lets say a decade from now... And God forbid nintendo is gone from the 

software industrym will i be able to go to a radio shack or a watch store to by a battery that will run in the SP? I'ld be 

pretty pissed if i wasnt able to due to the fact that i feel that this GBA is a timeless from of entertainment ( yes i still 

whip out my tetris that came with the bulky old school gameboy)

<p><b>Josh:</b> The current situation is that the unit must be sent in to Nintendo for battery replacement. Whether this will 

change in the future is unknown, but I'd be willing to bet that this will be the setup for the forseeable future. If and when 

Nintendo withdraws from the business, the issue of GBA SP's battery will be addressed then.

<hr><h3>Capcom Zelda?</h3>
<p>
<b>
It wasn't shown at E3, but it was reported back in
February that Capcom was well underway with a new LoZ
game for GBA.  Did any of you happen to hear any new
information on this game?
 



 </b><br>

<i>-james garlington</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> The Capcom Zelda is indeed underway, but we've not heard anything about the game since the initial 

announcement in February. Pressing questions like its release date and whether or not it will feature connectivity with the 

next GameCube iteration of Zelda remain unanswered.




<hr><h3>Nintendo @ E3</h3>
<p>
<b>
Dear N-sider,
<br>                    First off I want to say your site is great, I pay enough for DSL in that I don't want to pay access 

to the news.  My biggest concern about E3 was that I was a little disappointed by the big N's showing.  Who cares about those 

2 Zelda games, they seem like either mini games or side quests, no real substance.  There was no surprises, at least that I 

know of.  There was no Mario 128, no too human, no killer ap, they showed MGS but I already played the same thing for the PS1 

so there is nothing but updated graphics that are new.  So my question comes down to is there anything to really be happy 

about with E3?  All in all I am a lil disappointed, because obviously XBOX has Halo 2 in the wings and PS2 has Vice City 

still selling like hot cakes.  Where does that leave the big N?  Oh yeah where was Zoonami?  Thanx in advance

<p><b>Josh:</b> There's no denying that this year's E3 did not hold the same "shock and awe" factor for Nintendo as it often 

has in years past, and the primary reason for this, as you cited, is that there were no surprises. Nintendo revealed most of 

its big draws prior to the show; imagine if Resident Evil 4, the Metal Gear Solid remake, and Mario Kart Double Dash were 

debuted at the show, rather than beforehand. I think that this would've given the show a bit more "pop" that it was lacking.
<p>
Nonetheless, I think most would agree with you that there was no single "killer app" at this year's show that would make a 

non-GameCube owner sit up and say, "Hey! I need that game, so I need a GameCube." And let's face it: no Nintendo game shown 

has quite the mass appeal and hype as a game like Halo 2. Nonetheless, I think the rest of this year should be fairly kind to 

the already-existing system owners. F-Zero GX, Mario Kart Double Dash, Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, Pikmin 2, Soul 

Calibur 2, Rogue Leader 3, viewtiful Joe, Wario World, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, and Prince of Persia are all games 

worth at least considering to buy. 
<p>
As far as Zoonami's whereabouts: good question. I suspect Game Zero was not quite ready for a public showing, as if it was, 

Nintendo would've certainly displayed it to bolster their lineup.

<h3>Game Boy Player multiplayer</h3>
<p>


<b>
Hey guys,
<br>         Of course I lust over your site on a nightly basis, you guys got something special here.  Quick question gurus, 

are you telling me that if I purchased a Game Boy Player for my Cube that I could say, stick in Mario Kart Super Circuit or A 

Link to the Past/Four Swords in there and play the multiplayer games simply with my Gamecube controllers?  Peace, love and 

sweet kisses.






</b><br>
<i>-Oliver Klozov-</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Thanks for the...uh...lusting, but I'm afraid that I only have disappointing news: Game Boy Advance games 

played through the Game Boy Player can not be played multiplayer simply by adding other GameCube controllers; you'll need 

additional Game Boy units for that.

<p><b>Brenden:</b>Hey, thanks for the peace, love and sweet kisses. Maybe a cookie next time too? I like cookies. Anyway, I 

recently imported a GameBoy Player (a modded GameCube or FreeLoader is required to load the boot disk each time you boot it 

up) and hooking up 4 controllers does not work at all. While it would be a novel idea, the GB Player does not support any 

form of split screen format. That isn't to say you can't enjoy multiplayer gaming with the add-on. It has your standard EXT 

port to connect the link cable to and it works just wonderfully. I highly recommend acquiring one when it's released on our 

western shores if you're sick of bending your neck over for those long periods of game time. The only downside on the 

multiplayer aspect is that everyone else can see your screen. Luckily, most of the time, they're too busy paying attention to 

their own screen to care.

<h3>GBA cart sizes</h3>
<p>


<b>
I was reading the article "Sony PSP - Friend or Foe" and noticed that the GBA medium is said to be "theoretically unlimited 

in size". I was wondering what that meant and if the meaning that first comes to mind is really possible.

                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                             
 
</b><br>
<i>-Jeff Breheny</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> This simply means that the GBA can read carts of any size, and that carts <i>can</i> be any size. It's just a 

matter of the cost and technology available at the time.

<h3>Sega Sports: MIA</h3>
<p>


<b>
Hello,<br>
My name is Tyree and my question: is Sega still going to drop their sports line-up for my Gamecube. Thanks 

 
                                                                                                          
</b><br>
<i>-Tyree</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Sorry, but Sega has dropped their sports line from the GameCube, citing lackluster sales as the reason. For 

the record, their decision was admittedly justified, as sports titles are notorious for having poor sales on the GameCube 

even with just EA producing, let alone with Sega in the mix.

<h3>Game Boy games to get</h3>
<p>


<b>
 Great site, a have a couple of questions for you. I have never owned 
any iteration of the gameboy, but i am going to break that habit, by buying a 
GBA SP in the coming weeks. my question is what is the first game i should get 
for my gba sp? I already know im going to get both golden sun's eventually. 
But, i would like to know what is the next best action/adventure or rpg that i 
can get? Finally, i know i want to buy one of the GBA Castlevania's, but, out 
of the three,  which one is the most worthy of my money? Oh, one more thing, 
ive already decided im not getting the GBA A link to the past, i already have 
beaten the hell out of it on my SNES.       Thanks for your time, 

</b><br>
<i>-Jeff</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Well, since you specified action/adventure and/or RPG, I'm going to resist the urge to recommend Advance 

Wars, though I strongly suggest you check it out if you're even remotely interested in the RTS genre; it's probably the best 

game on the system right now. You'll probably enjoy both iterations of Golden Sun, as long as you are okay with the slow 

story pacing and extensive emoting. As far as the Castlevania games, reports indicate that Aria of Sorrow is the best version 

to date, though personally I have only played Circle of the Moon so far (very enjoyable, by the way). As for other games, 

consider Super Mario Advance 2 (Super Mario World) and 3 (Yoshi's Island), Wario Ware, Metroid Fusion, and Sonic Advance 1 

and 2 for starters.

<h3>PN03</h3>
<p>


<b>
I was just wondering if you guys heard anything about the upcoming US release of P.N.03.  It got subpar import reviews and 

supposedly tanked in japan when it was first released.  It was scheduled to be the first released of the capcom 5 but then it 

got pushed back to a september release behind viewtiful joe (which is awesome!).  Aside from the earlier reviews no one seems 

to be talking about this title much but it looked to have a lot of promise.  Is there any way that capcom maybe delayed the 

us release in order to rework the problems p.n.03 had and the u.s. release will be a lot better than the original?? i was 

hoping against odds this would be the case, but I'd appreciate any info.  
 


</b><br>
<i>-Albert Hsu</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Most reports indicated that the game is nothing more than mediocre shooter, with irritating controls and 

bland repetitive environments. It may have been delayed to retool the controls a bit, but aside from an extensive reworking 

of the game mechanics and environments, I can't envision a drastic enough improvement to the game to warrant any significant 

attention.


<hr>
<h3>Someone needs a dictionary...</h3>
<p>


<b>
I just read the PSP article and i was wondering why you guys say stuff like "Its not like Sega, Bandai, SNK, Game Park, and 

NEC had quite the same amount of power at the time of their respective handheld releases..."? Those systems deserve no 

respect. Why do you say "respective handheld releases"? Those handhelds suck. Ive been hearing that lately on alot of gaming 

sites, when people refer to something no matter how crappy or insignificant it is they give it respect. I think its just like 

a habbit or something but you tell me. Alsois there any word on a new Game Boy coming out from Nintendo too? I know the SP 

just came out but I suspect in late 2004 or in 2005 another one would come out. 



</b><br>
<i>-jordan 
</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> <i>Respective</i> simply refers to the fact that each one of the companies in question released a handheld at 

a specific time; it's nothing more than being grammatically correct. You're confusing the word with <i>respectable</i>. As 

for a new iteration for the Game Boy, Nintendo will likely ready something to compete against Sony's PSP in late 2004 or 

early-to-mid 2005.

<h3>Miyamoto phonetics</h3>
<p>


<b>
I was wondering exactly how you pronounce the name of the legendary games 
creator Shigeru Miyamoto?  Maybe you could post an mp3 or something?
cheers and great site!


</b><br>
<i>~Darren
</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> I've always pronounced it SHEH-GEER-OO ME-YA-MO-TOE. I'm not sure if that's right or not, but it sounds good 

to me!

<p><b>Dean:</b> Okay here we go<bR><br>
<b>Shigeru</b>: <i>Sha-ge-ro</i> (the She is like saying porche like por-sha)<br>
<b>Miyamoto</b>: Me-Ya-Mo-Toe<br><br>
And that sir, is the correct way! Josh is just plain ol' wrong. Well, 'cept for the last name.

<p><b>Cory:</b> You're both nuts.  <I>She-gay-ru Me-ya-mo-toe</I>.  With the "ru" pronounced as a conglomeration of "ru", "lu", and "du".  Try sticking your tongue in the back of your throat before that syllable and half-rolling the r.  Simple Japanese pronounciation, boyos.
