Today's Smash Bros. Dojo update revealed a feature that is sure to make many a fan extremely happy. <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> will allow players to build their very own stages! Hopefully this will entice some of the more creative people out there into building some truly unique stages.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Start by choosing the size, background, and music of your choice.</li>
  <li>Once on the editing screen, choose parts from the palette. Flip pieces, change their size, zoom in and out, and swap palettes, among other things.</li>
  <li>The stage editor is compatible with SD cards&mdash;save as many stages as you like!</li>
  <li>Share stages with friends by registering them with both the Wii System and SSBB friend codes.</li>
  <li>Submit stages to Nintendo, and they will choose one stage a day to send to everyone. The stages will disappear after the day is over. Players can also submit their Snapshots in a similar fashion.</li>
  <li>Sakurai and his team are striving to take advantage of WFC in more ways than just battling, and sharing is a key part of that strategy.</li>
  </ul><br />
