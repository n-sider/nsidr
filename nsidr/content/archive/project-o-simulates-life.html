The latest Famitsu features an <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/809/809780p1.html">interview</a> with  <i>Project O</i> game designer Norikazu Yasunaga and programming director Yoichi Kawaguchi. Until now, not much was known about the enigmatic title, except that it is being developed by CING and Marvelous Interactive and the focus is a growing town surrounded by a wilderness filled with monsters.<br />
<br />
This interview is about "life simulation," which plays a very large part in Project O. Each and every person in the town has their own individual personality&mdash;their own life, their own reactions, and their own memories. Yasunaga contrasted Project O's life simulation to his previous project, <i>World Neverland</i> which only had one AI routine for every person. Unlike World Neverland, however, Project O will feature a unique AI for all of the different professions.<br />

Despite this new revelation, the developers still have yet to reveal the most important detail of any game: how will the player actually interact with the game? They promise specific details next month at the Tokyo Game Show.
