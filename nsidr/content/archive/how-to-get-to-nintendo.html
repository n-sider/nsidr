<p>Kotaku has <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/feature/how-to-visit-nintendo-155964.php">a photo tour and directions</a> for the Nintendo fan on their own pilgrimage, as it were, with the goal of seeing the hallowed halls of Nintendo's headquarters.</p>

<p>Of course, the writer doesn't actually go <em>inside</em> the buildings; but it's an interesting tour anyway.  Also pictured: how to get to Nintendo's research center.</p>
