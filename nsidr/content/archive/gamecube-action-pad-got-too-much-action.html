Have you already worn out the <i>Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</i> GameCube Action Pad with your sweet moves?  Although the Action Pad is only bundled with the game in-store, all you stylish dancers can acquire a replacement or new Pad through Nintendo's toll-free number at 1-800-255-3700.  The part number is 59730 and the price is $19.99 (tax and shipping not included - UPS Ground within the U.S. is $5.00).
 
<br><br>A gracious thanks for the heads up, Jason.
