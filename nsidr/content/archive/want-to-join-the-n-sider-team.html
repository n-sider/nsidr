Are you interested in joining N-Sider's family of writers and contributors?  We're looking for dedicated folks with whom we will beef up our news team, and to that end, we'll be holding news tryouts.<br />
<br />
Applicants should first introduce themselves, explaining why they're interested in writing for N-Sider and providing some examples of their prior experience.  This should be sent to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=40">Mattie Behrens</a>, Norfair Content Lead.  If we think you might be N-Sider material, we'll invite you to participate in the tryouts.<br />
<br />
The tryouts will consist of one solid week of submitting news stories via e-mail.  Applicants' efforts will be judged on several criteria, including but not limited to:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Verifiability and accuracy</li>
  <li>Writing quality</li>
  <li>Regularity of contributions</li>
  <li>Timeliness</li>
  <li>Investigation</li>
  </ul><br />
Our hope is to hire writers who will have a committed spirit to making N-Sider News a robust source of information, with a free and available schedule and the desire to distill the oft-noisy sources of gaming news into high-quality contributions.  If you think you've got what it takes, contact Matt today!<br />
<br />
<span class="size_1">Positions at N-Sider are unpaid, and we reserve the right to hire absolutely nobody if we so desire.  Tryout contributions become the property of N-Sider and may be used for any purpose we see fit without any further compensation, though it is our intent that quality contributions be published as N-Sider News during the tryout period with proper credit given.  New hires will be classified freelance staff for a period of one month, at which time we will upgrade their status to resident staff, assuming they remain quality contributors.</span>
