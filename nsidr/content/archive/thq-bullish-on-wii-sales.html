In their Q2 results conference call, THQ CEO Brian Farrell has indicated his company <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20855">predicts strong sales for Wii</a>, expecting Nintendo's upcoming home console to "reach a multi-million installed base quickly".<br />
<br />
Farrell also said that THQ has more Wii titles in the works that the company plans to release in their 2008 fiscal year.  When asked about Sony's upcoming PlayStation 3, GamesIndustry.biz noted Farrell seemed "more cautious", indicating an attitude of wait-and-see, opting to release more titles "as its installed base grows in calendar 2007."
