Last Friday, Europe reached its 100th Virtual Console release&mdash;less than three weeks after North America <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2829">achieved</a> the same milestone.<br />
<br />
Europe's new games are as follows:<br />

  <li><i>J.J. & Jeff</i> (TurboGrafx-16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
North America will see these three new additions to the Virtual Console:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>NES Open Tournament Golf</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>World Sports Competition</i> (TurboGrafx-16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Bloody Wolf</i> (TurboGrafx-16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
