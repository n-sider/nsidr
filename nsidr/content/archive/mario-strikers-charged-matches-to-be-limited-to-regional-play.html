For the upcoming Wii entry in the Mario Strikers series, <i>Mario Strikers Charged</i>, the developers have made a decision to limit the capabilities of the game's online play via the Wi-Fi Connection a little.<br />
<br />
Mike Inglehart of Next Level, the company developing the title for Nintendo, explained in an interview with the UK's Official Nintendo Magazine that due to their desire to get a "quality gameplay experience", online matches <a href="http://gonintendo.com/?p=16658">will be region-specific</a>.  "The game is very twitch based and reactive," Inglehart explained, "so it's important for us to keep lag to a minimum."<br />
<br />
Commenters on the Go Nintendo blog, where the portion of the interview containing Inglehart's statement was posted, claim the region limitation is only for random matches, and not for matches with friends&mdash;these will presumably still work worldwide.  At the moment we can't verify whether this particular statement is true, though, so take it with a grain of salt.
