<p>Join us as we reminisce on our experiences from this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo.  Before sampling the insanity, however, take a gander at our <i>mostly</i> accurate tour of Nintendo's booth from the show.  Mapped out by Ricardo Arenas and rendered in interactive 3D by Dean Bergmann, the booth map will give you a good idea of how things were laid out on the show floor.  You'll need the latest version of the Macromedia Flash browser plugin to view the floor plan, which you can get <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" target="new">here</a>.</p>

"These people don't play games at E3.  I feel like I should tell you up front.  We're friends and all, so I figured it would fit for me to let you in on that particular secret.  People don't play games at E3.  People watch other people play games at E3..."

Im not much of a make-my-way-through-a-crowd person, so I got separated from the group. As I waited there in the crowd there was, whom I think were Germans, to the right of me..."
