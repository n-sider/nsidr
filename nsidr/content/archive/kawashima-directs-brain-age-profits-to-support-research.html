Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, represented polygonally in Nintendo DS juggernauts <i>Brain Age</i> and <i>Brain Age 2</i>, opts not to take his share of the profits from the games&#8212;instead directing them to support research at the university where he's employed.<br />
<br />
"Not a single yen has gone in my pocket," Kawashima says, explaining he'd rather keep up his research rather than live a life of idle luxury.  "Everyone in my family is mad at me but I tell them that if they want money, go out and earn it."<br />
<br />
Kawashima's current work has him at Japan's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=3051">only Nintendo-beating company</a> Toyota, working on ways to help elderly drivers keep alert to avoid accidents.<br />
