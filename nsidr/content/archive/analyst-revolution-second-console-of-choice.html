<p>At the Games Marketing Conference in San Francisco yesterday, Wedbush Morgan Securities' managing director of research Michael Pachter had <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/03/08/nintendo-revolution-prediction-second-console-of-choice/">some good words</a> for Nintendo's "second console" strategy: he feels it will work.</p>

<p>"People have written off the Revolution and that's foolish," Pachter says.  He claims Xbox 360 and PS3 will have very little to differentiate themselves from each other, and so multi-platform homes will have a 360 <em>or</em> a PS3, then add a Revolution because of the unique gameplay that will only be available on that platform.  "You're going to see the Revolution as the second console of choice in the household," he concludes.</p>
