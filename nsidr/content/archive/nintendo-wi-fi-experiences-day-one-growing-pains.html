<p>GameSpot, along with other news outlets, is <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6139894.html">reporting on Wi-Fi Connection difficulties</a> experienced the first night <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874">Mario Kart DS</a> became generally available, leading Nintendo to post on <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/">their Wi-Fi Connection website</a> that <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/MarioKartGamingHub.jsp">the Mario Kart hub</a> was "experiencing intermittent problems".</p>

<p>We here at N-Sider also noticed some problems with the system; members of our staff who have been playing advance copies for the past several days noticed a decidedly less-stable system last night.  Hopefully these are just growing pains, and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection will be able to offer stable service to all comers in the very near future.</p>
