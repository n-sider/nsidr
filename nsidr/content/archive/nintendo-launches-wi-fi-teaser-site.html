<p>Nintendo of America has launched a teaser site that Nintendo-watchers will have their eyes on for some time.  <a href="http://nintendowifi.com/">NintendoWiFi.com</a> currently consists of a spinning Wi-Fi logo, the words "Coming in November", and a button to take you to their main site at <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo.com</a>, but will likely be a part of their bigger Wi-Fi advertising push in the near future.</p>
