<p>Nintendo Gal has noticed that <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/888-No-More-Component-Cables.html">Nintendo is no longer selling component cables</a> for the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=11">Nintendo GameCube</a>.  The cables were previously frequently on back order, leaving those looking for the cable set to find other options such as used and third-party cables.</p>

<p>GameCubes sold since May 2004 have not actually featured a port compatible with the cable set, anyway.  At that time, Nintendo determined that <a href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=9434">less than 1% of GameCube owners</a> were making use of the component video output port, and dropped it entirely, renumbering the system to DOL-101 from its previous incarnation as DOL-001.</p>

<p>Nintendo has not yet said whether GameCube successor <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> will feature component output, but photos of the system seem to indicate that its A/V port is entirely different than the GameCube's standard A/V port, which has remained the same since its introduction with the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=5">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>.  It's possible that Nintendo may be offering an all-in-one composite/component video solution with the new system, especially considering the increasing prevalence of sets with component options.</p>
