Last week, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/wii-update-bricking-some-systemsaeur-even-unmodified-ones">as we reported</a>, Nintendo rolled out a Wii system update with the intent to remove and ultimately prevent the Homebrew Channel (and other modifications) from running on Wii systems.  Unfortunately for Nintendo, a few systems that had never been tampered with were being affected by this update, rendering them unusable.<br />
<br />
When the story broke, we asked Nintendo if they'd comment, and they were kind enough to provide an official response to these issues.  The following is from Charlie Scibetta, Senior Director, Corporate Communications:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">Nintendo of America's consumer service department has received less than 200 inquiries regarding system menu update (SMU) 4.2 since it launched on September 28, 2009.   <br />
<br />
This is from a U.S. installed base of over 21,000,000 Wii consoles.  A significant number of these inquiries were resolved quickly and easily right over the phone.  For the remaining inquiries we have advised consumers that the symptoms described usually occur when a Wii console has been modified.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who owns Wii hardware with unauthorized technical modifications may face hardware inoperability after downloading SMU 4.2.  As always, if anyone is experiencing problems with their Wii console after downloading any SMU please contact Nintendo consumer service at 1-800-255-3700.</div><br />
Since we originally reported on the issue, there was briefly a post on Nintendo's own tech forums that offered a free fix (see the updates to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/wii-update-bricking-some-systemsaeur-even-unmodified-ones">our original story</a> for details), but that's since been edited into the more general message: if you had trouble with the update, call Nintendo.
