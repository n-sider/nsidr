<p>Nintendo will establish a film production team within the Nintendo company instead of pursuing an investment partnership strategy, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun.</p>

<p>In September, former Nintendo Co., Ltd. president and board member Hiroshi Yamauchi, announced he would propose to Nintendo's board of directors the idea for Nintendo to enter the animated film business.  A decision has been made by the company's management to pursue such a venture.  One of the first films suspected to begin development will be based on the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, a collection of Japanese poems from between the 7th and 13th centuries.  The first film is currently scheduled to release in 2006.</p>
