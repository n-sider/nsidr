The latest edition of the Japanese magazine <i>Famitsu</i> has revealed three new games for Nintendo systems.<br />
<br />
First up is a DS remake of the classic Breakout clone, <i>Arkanoid DS</i>. Not to be one-upped by the unique <i>Nervous Brickdown</i>, Arkanoid DS will come with a <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-2991-5.jpg">paddle</a>&mdash;not unlike the old Atari paddle controllers&mdash;that plugs into the GBA slot. The gameplay spans both screens, and features the classic Arkanoid style of levels many have grown to love.<br />
<br />
The second game announced is being developed by Million and published by Arc System Works. It is a sequel to the Game Boy Advance game <i>Super Dodge Ball Advance</i>. The <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-2991-1.jpg">two</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-2991-2.jpg">pages</a> in Famitsu that revealed <i>Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball DS</i> gave some details on features new to the DS sequel. The game will have single-cart local multiplayer for up to eight people in three different modes. Unfortunately, no online mode was revealed.<br />
<br />
Finally, the third game is for Wii and is titled <i>Puchicopter</i>. From <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-2991-3.jpg">the</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-2991-4.jpg">scans</a> it looks like you control different RC 'copters through various environments. The two shown in the screenshots appear to be a park and a room inside a building&mdash;maybe a doctor's office?<br />
<br />
None of these games have yet received a Japanese release date.
