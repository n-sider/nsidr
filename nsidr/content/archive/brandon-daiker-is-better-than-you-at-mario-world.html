<p>As noted on <a href="http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&pi=32&gi=515&vi=9685">Twin Galaxies</a>, the self-proclaimed "Official Electronic Scoreboard" for the whole entire internet, N-Sider staffer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=11">Brandon "Where'd I Put My Pockets" Daiker</a> has achieved the third-fastest minimalist speed run in Super Mario World with a stunning time of 12 minutes and  14 seconds.</p>

<p>In a heavily censored post-race interview, Daiker was heard to say,</p>

<p><i>"I called the ****ing moles in that Super Mario World level ******* *** ******s when they kept trampling me.  It was pretty offensive, even to my own ears.  But I just kept saying it.  It was funny."</i></p>

<p>In a later exchange, Daiker also commented on his mechanical ingenuity.</p>

<p><i>"Zima is so ****ing lame that it's ****ing awesome.  It tastes like Sprite.  I drink it almost exclusively.  One time I was gettin mad busy and I wanted to get a zima without leaving but I didn't know how to do that so I built a robot to get it."</i></p>

<p>Daiker's speed run is, by the laws of statistics, likely much faster than yours.  It is also provably faster than those of the slower-minded N-Sider staff members, most notably one Jeffrey "Jeffery" Van Camp.</p>
