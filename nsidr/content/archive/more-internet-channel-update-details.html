Nintendo has released a few more details concerning the upcoming final version of Wii's Internet Channel, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2685">due in April</a>.<br />
<br />
The new channel's feature list includes improvements to zooming and scrolling, including an improved zoomed font; faster access to favorites and startup of the channel itself; the ability to hide the toolbar (useful for full-screen viewing of sites); and buttons to key in common phrases such as "www." and ".com".<br />
<br />
As previously mentioned, the final version will be available for download in April as a free update through the end of June.  After June, the Internet Channel will be available for 500 Wii Points.
