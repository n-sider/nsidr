I've said in both <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=653">my review</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=3180">my original impressions</a> that I wished <i>Wii Fit</i>'s weight charts had statistical smoothing, but not everyone really understands what that means.  Here's an illustration.<br />
<br />
I've been logging my weight simultaneously with <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/palm/">Eat Watch</a>, putting Wii Fit's poundage into my Palm after my daily weigh-ins, and this is the chart that results (minus the numbers&#8212;sorry, that's not my game):<br />

While there's a bit of a lag in the "trend" line, you can see that it's useful for helping to see the long-term view, illustrating one's trend rather than the mountainous ups-and-downs of day to day water retention, digestion changes, and stress.  Considering that any exercise program is going to work best over a long period of time, the trend line is very helpful in focusing on the eventual goal over daily variations&#8212;something that Wii Fit really should have taken into account, I feel.
