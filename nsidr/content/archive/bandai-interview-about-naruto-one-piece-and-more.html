<blockquote><font size="2">GD: My next question is regarding the Bandai/Namco deal. How will this relationship between Bandai and Namco affect Bandai software releases here in the US and in Japan? Will it have any affect at all?
<br><br>
Laura: That's a tough question. Right now, we don't have any information, anything more than what has been released, which was the Bandai/Namco merger was done to improve the standing of both companies in the market and sets us up better to compete in the marketplace with the next generation consoles. In terms of how it's going to affect Bandai Games and Namco's future releases, I don't have any more information on that at this point.
