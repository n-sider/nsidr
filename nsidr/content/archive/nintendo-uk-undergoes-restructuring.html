Nintendo UK said it will undergo major restructuring to improve its working relations with trade partners, according to MCV. As part of this, Nintendo UK general manager David Yarnton said the company will now assume responsibility for Scandinavian operations.<br>

<blockquote><font size="2">"Since I have been here weve been working to implement improvements in the way we service and work with our business partners and to be more responsive and proactive in driving our business together in a more positive direction," said Yarnton in a letter.  "The changes will see greater clarity and focus for our NUK team and give clear delineation of responsibilities and reporting lines. However, I will not be reducing my active involvement in the business and hope to actually provide more quality time that I can spend on strategic issues with you."

According to MCV, Dawn Paine becomes UK marketing director at the firm, unifying all marketing activity. Former head of retail development Andy Yates becomes UK sales director.  Tom Pearce moves from finance and commercial controller to the role of finance director, while Philip Stephens switches from retail development manager to work under Paine as trade and promotions marketing manager, and Ian McMillan becomes trade and merchandising manager, from a stint as retail development controller.  Finally, former national account controller Darren Gorton assumes the new role of senior manager of associated markets and strategic partnerships. Gorton will oversee Nintendos Scandinavian distributor Bergsala, in addition to taking on responsibility for third-party publisher relations.
