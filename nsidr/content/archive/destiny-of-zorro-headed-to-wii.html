If you've ever held your Wii Remote out in front of you and slashed Zorro's trademark move in the air, Pronto Games may have <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/news/6843/1/Wii-Exclusive_Zorro_Details_and_Screens">just the title for you</a>.  <i>The Destiny of Zorro</i> puts players in the shoes of Don Diego de la Vega a.k.a. Zorro in 1800's Spanish California, whipping, slicing, and of course doing the big old Z in the air to finish off your foes.<br />
<br />
The Destiny of Zorro is scheduled for a late 2007 release.
