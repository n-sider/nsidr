With all that behind us, the week was finally coming to a close.  While there were some highlights (Matt in particular enjoyed playing a number of the wackier games on display at Barker), we were ready to go home&mdash;the tedium of constant shuttling was seriously tiring us out, as well as just screwing up our schedules in general.  We topped our week off with meetings with Konami and Nyko, and prepared to go home...<br />

We had a ton of play-time with Mario Galaxy which has gotten five times sweeter since last year, and some fun with Metroid and the upcoming Mario Strikers Charged.  Went and checked out Spyro for the Wii behind closed doors over at Vivendi, too.  Now for some food and then later to Konami and a meeting with Nyko!  Stay tuned kiddies!<br />

E3's all of a sudden just about over with a Konami meeting and a couple of hours left at Barker Hangar...<br />

We're off to Japan Town for some delicious foods and a last evening out before we all head out tomorrow.

Thanks for reading!<br />

We hope you enjoyed this little journey with us into our time at the 2007 E3 Media & Business Summit; we certainly did enjoy taking you with us.  Stay tuned to N-Sider for the promised upcoming in-depths and more impressions as we work through both our still-troubling misaligned sleep patterns and the scads of notes we took.
