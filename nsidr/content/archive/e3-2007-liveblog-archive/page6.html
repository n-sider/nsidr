Thursday was a brand-new day.  Nintendo of America had invited us back into their suite for some playtime with <i>Wii Fit</i> and <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>, and we had a visit scheduled with our friends at Atlus to see their wonderfully wacky assortment of releases.  In-between we strolled through Barker Hangar to check out what was around.  Capping off the day was an invite, strangely enough, not to any sort of Nintendo-related party, but Microsoft's C3 party at the fully-Microsoft-rented Viceroy hotel...<br />

Today we have our interview hitting the site as well as various impressions of some of the Wii and DS games that scattered the Barker Hangar.  Later on today we'll have more playtime with the Barker Hangar games, a meeting with Atlus, and extended play sessions with Super Mario Galaxy, Wii Fit, Phantom Hourglass, and other first-party Nintendo titles.  Stay tuned for the passion, the heartache, the triumph, the disappointment, and... the <i>joy</i>.<br />

There are rumblings of going to the Home of the Beef Bowl for lunch.  I heard it was actually a bowl made entirely out of beef like a bread bowl but beefy.  It's just the word on the street.<br />

We just got done with Nintendo's play session and we're on the way to Barker for some more hands-on.  Got some good time in with Wii Fit, Flash Focus, Mario Galaxy, and Metroid Prime 3.  More from the show floor!<br />

Trauma Center: New Blood looks pretty cool and has a Wi-Fi score ranking, got a couple quirky Japanese fighting/rhythm games and they're giving out little pens that look like syringes.  A little more playtime here and we're out to the Fairmont, dinner, and later the Microsoft C3 event.<br />

We ran into Peter Moore, and tons of other important people, such as Major Nelson.<br />
<br />
Pictured left is Brandon and I with Peter Moore, moments before we told him we worked for a Nintendo site, to which he replied: "Oh, so you drink our drinks and eat our food.. Go play our games or be on your way!"<br />
<br />
We told him we would do so, but before departing he said: "Say hi to Reggie for me."<br />
<br />
Good times tonight.<br />
