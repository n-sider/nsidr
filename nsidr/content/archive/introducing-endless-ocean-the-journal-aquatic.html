In celebration of the upcoming release of <i>Endless Ocean: Blue World</i>, Amber, Brenden, Dean and Matt are going to be posting daily in-character journals of our dives into the game's many oceans, pairing up regularly to explore the deep waters together using the game's support for the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  And, of course, we'll take pictures&mdash;lots of pictures.<br />
<br />
Come back on Monday for our kickoff post, and return every weekday for the next two weeks, right on through the game's release on February 22 and wrapping up on February 26.
