Among other tales of record high game sales in Japan comes the news that the latest entry in the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/games.php?view=browse&filter=series&group=60">Wii franchise</a> has hit a million in sales.<br />
<br />
<i>Wii Fit</i>, which sells for roughly $80 in Nintendo's home country, comes with the Balance Board peripheral that can sense pressure in ways that permit it to measure weight as well as the direction the player is leaning, has been one of the bigger sellers in Japan, lifting briefly-stagnant Wii sales in that country back into six figures since its release.<br />
<br />
<i>Wii Sports</i>, which is sold separately in Japan instead of being bundled separately, was the top-selling title with 1.9 million copies sold&#8212;an impressive feat for a title which was actually released in 2006.<br />
