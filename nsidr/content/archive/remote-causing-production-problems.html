<p>According to <a href="http://gonintendo.com/?p=5146">an English translation</a> of a PCGames.com.cn story, the Wii's Remote may be <a href="http://www.pcgames.com.cn/tvgames/topic/psp/information/otherinf/0608/815722_1.html">experiencing production problems</a>.</p>

<p>The translation, provided by a GoNintendo reader, says the Remote and nunchaku attachment "still have a lot of small issues, such as buttons aren't sensitive, hard to press 2 buttons together, and even no response occasionally, and the current sample is easy to get damaged, using the controller in normal situation will produce some noise, etc."</p>

<p>The article also says the Remote uses Bluetooth for data transfer, which Nintendo has previously confirmed; and infrared for determining the Remote's position in space, which has been suspected by some Wii-watchers.</p>

<P>The factory is said to be working with Nintendo to iron out the issues, but site-verified samples must be sent to NCL in Japan because the factory does not possess Wii hardware to test with.  The article speculates that not ironing out these problems may cause problems for Nintendo's Q4 launch, which may be why Nintendo has not yet committed to launch dates and lineups.</p>
