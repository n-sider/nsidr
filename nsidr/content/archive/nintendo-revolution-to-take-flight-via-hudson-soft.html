"Flight Game" - Nintendo Revolution - Take to the skies in a way never before experienced on any home console.

<p>Flying games is new territory for the company.  Hudson is a Japanese developer recognized for its Bomberman series of multiplayer games.  As you may <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1871">recall</a> at the March 2006 Game Developer Conference, Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> revealed  that Hudson will bring to the Nintendo Revolution Virtual Console some of the best games released for the TurboGrafx.  The TurboGrafx console launched in the early 1990s and although it sold dismally, it became known for titles such as Bomberman and Bonk's Adventure.  The studio has been under financial pressure recently with Konami spending more than $13 million in 2005 to become the company's majority shareholder.  It seems Hudson may see the Revolution as benefiting to its future.</p>
