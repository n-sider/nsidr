<p>GameDaily BIZ has <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/adwatch/?id=12247">an interview with Abby Lovett of Leo Burnett USA</a>, discussing the advertising the company brought to the TV screen for Nintendo's recent Wi-Fi Connection title <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=995"><i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i></a>.</p>

<p>Lovett stresses that the key ingredient to the ad was having members on the team who appreciated the game.  "Our teams are huge fans of the Metroid franchise and this game in particular," she said. "It would be impossible to create advertising like this unless you were a fan of the game."</p>

<p><a href="http://media.nintendo.com/mediaFiles/Qehvqma12-QdrV5-daAEICMgYXz3dzcg.mov">The ad</a> features a decidedly dark tone, emphasizing the "kill or be killed" nature of the game.  "'More bounty hunters...more ways to die' demonstrates that the franchise has taken a new turn," Lovett explained, "with the added ability to play as multiple bounty hunters via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection."</p>

<p><i>Hunters</i> is currently available for the Nintendo DS, and of course we've got several players sharing their codes and <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=3114">discussing the game</a> over in our forums.</p>
