Upcoming piracy-themed Wii adventure <i>Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure</i> has acquired a very useful feature for those who want to play it with friends or family: players 2-4 can use their Remotes to point at and <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/09/hands-on-zack-a.html">draw doodles on</a> the screen while player 1 tackles the game.<br />
<br />
Wired's Emily Balistrieri, reporting on the feature from the ongoing Tokyo Game Show, noted that the scribbles themselves are even stylish, hanging "in the 3-D world like freaky space noodles and not just paint slapped on your TV screen".  They don't stick around long enough for you to write out full words, but they're nonetheless a great addition for those who want to help (or possibly hinder).<br />

Zack & Wiki hits North American retail first this coming October 16, followed the week after by Europe on the 23rd and Japan on December 7.
