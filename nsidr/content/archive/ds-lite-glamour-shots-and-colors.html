<p>After <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1728">yesterday's FCC application</a> showing the Lite in harsh, yellowing light was swarmed over by the collective forces of the Internet, Nintendo perhaps felt the need to unveil some more, much more flattering pictures of the unit at <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/lite/">its official Japanese site</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-02-10-ds_lite_colors.jpg" alt="Japanese Nintendo DS Lite colors: Crystal White, Ice Blue, Enamel Navy"></p>

<p>Nintendo also took the opportunity to announce the three Japanese launch colors: Crystal White, Ice Blue, and Enamel Navy.  If history is any indication, we probably won't see more than one of these colors grace North American shores; Nintendo of America, probably correctly, generally decides their audience has far different tastes than the buyers in the Land of the Rising Sun.  Still, I'm hoping for Crystal White, myself.</p>
