ionForge said it will offer developers a tool that will enable them to keep track of subtle image changes throughout the development cycle.  The tool called imageDiff works with such platforms as the Nintendo DS.  imageDiff is a visual comparison image software tool that the company offers as a free download to designers and artists.  More information can be found at the official <a href="http://www.imagediff.com">website</a>.<br>

"Visual image comparison is going to dramatically improve the development cycle of game design and entertainment projects," noted Lucas Heneks, Lead Developer of Entertainment and Game Tools for ionForge. "With imageDiff you can compare two images side by side, and see a difference mask that shows you the exact pixels that changed. We see this as a major advancement in source control and configuration management."
