<p>N-Sider was recently inspired by the mischievous King Bowser to kidnap Princess Peach of the Mushroom Kingdom.  Don't get us wrong though.  We had good intentions (for the most part).  Although we did lock her in our basement for a week with only a measuring cup, jelly beans and bowl, we were able to manifest one (no wait, two) incredibly delicious cakes for our birthday boy, Mr. <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>.</p>

<p>Happy birthday, Miyamoto!  From the bottom of our hearts.  The N-Sider staff would like to thank Miyamoto for his immeasurable contributions to not only the realm of video games but our very own lives.  From Mario, to Donkey Kong, to Zelda and beyond, you've brought joy and inspiration to children and adults around the world.</p>
