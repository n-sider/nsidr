<p>As a member of the N-Sider LA team for this year's E3 coverage (and, subsequently, a member of the "I took my finals a week early and lived to tell the tale" team), I was able to visit both the LACC and Kodak Theatre to do a little behind-the-scenes research. What did I discover? Keep reading to find out.</p>

<p>First of all, let me just say that pictures and video of the venue don't really do it justice -- this thing is huge. If a Walmart Supercenter and Tamba Bay Stadium had a baby (yup... I just assigned natural functions of the living to inanimate objects), it'd probably look alot like the Los Angeles Convention Center. That said, it was a bit intimidating to see the sun eclipsed by its massive front before I was even on the same block.</p>

<p>As I approached the front entrance I was met by a group of contracters. My first thought was that they'd seen me taking pictures and had decided to use their lunch break pounding my camera into the concrete.</p>

<p>C'mon, guys; first one to split the CCD gets a slice of pizza on me!</p>

<p>But that wasn't the case at all. In fact, they were very nice people, and just happened to be the team solely responsible for setting up Nintendo's show-floor equipment -- this covered everything from posters to kiosks, according to their lead guy. Unfortunatly, they were pretty tight-lipped regarding the specifics of said units.</p>

<p>I managed to get inside and see how work was progressing for the show -- pretty exciting. G4 TV's micro-studio on the left... okay, that's cool -- why are there 5 or 6 manikins just chillin' outside their booth? Your guess is as good as mine. At least they're wearing clothes.</p>

<p>A stack of flight-cases with the words "NEC 50-INCH PLASMA" stenciled on the sides... that's always cool. They could show a 72-hour marathon of <i>Con Air</i> on those things and I'd be happy to watch it.</p>

<p>Ah, here we go; there's a... no, wait -- that's just someone coming to kick me out. I won't have my press-badge until the rest of our team arrives on Monday. Rats.</p>

<p>After getting an advance taste of E3 at the convention center, I figured I'd cruise over to the Kodak Theatre and see what was cooking there.</p>

<p>Yet, much to my surprise, one wouldn't know anything was happening at all on May 9th if they didn't follow the biz -- the information office denied any knowledge of Nintendo having a press conference on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"Something like that would probably be happening in the Renaissance hotel, actually; you might wanna' check there", they said.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

<p>I walked outside after grabbing a few pamphlets and continued down the street toward the Chinese Theater -- I'd always wanted to see the star's handprints, after all -- when I saw something interesting:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news--5-06-2006-kodak6.jpg"></p>

<p>Keep in mind: this is written on a sign directly across the street from the Kodak Theatre. Coincidence? Viral marketing scheme? A simple gesture to the many fans and professionals who've followed this system from conception to product? I aimed to find out.</p>

<p>It was almost completely dark in the Roosevelt hotel. This is a very upper-class establishment, you see -- everyone's dressed like they're going to the Academy Awards -- and if you're caught so much as <i>looking</i> like you'd have a problem pulling out Ben Franklins to tip the concierge, they'll likely lynch you in the piano bar for the sake of entertaining wealthier guests. I had a camera around my neck; that was probably my only escape.</p>

<p>After finding my way to the front desk and speaking with a "customer service professional" about the message on their sign (among other things), I was able to confirm that Nintendo would indeed have a "strong executive presence at the hotel throughout next week".</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>I guess it's worth noting that after digging a bit further, I was able to uncover the fact that this particular hotel (as well as partnering Thompson hotels in Soho, New York City and Seattle) offers a Nintendo game service in every room.</p>
