<p>After <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2420">breaking the earlier news</a> that Wii was apparently mostly region-free, Wired News has issued <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/index.blog?entry_id=1557909">an update</a> indicating the opposite.</p>

<p>Nintendo's official line now is that Wii is not region-free, nor is its own first-party software.  We'll know for sure when the console releases in the U.S. November 19.</p>
