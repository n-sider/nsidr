<p>Developer Q-games and Nintendo may have a software or technology project in the works, according to a hint in a recent interview with <a href="http://gc.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=4203">GCAdvanced.com</a>.  Q-games is home to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=15">Dylan Cuthbert</a> who was the main programmer of the original <i>Star Fox</i> for the Super Nintendo.</p>

<blockquote>
<font size="2">

<p><b>AMN - What was it like working with Nintendo [on Star Fox]? Was it a positive or negative experience overall? (If positive) Would you consider working with Nintendo again in the future?</b></P>

<p><b>Dylan:</b> Extremely positive. I always enjoyed fiddling with stuff when making a game and Nintendo taught me how to fiddle with even more precision and self-criticism. Yes, I would definitely work with Nintendo again, and perhaps we already are... ;-)</p>

<p>In the past Q-games has created technical demonstrations (videos or demos) to show off the capabilities of both the Sony PlayStation 2 and PSP during their initial unveilings. Although nothing in the least has been confirmed, it's possible they may be working with Nintendo to create demos for the Revolution.</p>
