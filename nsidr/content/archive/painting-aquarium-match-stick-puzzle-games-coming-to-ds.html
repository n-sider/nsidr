Mercury Games has announced that it will be bringing ten titles from the Ertain's "Zen Series" of games for the Nintendo DS to markets in Europe and the United States.<br />
<br />
Mercury was tight-lipped as to what exactly the "Zen Series" consists of, but they did say it included "innovative painting games, puzzle games, and funky relaxing fish simulations"&mdash;which led us to <a href="http://www.ertain.com/en/products/game/index.html">these games</a>.  Though there are only six listed, and <i>Calligraphy DS</i> does not seem to be a candidate for localization, this is Ertain's Zen Series.<br />
<br />
<i>PaintPleasure</i> offers you the chance to become "a master painter" with your DS and stylus.  The title offers watercolor, oil painting, and coloring pencils, and will let you "remake some famous masterpieces".  <i>PaintPleasure for Boys: Tamiya Box Art</i> takes away the canvas and gives you model tanks and planes to paint instead.<br />
<br />
<i>Aquarium DS Real</i> and <i>Aquarium DS Fantasy</i> are sister titles that let you create your own aquariums within the confines of the DS.  The Real version gives you things you'd normally expect in an aquarium&mdash;pet fish (which you can care for), plant life, and aquarium decorations&mdash;while the Fantasy version sets you up with the chance to put creatures like whales, dolphins and penguins in your tank.  Both games offer the capability to share your fish with your friends.<br />
<br />
<i>Match Stick Puzzle</i> is a bit more of a traditional title, offering (as you might imagine) match stick puzzles, re-creating figures out of match sticks.  A time attack mode is present.<br />
<br />
Mercury intends to release all games in the Zen series in 2007.  What the other five are, they're not yet saying (and it's possible they may be referring to ten releases, spanning Europe and the U.S), but they've promised to reveal more details later.
