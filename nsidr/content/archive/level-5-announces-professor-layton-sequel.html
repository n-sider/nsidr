By way of Famitsu we have the announcement that Level 5, the folks behind <i>Dragon Quest IX</i>, are <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2007/02/15/104,1171517036,67161,0,0.html">hard at work on a sequel</a> to their other DS title, <i>Professor Layton and the Mysterious Village</i>.<br />
<br />
Little is yet known about <i>Professor Layton and the Devil's Box</i>, but it's safe to assume it shares similar gameplay to the original Layton title, where you're asked to solve a number of brain-teasing puzzles to advance the game's adventure mode.<br />
<br />
No release date for Devil's Box, either in Japan or outside, has yet been given.
