<p>Nintendo of America has announced that anyone who reserves a copy of <i>Pokemon Colosseum</i> before it hits shelves March 24th, will immediately recieve a bonus disc containing the following:

<ul>
<li><i>Pokemon Colosseum</i> Preview
<li>New Movie Sneak Peek
<li>A special download which allows you to add Jirachi to your <i>Pokemon Ruby</i> / <i>Saffire</i> collection.
  </ul>

<p>For those unaware, <i>Pokemon Colosseum</i> is an upcoming game for the GameCube, in the same vein as <i>Pokemon Stadium</i> for the Nintendo 64. A notable difference, however, is that the game will actually contain a fully 3D single player campaign.
