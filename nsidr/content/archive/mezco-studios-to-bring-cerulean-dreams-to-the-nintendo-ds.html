<p>MezCo Studios said it will transfer development of its Game Boy Advance shooter called <i>Cerulean Dreams</i> to the new Nintendo DS handheld.  Some of the new features of the game are as follows:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Flight-combat stages will now use 3D models for main ship sprites, enemy sprites, and some obstacle/terrain items. 
<li>All HUD information will be displayed on the touch sensitive screen, and all standard gameplay will be displayed on the other. 
<li>The menus on the touch screen can be scrolled through and accessed while the game is going, or while it is paused, giving you more "quick and active" control over the game as you play 
<li>New functions will be added that allow you to better control your ships functionality. This one I can't expand upon more than that, but let's just say the touch sensitivity will be utilized, and it will add a lot more depth to gameplay. 
<li>Multiplayer co-op will be completely possible. Previously, our plan was to allow multiplayer minigames and boss battles. GBA limitations didn't allow us to easily do a cooperative story mode. However, the DS changes all this, and you'll be able to play through the main game with your friends along for the ride. Wireless access makes it even better.</ul></p>
