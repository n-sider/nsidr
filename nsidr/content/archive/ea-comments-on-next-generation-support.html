David Gardner, EA senior vice president of international publishing, spoke with Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu and said his company would focus next-generation game development on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.  Although his comments may have been muddled in translation, it's likely the case that EA will take the same approach it has this generation, which has seen the company releasing the majority of its titles on PlayStation 2 and Xbox and only selecting for release those games it feels will sell on GameCube.  Electronic Arts has already said it will support all three next-generation consoles including the Nintendo Revolution.  Furthermore, the company has a history of providing the majority of its software for multiplatform release.
