In addition to the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2618">recently-announced</a> <i>Dewy's Adventure</i>, word from the weekend is that Konami is also <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/wii/puzzle/ddrhottestparty/news.html?page=1&sid=6165243">bringing a Dance Dance Revolution game to Wii</a>&mdash;and unlike the constantly-sold-out DDR game Konami and Nintendo brought to GameCube, this one has Mario nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
<i>Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party</i> takes the traditional DDR party and adds one twist: not only do your feet move on the mat, but the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers in your hands move as well.  The dance mat plugs into the GameCube controller ports on the system instead of taking the wireless avenue, presumably meaning that your Action Pad from <i>Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix</i> will be usable.  Konami is experimenting with a number of ideas including "throwing" arrows with the Wii Remote at other players and the possibility of "flair" moves with the handheld controllers.<br />
<br />
Hottest Party is most likely headed for Wii this year, but the title is still in development, so stay tuned.
