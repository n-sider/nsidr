<p>Sega announced today that everyone's favorite blue hedgehog will make an appearance on Nintnedo Wii.  This new adventure, tentatively titled Sonic Wild Fire, will be a solo outing based on the classic Arabian Nights story.  It seems that several pages of the book have disappeared and it is up to Sonic to fill them back in.</p>

<p>The game will use the Wii controller in a horizontal fashion, where you will tilt the controller left and right to steer sonic, similar to using a racing wheel.  You can perform dash attacks by quickly tilting the controller forward.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6149640.html">Gamespot</a>, there will also be an array of minigames bundled in which focus on the motion capabilities of the Wii controller.  While an exact release date for Wild Fire has not been set, the game is expected to come out sometime in 2007.</p>
