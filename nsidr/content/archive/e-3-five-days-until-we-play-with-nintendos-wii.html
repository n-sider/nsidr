<p>When you get a staff together as charismatic and quirky as the N-Sider editorial crew, there's always bound to be misadventures whenever we're able to all be in one place at one time. Usually it comes in the form of everyone being fired repeatedly, or spouting catch phrases from long lost childhood TV shows; but every year there always seems to be one staff event that sticks out for everyone.</p>
<p>In today's look back, Ricardo <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-2005-a-retrospective/4">recollects</a> on our adventures with Star Wars in 2005: </p>

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>Since we were going to go see Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of  the Sith which was at 5:15pm, we had to leave the Convention Center  early. We had planned to meet up at the Media Center at 3:30pm. But  since it was several of us, it took a while for us to get together and  leave the convention center. But before we could go to the theater we  had to stop by the hotel to drop off our swag bags and other things. We  took a bit longer than expected and ended up leaving the hotel for the  subway around 4:30pm.</p>
      <p>As we were buying our tickets for the subway a bum appeared out of  nowhere asking us to buy his subway ticket for a dollar rather than the  three dollars needed to purchase from the machine. I was able to get my  ticket quickly but some of the others were having trouble with the  machines -- some didnt have exact change while others were being  hassled by the bum.</p>
      <p>As the others were still purchasing their tickets Dean, Amanda  (Dean's girlfriend) and myself decided to go on ahead downstairs to the  subway. But as we were going down the stairs we could hear off in the  distance that the subway train was approaching. We hurried down the  stairs and were really worried that the rest of the group wasnt going  to make it. As we could feel and hear the subway getting closer I  decided to run back up stairs and see what was taking everyone else so  long. As I reached the top of the stairs I saw Adrian DeHerrera (new  staffer) running towards the stairs on the other side but abruptly turn  around and run back the other way. </p>
      <p>By then the subway train was only a few feet away, so I turned  around and ran back down the stairs and got in. Dean was pretty upset  saying it was their fault for taking so long. I felt bad for leaving  them behind but I didnt want to miss the movie. As we rode on the  subway in silence Dean all of a sudden realized that we had missed our  stop and the subway train we were on was going to a dead end. Thats  instant karma right there for ya, huh? Heh. So what we needed to do was  that, at the next stop we would get on the subway going back and at the  previous station we would able to catch another subway, going the  correct way. </p>
    <p>As we reached the stop the subway going the other way was already  there. It was truly agonizing waiting for the subway to come to a  complete halt for the doors to open. Finally, as the doors were opening  on our cart the doors on the subway train across from us were just  closing. Dean somehow called upon the powers of the Speed Force and  bolted like The Flash. This was all going in slow motion for me now. As  I was running behind I noticed I was falling behind so I kicked up a  gear and started to catch up. Ive never ran so fast in my life. Dean  just barely made it, jamming his foot between the doors preventing them  from closing. I was only a foot or two away from Dean when I slowed  down and slid and started to fall backwards. As I began to see the  ceiling and the lights above I somehow regained my balance. I swear, my  back went horizontal with the ground. I really dont know how I didnt  fall.</p></td>

<p>With all the staff (seven attendees staying in the hotel) in one room this year, it would be crazy to assume that our combined antics wouldn't rival that of a reality TV show such as Big Brother. Remember, you can watch our insanity rise throughout the week, and look back on the show with us as if you were actually there, if you pre-order our <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&amp;storyid=1915">E3 2006 DVD</a>. </p>
<p>For only $6 with free worldwide shipping, it's the cheapest way you'll ever get to see E3, and feel like you're right there with us as we take you through the unveiling of Nintendo's Wii, and plenty of other highlights from the show, and events surrounding it. </p>
