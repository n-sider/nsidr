Majesco Entertainment announced a new shooting game, <i>Blast Works: Build, Fuse, and Destroy</i>, for the Nintendo Wii.<br />
<br />
Apparently based on the PC game <a href="http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/windows/tf_e.html">TUMIKI Fighters</a> by Kenta Cho, Blast Works is a side-scrolling shooter being developed by Budcat Creations. The main draw for the game is the high level of customization that is expected. Players can craft their own levels and build their own ships and enemy ships. In addition, a "sticky" element to the game lets gamers absorb pieces and weapons from enemy ships to aid their own defenses in battle. <br />
<br />
The goal of the game is to destroy enemies and absorb their parts over 15 levels across land, air, and sea. A Hangar is available to upgrade the ship and customize it with weapons, propulsion systems, and armor. The Hangar must be defended though, in which case the Wii Remote acts as an anti-aircraft turret to attack at all angles. For team play, a two-player cooperative mode is included, letting gamers fuse debris and finish missions together.<br />

Blast Works is due for a fall release.
