Covering a Japanese-language interview with Nikkei Shimbun with Hideki Okamura, Wired's Chris Kohler notes that the Sega managing director is saying the company is <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/02/sega_switches_f.html">shifting its focus away</a> from the Sony's flagging PlayStation Portable and refocusing efforts on the Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
Part of the challenge for developing for DS is, of course, that Nintendo themselves become your primary competition&mdash;a sentiment <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2293">echoed by Namco Bandai</a>, now echoed by Okamura.<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Hideki Okamura</span>We have to do a lot of thinking about titles for Nintendo's hardware, because Nintendo's own titles are extremely strong. It really is difficult to sell a title as a third party. What that means is that we've got to go after it with force: "heave-ho!"</div></div><br />
Okamura says Sega has a DS title they have planned for release this year that will "surprise absolutely everyone".
