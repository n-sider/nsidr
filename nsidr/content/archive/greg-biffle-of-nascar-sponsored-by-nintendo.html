This time, they are sponsoring NASCAR driver Greg Biffle with a Wii-inspired car. <br />
<br />
The car will make its debut August 12 at the Watkins Glen International. Nintendo and NASCAR fans can already purchase a die-cast <a href="http://www.thesundayhauler.com/store/greg_biffle_wii2007.html">replica</a>, which is expected to ship in October.
