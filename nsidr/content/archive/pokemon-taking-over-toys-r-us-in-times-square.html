The latest place to catch Pokémon will be at the Toys "R" Us in Times Square. From June 6 to July 5, a special boutique will open in the store, providing fans a chance to nab "an extensive collection" of licensed Pokémon merchandise, including several exclusives. <br />
<br />
The goods range from action figures, plushes, backpacks, T-shirts, cards, and more. Exclusive <i>Pokémon: Diamond</i> and <i>Pearl</i> action figures (including Manaphy, Buizel, and Pikachu) will make an appearance, with Jakks Pacific crafting these toys as well as season 10 ones to accompany the latest episodes of the television show which began airing this week. Pokémon Trading Card Game enthusiasts will find that they can get 3-Pack booster sets for Diamond and Pearl a week before any other store. Finally, the boutique will be airing the newest movie, <i>Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea</i>, on a big screen monitor.<br />
<br />
The store is located at the corner of Broadway and 44th Street. The boutique can be found on the second floor.
