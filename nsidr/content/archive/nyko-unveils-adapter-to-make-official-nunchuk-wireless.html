Peripheral manufacturer Nyko has announced their latest accessory, intended to free the two-handed Wii player from the shackles of the armspan-length white cord that runs between the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk.<br />

The Cord-Free wireless adapter, pictured, comes with a wireless dongle that attaches to and matches the profile of the Wii Remote, as well as a self-standing cord-wrap base for the Nunchuk itself, which Nyko reckons will run for 60 hours on two AAAs at up to 15 feet.  It's expected to be at retail in February.<br />

The Cord-Free follows up on Nyko's own <a href="http://www.nyko.com/nyko/products/?i=133">Wireless Nunchuk</a>, for those who aren't attached to their official product.
