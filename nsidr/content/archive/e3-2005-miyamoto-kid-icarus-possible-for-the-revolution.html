<p>In a recent interview with IGN, legendary game designer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> all but confirmed that a successor to NES classic, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=212">Kid Icarus</a> could very well appear on the Revolution.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>IGNcube:</b> Will you make Kid Icarus for Revolution?</p>

<p><b>Shigeru Miyamoto:</b> Well, I'm actually working really closely right now with the director of the [original] game. Now, whether or not when we get the Revolution all set up and everything is finalized, well who knows? That might be one of those characters where everybody says, "Hey, with the way our console is designed, that would be a perfect match." My question to you is, if we made this game would you buy it?</p>

<p><b>IGNcube:</b> Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>Shigeru Miyamoto:</b> Well, we obviously can't ignore that. Okay, we'll get the Eggplant Wizard coming back.</p></blockquote>

Mr. Miyamoto also commented on the Revolution's power, Mario 128 and much more. The full interview can be read over at <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/617/617000p1.html">IGN GameCube</a>.
