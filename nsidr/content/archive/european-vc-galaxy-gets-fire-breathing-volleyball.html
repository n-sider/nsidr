Our apologies for being a little late this time around, but last Friday the European Virtual Console service of the Wii Shop Channel nabbed a few new titles to add to its catalog. They are as follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Breath of Fire II</i> (SNES; 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Galaga '90</i> (Turbografx; 600 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Volleyball</i> (NES; 500 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
All three titles are live and can be downloaded to European Wii consoles once an appropriate sacrifice in the form of Wii Points is made.  Out of Wii Points?  Use your credit card or buy a Wii Points Card.
