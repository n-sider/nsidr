You may have played <i>Tetris Attack</i>, <i>Pokemon Puzzle League</i>, or if you're particularly erudite, <i>Panel de Pon</i>&mdash;but this year, Nintendo's releasing it on the DS as <i>Planet Puzzle League</i>.<br />
<br />
Planet Puzzle League is played by moving blocks left or right with the stylus and trying to match three or more in a row or column.  Strategy comes in by setting up your matches to make chains.  In multiplayer modes, heavy chaining will bury your opponent in garbage.<br />
<br />
Full support for the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with online play for up to four players is present, and folks on each others' Friend Rosters can engage in friendly epithet-hurtling during matches.  For non-friend matches, a Wi-Fi Novice mode is also available for newcomers until they've accumulated a certain number of wins, giving them a chance to learn the game.<br />
<br />
Planet Puzzle League is already out in Japan as <i>Panel de Pon DS</i>.  It hits North American retail on June 4.
