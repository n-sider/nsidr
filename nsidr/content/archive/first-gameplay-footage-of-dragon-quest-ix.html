The game promises four-player co-operative play and Nintendo Wi-Fi service functionality.  Said a Square-Enix spokesperson: "By taking full advantage of Nintendo DS' wireless communication capability, we have fulfilled the thrill of [the] "network experience" -- embarking on adventures with real 'friends' instead of on your own."<br />
<br />
The game hits Japan in mid-2007.
