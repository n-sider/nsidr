It is now the time of year to vote in AskMen.com's <a href="http://www.askmen.com/specials/2007_top_49/">Top 49 Men of 2007</a>. It's as simple as rating the nominees from 1 to 10, and at the end, the man with the highest average ratings is the big number one.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.askmen.com/specials/2006_top_49/index.html">Last year's</a> top man of 2006 was George Clooney, but this year, one of the nominees is a man gamers everywhere recognize as the creator of some of Nintendo's most popular franchises: Shigeru Miyamoto. Surely, all others pale in comparison.<br />
<br />
To put in your vote for the father of Mario, find your way to the Arts & Culture tab and scroll down a bit. Don't hesitate to put in your vote for any of the other nominees you may find worthy.
