<p>It was announced during Nintendo's press conference that the Wii remote will contain both a speaker as well as a rumble feature.  Developers are said to already have a lot of ideas of how to put these abilities to use.  Below are some of the big Nintendo games announced during the show.  Over 27 Wii games are expected to be playable on the E3 Expo show floor tomorrow.  Even more will be shown in video form.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Wii</b></font></p>
<p><ul>
<li><b>WiiSports</b> - Tennis, Golf, and Baseball all in one package. Available on launch.<br><br>

<li><b>Super Mario Galaxy</b> - Mario jumps, slides and flies around various planets. Nintendo says players can "grab onto shooting stars with the pointer and skip along the stratosphere."<br><br>

<li><b>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</b> - The "most intuitive first-person shooter ever," says Nintendo.<br><br>

<li><b>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</b> - Two editions will be released in North America; one for GameCube and one for Wii.  Both will arrive at Wii's launch.<br><br>

<li><b>Excite Truck</b> - An homage to Nintendo's Excitebike series, Excite Truck allows players to jump into various off-road vehicles.  Reggie said referencing the Wii controller, "Now you're holding a steering wheel of a big damn truck."<br><br>

<li><b>Project H.A.M.M.E.R</b> - You can swing your controller to beat up swarms of enemies.<br><br>

<li><b>Disaster</b> - Appears to be an epic game where you're placed against the elements of mother nature.  A scene shows a giant tidal wave approaching a coastal city.  "Come feel the panic and bring disaster under your control," said Reggie.<br><br>

<li><b>Fire Emblem</b> - Another game in the Fire Emblem series.  The CG sequences looked incredible, even better than those shown on the GameCube version.  Nothing was mentioned about the game during the conference; only a short clip was shown.
