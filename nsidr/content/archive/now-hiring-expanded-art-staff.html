<h3>Now Hiring: Expanded Art Staff</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> As of 10/6, hiring is officially over.  Those who sent in applications, thanks for your interest.  Those who are just now reading this little story, kindly ignore everything from here on out!</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>N-Sider is currently accepting applications for freehand artists that wish to be a part of one of the most ambitious and endlessly-delayed projects in the history of video game media.  Responsibilities include the creation of stand-alone artistic pieces, as well as design and layout-centric illustration.  All Nintendo-related, of course.</p>

<p>There are two key attributes that we're looking for in prospective applicants:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Talent</b>.  In order to create the best impact possible, we need the best people possible.  If your artistic experience is limited to drawing stick-men in MS Paint, don't expect an especially fond welcoming party.
<li><b>Dedication</b>.  We need people who are willing to set aside a significant amount of time and dedicate themselves to the site.  Now I'm not talking reclusive psycho dedication here, but we need people who care enough to stick around and get some serious work done.
</ol>

<p>Think you've got what it takes?  Send an application to <a href="mailto:hiring@n-sider.com">hiring@n-sider.com</a> with samples of your work and a paragraph or two about yourself.  We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>And who knows, with an accomplished enough art staff we might actually launch the Universe some day!  Haha, I kid, we all know that will never happen.</p>
