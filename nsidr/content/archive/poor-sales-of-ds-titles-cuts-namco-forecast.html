<p>Namco Bandai has not having quite the success story that Nintendo has when it comes to the Nintendo DS.  Poor sales of many of its DS titles (<i>Tamagotchi Connexion: Corner Shop!</i> excepted) have led it to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8272">cut its FY 2005 forecast 55%</a>.</p>

<p>The news is particularly unfortunate, since Namco's <i>Pac-Pix</i> was easily one of the most creative titles on the DS in its first year.  If only Nintendo can successfully bring these kinds of titles to market on Nintendo systems, the question must be asked: how many truly unique and new experiences can we ever expect to see on Nintendo systems in the future, no matter how inventive the hardware gets?</p>
