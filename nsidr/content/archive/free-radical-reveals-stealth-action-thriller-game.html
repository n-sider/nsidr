<p>Free Radical Design recently announced its latest project, a game tentatively titled <i>Second Sight</i>. Set for release in late 2004 on the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, the game is said to "combine an immersive thriller storyline with paranormal psychic abilities, stealthy exploration, and intense shooter action." 

<p>While little is truly known about the game, Free Radical has given a relatively intriguing summary of the game's storyline. The following is a direct excerpt from the press release. 

<blockquote><p><i>John Vattic awakens from a coma in a sinister US medical facility where he has been subjected to traumatic surgery and experimentation. </i>

<p><i>His body and mind are broken, he doesn't know his name, he can't remember his past, all he knows is that his only hope for survival is to escape and unravel the mystery that has led to his imprisonment.</i> 

<p><i>Finding fragments of the past reveals his previous involvement in a covert military mission investigating psychic research in Siberia...</i>

<p><i>... A mission that went horribly wrong. A mission that empowered him with awesome psychic abilities which can devastate the people and world around him.</i> 

<p><i>Haunted by flashbacks, tormented by his powers and gripped by the fear that he may have been somehow to blame for what happened in Siberia, John Vattic begins searching for survivors from the failed expedition and uncovers a fatal chain of events leading to a sinister conspiracy and sickening abuse of power.</i></blockquote> 

<p><b>Steve Ellis, Director of Free Radical, says</b> "<i>Second Sight marks an important step in the expansion of Free Radical. The company has grown to two talented teams, developing two great original products. We've come a long way in 5 years.</i>" 

<p>For those wondering, Free Radical was formed a few years back by a group of ex-Rare employees who defected from the <i>Goldeneye 007</i> team after the game was completed. Free Radical is best known for the TimeSplitters series. <i>TimeSplitters 2</i> was an original game that felt reminiscent of <i>Goldeneye</i> and recieved both popular and critical acclaim upon its release in late 2002.
