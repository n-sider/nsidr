<p><a href="http://news.com.com/Doctor%2C+did+you+warm+up+with+Grand+Theft+Auto/2100-1043_3-6076064.html">Reuters</a> reports that a study conducted by <a href="http://www.rosseramti.com/miniminvassurg/main.html">Dr. James Rosser</a> has found that surgeons who warmed-up for 20 minutes playing video games such as Super Monkey Ball before performing surgical drills were "faster and made fewer errors than those who did not."  The study involved 303 surgeons.  Those who played a video game before performing a laparoscopic surgical procedure completed an average of 11 seconds faster than those who didn't.</p>

<p>In perhaps related news, Atlus will release its sequel to Trauma Center for the Nintendo Wii launch later this year.  Titled <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2086">Trauma Center: Second Opinion</a>, the game places players in the role of a doctor, pushed into stressful medical situations where you must perform surgery and save the lives of your patients.</p>
