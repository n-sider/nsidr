Nintendo has released its first-quarter financial results. Things are looking good, as is the trend lately for the Japanese behemoth. While the DS continues to sell well, Wii is flying off shelves and will soon overtake Xbox 360 as the console with the highest sales.<br />
<br />
As of the end of June, total sales for Wii had reached 9.27 million units worldwide, and the DS attained hardware sales of 47.27 million. Because the hardware is still selling so well, Nintendo has announced an increase in forecasted sales for the current fiscal year. Wii has risen from 14 million to 16.5 million units shipped, and DS from 22 to 26 million. Software shipments will also see an increase for both platforms.<br />
<br />
Aside from hardware sales, this year's April-June sales and profits have all increased greatly, when compared to the April-June period of last year.<br />
<br />
There seems to be no end in sight to Nintendo's domination of the sales charts. Unfortunately, there also seems to be no end in sight to the Wii shortages each and every month. Here's to hoping there aren't too many unhappy children this coming holiday season.
