<p>Buena Vista Games announced today that it is bringing an entirely new property (definitely a change of pace for the publisher) to the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>The game is <cite>Spectrobes</cite>, and it is "an anime-inspired action/role-playing game" being developed by Jupiter Corporation.  It follows the adventures of two "Interplanetary Patrol officers" excavating fossilized prehistoric creatures called Spectrobes and training them for battle against the Krawl, who are threatening to destroy the galaxy.</p>

<p>The title will use the DS's touch screen to excavate the creatures.  Once excavated, players will collect, train, evolve, and customize their Spectrobes.</p>

<p>Buena Vista has not yet announced a release date for <cite>Spectrobes</cite>, nor whether the title will be playable at the upcoming E3 show next week.</p>
