<p>The very first Nintendo DS option pack, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=977">Daigasso! Band Brothers</a> Request Selection, was shipped directly this week to Japanese customers who ordered the expansion from Nintendo's website.</p>

<p>The option pack takes the form of a Game Boy Advance cartridge which is inserted into the Nintendo DS's slot 2 at the same time the original DS game is in slot 1.  When the game is started, the option pack makes 31 new songs available within the game.</p>
