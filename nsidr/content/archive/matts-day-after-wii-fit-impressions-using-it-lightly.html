Dean's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=3179">grand experiment</a> is definitely our big <i>Wii Fit</i> bit here at N-Sider, but that doesn't mean others of us aren't getting into it as well.  Personally, I almost didn't, at least not right now.<br />
<br />
It wasn't due to any distaste for Wii Fit itself; in fact, I'd had some opportunity to enjoy it at E3 last and rather liked it.  What I was concerned about was the fact that I already had a working exercise routine as well as a recent heel injury I had to be cautious of; I'm sure it would have been aggravated by some of Wii Fit's step-centric exercises.  After talking to both a friend and Dean yesterday, though, I decided to grab it anyway, if only for the yoga and the balance games.<br />
<br />
I'm pleased to report that you can use Wii Fit rather nicely alongside your existing workouts.  Not only was I not pushed into any particular workout, leaving me free to pick and choose whatever it is I feel like I want to deal with that day, but I found that it's actually rather easy to record the exercise I already do and even bank Fit minutes for it&#8212;turning the thing into a rather handy way to track even largely out-of-Fit wellness.  And you can do it all within the <i>Wii Fit Channel</i>, negating the need to jam the disc in unless you actually want to do the exercises.<br />
<br />
The graphing has one key weakness, though, or at least it seems to here at the outset: it doesn't do any kind of smoothing.  I got chewed out by the Balance Board this morning because it was under the impression I'd lost 4 pounds and blown by my loss goal I'd set the evening prior; in reality, I'd started using it the day before soon after dinner and before sleeping.  I think I may start plugging the Fit weight figures into my trusty <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/palm/">Eat Watch</a>, which will very nicely smooth out those fluctuating numbers and give me a much more realistic idea of my weight and progress.  (Interestingly, it looks like there's <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/online/hdo.html">a new online version</a> in case you don't own a Palm or Treo.)<br />
<br />
One could successfully argue using Wii Fit like I plan to isn't worth $90; I might even agree with you.  But if the price doesn't put you off, and you were hesitating for reasons similar to mine, it might still be worth a look.
