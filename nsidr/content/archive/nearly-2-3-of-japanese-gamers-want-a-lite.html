<p>Gamasutra has <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8131">results of a survey</a> by +D Games of Japanese gamers, querying them as to their intentions towards Nintendo's DS redesign, the DS Lite.</p>

<p>The survey found 63% of respondents indicating they will purchase a DS Lite when it releases in Japan this March.  27% of the total sample want to upgrade to the Lite from their current DS, and 36% don't yet own a DS but will be jumping on the Lite bandwagon.  Just over a third &mdash; 35% &mdash; informed +D they didn't have any intentions to own a DS, Lite or no.</p>

<p>Of course, there's still no word on a US release forthcoming from NOA.</p>
