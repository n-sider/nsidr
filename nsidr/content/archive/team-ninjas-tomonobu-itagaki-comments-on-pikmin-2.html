<p>Tomonobu Itagaki, game designer with a large ego from Tecmo's Team Ninja, was interviewed in the September 2004 issue of Play magazine.  During the interview he commented on the enjoyment he has received from the Pikmin series and his interest, if given the opportunity, in being involved with a sequel.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p><b>Play:</b> Are there any games or developers you particularly admire?</p>

<p><b>Itagaki:</b> Of course, there are other games I like to play, but I would not say I could not do a better job. Because I know I could do a better job of making any game that is out there. Personally, I like Pikmin 2. Again, if I were asked to do Pikmin 3, I could do a better job than Nintendo. But then if I do that, I can't just play for my personal enjoyment anymore. I want to have enough games outside of my own that I can enjoy playing without any distractions.</p>
