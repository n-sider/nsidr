IGN.com has posted an article that reiterates Nintendo's stance during the next-generation -- that it doesn't intend to directly compete with the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360.  Several developers have come forward with their thoughts on the technical specifications for Nintendo's Project Revolution console.  Check out the story <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/673/673799p1.html">here</a>.

This news comes as a contradiction to earlier comments from Nintendo where they indicated that graphical power is merely the admission for entry into the next-generation.  More recent comments however noted that the Nintendo Revolution would instead be created with mass production, low price, and other factors (including the innovation of the Revolution controller) in mind.  It's clear now this is the route Nintendo will take.  After all, according to Nintendo, graphics aren't the only way one can advance video games.  Game interaction and accessibility can also be improved.<br><br>
Will this strategy be successful?  We'll find out that answer in several years time.
