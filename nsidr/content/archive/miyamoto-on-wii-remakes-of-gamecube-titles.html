<p>NeoGAF's Jonnyram has <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=115439">translated</a> a Nintendo Dream interview with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, where he talks about the possibilities of retrofitting old titles with Wii functionality.</p>

<p>"I can remake some of my GameCube games for Wii, making use of the Wiimote," Miyamoto explained.  Development costs will be much lower, he argues, since the Wii uses the same development architecture as the GameCube.  "Since a lot of the development cost has already been accounted for, we'll be able to release these at a much more affordable price," he noted hoping that third party developers will take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Zelda is perhaps the first of many previously GameCube titles being remade for Wii.  "I strongly believe there is [a possibility Nintendo will release Wii remakes of games]," Miyamoto said.  "For this reason, the next Zelda will be released for both Wii and GC simultaneously. It's quite an interesting experiment."</p>

<p>Miyamoto also touched on a few potential remakes of never-released titles including <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=547">Mario 128</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/uncovering-marionette">Marionette</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/the-tokaido-shinkansen-express">Stage Debut</a>.  Miyamoto reiterated that Mario 128 was only a test concept, but that elements of the demo have made it into Super Mario Galaxy including the pull of gravity while running around a sphere.  Marionette, originally in production for GameCube, is said to now be in development for Wii. Finally, some elements of Stage Debut were seen in E3 demos such as Wii Sports where players could map their face to an in-game character.  Some of the other elements from Stage Debut might make it into other games as well.</p>
