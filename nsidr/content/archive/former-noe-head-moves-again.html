<p>According to GameSpot, former Nintendo Europe and Capcom Europe president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1445">Shigeru Ota</a> has acquired a position at mobile games publisher Digital Bridges.  Current NoE president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1387">Satoru Shibata</a> became Ota's replacement in August 2000.</p>

<p>What makes this somewhat interesing, whether it's coincidence or not, is that former Nintendo Europe executive of sales and marketing, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1385">David Gosen</a> also left to join Digital Bridges in June of this year.</p>
