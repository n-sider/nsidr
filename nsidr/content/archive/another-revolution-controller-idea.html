<p>The following is a Revolution controller design idea created by N-Sider reader D. Whitlock. Again to make this perfectly clear, <i>it is just a fun idea for what the artist would like and how he envisions the Revolution controller looking and functioning.</i> If you would like to submit your own ideas with pictures, please send them <a href="mailto:glen@n-sider.com">this way</a>. If enough are received, we'll send the most impressive submission a Nintendo DS Mario Kart stylus.</p>

<p>The a,x, and y buttons can be used as traditional face buttons. They 
can also be rotated 360 in either direction around the trackball and left in any position desired.  When pressed, the buttons are able to rotate on their own axis; this allows the players' thumbs to hold the button in the same direction as the button circles the trackball.  The button does not move beneath the player's thumb causing more friction, but instead floats spinning on top of the "wheel."</p>

<p>The analog stick's thumb pad also features the same ability as the 
buttons -- allowing the pad to spin on top of the shaft of the stick.</p>

<p>I included some switches in case people wanted things like start/select, console power switch, controller power switch, controller channels, rumble on/off, gyro on/off, a button wheel lock, etc.  You decide what you would like to imagine they are for.</p>

<p>I did not picture the shoulder functions because I am torn between two mechanics.  One setup would involve a traditional trigger with a 
digital clicking, a scroll wheel above the trigger, and a middle finger digital button beneath the trigger.  The other setup would involve a round trigger similar to the Cube's with a groove for the finger, a digital click, and the ability to spin the trigger like a scroll wheel.  The second setup would mean a trigger wheel with a digital middle finger button beneath.  The advantage of having a trigger wheel is that the player can select his or her weapon without taking the finger off of the the trigger.  It is really a decision of whether you like fewer buttons or more buttons.</p>
