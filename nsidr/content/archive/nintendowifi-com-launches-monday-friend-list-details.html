<p>In Nintendo's official forums, NOA employee NOA_RUFUS <a href="http://forums.nintendo.com/nintendo/board/message?board.id=ds&message.id=1995205">said today</a> that Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection information hub <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/">NintendoWifi.com</a> will launch on Monday, November 7.</p>

<p>The site will contain information about DS Wi-Fi functionality, compatible hotspot locations (presumably those run by Wayport in McDonald's restaurants), Q&A about Wi-Fi compatible games, and, according to the latest issue of Nintendo Power, a list of Wi-Fi equipment compatible with the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>Separately, Nintendo of America also reiterated some details of the Wi-Fi Connection to the press today.  They said home users will be able to use existing Wi-Fi equipment or purchase the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector to share their PC's Internet connection with their Nintendo DS, and outside home, Nintendo DS owners would be able to use hotspots at McDonald's restaurants with zero setup, or other hotspots via a laptop running Windows XP and equipped with the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector.</p>

<p>Nintendo has not yet released official details on how the Friend Code functionality works, but some mention has been given <a href="http://gba.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/mario-kart-ds/663801p3.html">in a Mario Kart DS preview</a> by Gamespy.  It appears that a single 12-digit Friend Code is generated when you register your Wi-Fi Connection game online, and you can give this Friend Code to others so they may add you to their friend list for online play.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://dsdev.bigredpimp.com/archives/31">another set of pictures</a> of the Wi-Fi Connection interface has emerged on the BigRedPimp no DSDev blog, courtesy the author's "friend of a friend".  Some never-before-seen screens are shown, including Mario Kart interface shots and the Friend Code entry screen.</p>
