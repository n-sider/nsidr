<p><b style="font-size: 20px">N-Sider Goes Wild: Day 7</b></p>

<b>Another Beginning</b> Matt @ 3:42pm

<p>Word has come down that soon Karen will be able to move on out and into her own place, possibly tomorrow. Ed should be doing the same. Part of me is sad that I'll be the only human left in Niwa, but the other part of me is dancing a merry jig over the prospect of finally having the house to myself, <em>especially</em> on Flea Market days. Tomorrow's quite a big day; all over the world, tons of people are getting the opportunity to move into their new homes. It'll be quite the sight.</p>

<p>So what's been going on today, otherwise? Nook's closed up for remodelling all day, of course, which has put a damper on most of the activities I'd otherwise be able to participate in. I got my hands on a larger house, but apparently Nook's handymen have lost their touch when building floors; safety limits prevent me from putting as much furniture down as I'd like to. Still, the pad looks pretty slick, and I'm looking forward to hopefully convincing Nook to add on new rooms in the future. We shall see.</p>

<p>I did manage to pick up a crimson bandana today that offsets my blindingly bright blue hair, which is rather nice. Provided my entire head isn't blinding the world, I'm pretty happy on the whole.</p>

<b>Moving Again</b> Karen @ 5:13pm

<p>The honeymoon is over. I didn't know that Matt was such a big ladies-man. The fact that he displays a picture of Peanut in our house and kisses it every time he walks by is just too much. He's been saying "Agent S" in his sleep lately and I just can't take it anymore! *sniff* Now you know the real reason why I sold his bird at the flea market.</p>

<p>Nook told me about a brand new town called, Sole. I'll be starting over, but Goose promised me that he'll be my body guard so that I don't get robbed this time. Rolf said he would get revenge on Matt by coughing on Peanut, which will be quite effective. I don't know what disease Rolf has, but it is highly contagious.</p>

<p>I'll miss the animals in Niwa and I'll especially miss waking up and seeing what new freaky hairdo Matt has each day. Once settled, maybe I'll be invited to those famous parties those guys have in their towns.</p>

<b>Business As Usual</b> Conor @ 7:55pm

<p>Nook's reopened today. That guy must have a lot of money to throw around, being able to renovate like that. I guess it's no suprise: if the price of my house is anything to go by, he should be rolling in the Bells. I hope he goes deaf. Good thing he did renovate though: Nook 'n' Go had some flowers I'd been wanting for my garden. So good on you Nook, you have a great range of products and a face we all love to hate.</p>

<p>I tried my luck at getting a design done for the Able Sisters, but it didn't work out. I'm no <i>artiste</i>, but I think I can draw a pretty mean Pac-Ghost. Nobody agreed. I felt sad. But not sad enough to recognise the weather. It was snowing today! Everywhere all you could see was white. Except for one small patch, but I can excuse that. Snow makes some people a little too excited it would seem.</p>

<p>Resetti also came back again today, this time he forced an apology out of me. The way he talks about buttons and things, you'd think he's some sort of character in a game. But of course, that's impossible.</p>

<b>Another Day, Another Expansion</b> Dean @ 8:27pm

<p>Man... so I took a trip to Krypton to sell some peaches, and the car kept breaking down on the trip; had to restart my engine a few times (there was a lot of traffic today, all those new towns popping up all over the freeway)... Anyways, when I got back, Nook's shop was five minutes from closing, so I sold off my Apples that I stole from Krypton and paid off the rest of my debt &mdash; Nook said my house will be ready tomorrow, so I can't wait to see how much bigger it is.</p>

<p>He said he'd be going under another renovation, I hope this is the last one, I honestly can't stand having his store closed every other day; oh well.</p>

<p>Last night I was in Xanadu and I conned Agent S out of most of her worldy posessions, I feel a bit bad, but I think she's got a small crush on me... so I used that to my advantage.</p>

<p>Well, that's it for now, see you tomorrow.</p>

<b>Wait, Don't Leave Yet!</b> Matt @ 9:04pm

<p>It's been a blast sharing the adventures we've been having in our towns with everyone this past week. We hope you've enjoyed reading about them as much as we've enjoyed writing about them.</p>

<p>Of course, any of you are moving into your own towns tomorrow, and as such, you may be tempted to stop dropping by. Still, please keep sticking your head in from time to time to see what we're up to! Several of our friends are also moving in tomorrow or in the real near future and will be writing about their own adventures right here.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining us, and thanks in advance for sticking with us!</p>
