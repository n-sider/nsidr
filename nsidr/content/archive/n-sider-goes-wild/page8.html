<b>Remodelling AGAIN?</b> Matt @ 1:31pm

<p>I can't believe it. Nook is going through yet <em>another</em> store in one day. I swear, the guy is some sort of massive commerce hub or something. I spend some time this morning bringing in a couple loads of fish for him to buy, Karen buys a couple minor things, and wham bam, he's suddenly announcing that it's time to remodel again! At least I'm pretty confident this'll be his last expansion; I don't expect the Niwa township board will let this unfettered capitalism continue, being power-drunk local government and all that.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I dropped by Hyrule and N-Sider last night, mostly to make up for my total lack of a marketplace in which to sell my pockets-full-o'-fish for those always-needed Bells. I tried to visit Dean's party (mostly to make him feel good, I mean, he was so excited about it, I didn't want to make him feel bad by not coming) but couldn't even fit in the door. At least Bret and he seemed to be having a lot of fun in there, bumping and grinding and all, I suppose. Hoo-rah!</p>

<p>I'm on good terms with Karen again, too. After feeling so badly about selling off my poor pet bird to a deal-hungry animal (probably as a light snack), she went and paid off our current construction loan. I expect Nook will take this as impetus to expand our little home yet another time. Can't wait to see the bill for this one...</p>

<b>Bad Hair Day</b> Matt @ 4:01pm

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld_bad-hair-day.jpg" style="float: right;">This, ladies and gentlemen, is what happens when you trust a pink poodle with your hair.</p>

<p>The preceding message was brought to you by Residents for Sane Hairstyles and the International Council of Tasteful Cranial Decoration.</p>

<b>Mad About The Squirrel</b> Matt @ 5:57pm

<p>So, a startling revelation has come down courtesy Peanut, the little pink squirrel.</p>

<p>I guess I should have seen it coming when she flagged me down and handed me a little photograph of herself to put up in my place. I thought at the time, hey, what a great friend!</p>

<p>Then, as I was taking a load of fish to Nook, she flagged me down again.</p>

<p>"Hey, we're Niwa's sweethearts, aren't we?"</p>

<p>Immediately after she said it, she got all flustered. Man, I dunno what it is. First Agent S (who Ferquin has just discovered is a girl) falls in love with me, now Peanut, just a hop/skip/jump away... I don't know what to think.</p>

<b>What Was That Again?</b> Bret @ 6:42pm

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld-chillin.jpg" style="float: right;">So Matt and I both got haircuts today, and they both turned out rather... bad. That poodle won't be getting my business again (until I decide to fix my hair). Right now I'm doing a good coverup job with my wizard hat and HMD. Nook must like the traffic she brings in, however, since he just remodeled his store into a Nookington's.</p>

<p>Speaking of Nookington's, have you seen the furniture selection in that place? It's got some real nice stuff, but some of it can be expensive, especially on a meager budget like mine. Hopefully, when I get my orchard finalized, I'll be able to afford some of the more... luxurious furniture.</p>

<p style="clear: right;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld-lounging.jpg" style="float: right;">I also visited Ferquin again today, and someone has been a baaaad boy. I know that there is no way in Hyrule that those animals knew those phrases before he moved in! After talking to a few of his animals, we decided to sit down and catch a soccer game. Wouldn't you know it, but our team lost! Ya always hate to see the home team go down in flames.</p>

<b>Bootleg</b> Travis @ 6:55pm
<p>Yesterday, and today for that matter, have been rather quiet. Nice peaceful days are what I call them. I did a lot of fishing and paid off my house again. It's been expanded two sized already and I'm grateful for the room. A basement would be nice, however.</p>

<p>Last night I went to the coffee shop and was happy to see K.K. Slider had come into town. I missed out on Dean's Dance Party so I thought I'd give him a listen. He played a song called K.K. Ska for me and I rather like it. He even gave me a bootleg copy of it for free! He told me that producers were always trying to get him to charge money for his music, but that his music yearned to be free. I can't say I'd do the same in his position, but I'm happy with the free music. I look forward to seeing him next Saturday.</p>

<p>This morning I bought a red turnip seed. I hope to grow it well and sell it off to Nook within the week. I even bought a watering can for the occasion. I'm not much of a gardener, but I'll do anything for a profit.</p>

<p>I have to say I am jealous of Matt's love prowess. None of the animals in my town have gone gaga over me except maybe Punchy, but he's a boy! As far as I know he's still after Dora as well. Speaking of which, Dora has begun talking like Punchy. I almost thought they were now together, but she started talking to me about how she thought Punchy should go make the first move with Yuka. I can't say that I agree, Yuka is terrifying. I wonder, though, is Dora leading Punchy on?</p>
