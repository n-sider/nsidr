<b>So... Groggy...</b> Matt @ 4:32am

<p>Anyone else remember what happened last night?</p>

<p>I seem to remember taking several trips through my town's gate... transporting fruit all over the place without declaration... convincing some guy named "Punchy" that the other two non-human residents were going at it on the sly... just little bits and pieces, really.</p>

<p>What do I have to show for it? A viking hat. Yeah, a viking hat. And a curious futuristic-looking metal floor on the lower level of my home. Needless to say, I'm quite confused at this point.</p>

<p>A quick look over at Karen's bed suggests she might have been in on it too; she's ditched the triple-ponytail look for some bizarre Geisha getup. I'm really not sure what to think at this point.</p>

<p>Maybe some of you other guys can help clear up just what the hell it is I did last night, and why there's a dozen little tree sprouts scattered all over the place?</p>

<b>Re: Phenomenons</b> Dean @ 8:12am

<p>I too, like Matt experienced insane teleportation and seemed to move forward and backward through time and space. I'm a little more coherent, however, as I think Matt was on the happy-juice if you know what I mean. It all started when Matt came to visit me at N-Sider, I walked in on him and Nook comparing sizes... of their rugs, you know. And I experienced something quite frightening.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the walls changed colors, then they went back, then the floor turned all metallic, things were shifting all throughout the room, and I had nothing to do with it! It's almost as if Matt obtained special powers and was able to change the room at his will. Nevertheless, everything went back to normal shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Travis came to visit us too, and this is where things got really weird; Matt went off to make an impression on my local townsfolk, while Travis and I went fishing. After a while, we decided to head to Travis' home, Krypton. Yeah yeah, there's probably some legal issues with a town being called Krypton, I mean hey, even his flag is the Superguy logo!</p>

<p>I had brought tons of peaches along too, sold them for close to 5000 bells; they're just fruit, but I made a killing. I also stole some apples to plant in my town too, and I would have, if someone didn't buy the only shovel at Nook's store!</p>

<p>On the bright side, however, I paid off my first debt to Nook, and I haven't checked yet, but he promised me some bigger digs... so yeah, I'm gonna go look at that now.</p>

<p>TTYL!</p>

<b>Perhaps I Should Have Flown In</b> Bret @ 8:14am

<p>I must have prepared for this trip for hours. I knew it would be long, but I had no idea how long it would seem to me. My driver was a kooky old man by the name of Kappn. I could have sworn I knew him from somewhere, but perhaps I am mistaken. Kappn and I chatted it up a bit, but my mind was mostly on the new town; what I would do and where I would live.</p>

<p>After what seemed like days, Kappn and I pulled into Hyrule at 11:30 PM on the dot. I can't say that I was too sleepy, because I was buzzing with anticipation. Moving to a new town can be tough, but it makes it much easier if wonderful people live there. After removing my bags from the car I made my way to town hall, where I received a map of the town! Just the thing I needed to get oriented, since I am map crazy. Following the map, I found the house that kindly Tom Nook built for me. It was indeed "cozy" as he said it was, and maybe a bit too cozy. Perhaps one day I can make a bigger house, but I must attend to my current needs first.</p>

<p>When I finally got everything in my bags put away, I decided to explore the town a bit. Yeah, it was late, but theres nothing ever wrong with an evening stroll! By this time I was dead tired, and I must have looked like a ghost, for I scared poor Melba right out of her stockings. I apologized and introduced myself, and we talked for a while. I am so glad the people in this town are friendly. I still needed to find employment, but I didnt figure I would find anything that night.</p>

<p>Isnt it funny, though, how your needs sometimes find themselves filled? After following the map to Tom Nooks store, Nooks Cranny, he immediately offered me a part-time job to help ease my transition! Even though it turned out to be just a temporary job, it was still something for me to do, and I am happy for it.</p>

<p>Now I must turn my attention again towards making a bit of cash to pay off my meager mortgage. I hope I can find my way here, because I am believe I am growing attached to this town already.</p>

<b>Look, Up In The Sky!</b> Dean @ 9:46am

<p>I just returned from Hyrule while visiting Bret (I stole some of his pears!), and Tom Nook told me that my house was bigger and that I owed him 120,000 bells! Man that guy asks for a lot. I was running around and saw a present flying around attached to a balloon.. if only I had some sort of sling shot to take it down with, who knows what was in that package, and I suppose we'll never find out. Sigh.</P>

<p>I've decked myself out with a Hockey Mask, Toque, and optional Gas Mask - I look pretty scary, all we need now is an Axe and I can go terrorize the other towns, bwha ha ha hahaha...</p>

<b>The Morning After</b> Travis @ 10:24am

<p>I think someone put something in the coffee I had last night. I went to Dean's town of N-Sider for a visit with him and Matt, but all of a sudden it was as if it had never happened. Either I dreamed it or some strange force made me being in the town no longer possible and I was sent back home. I don't know what happened to me and I feared for my life and when I went to Matt's town of Niwa the same thing happened. I wondered if Gaston's obsession with fossils has brought up an evil into this world that is cheating my mind with some spell.</p>

<p>However, when I visited later nothing happened and the trips went smoothly. I even had them over to my town and we had an absolute blast. I got behind in my attempt to pay off my debt to Tom Nook as a result, unfortunately, but I only have 4,000 more bells that I owe him.</p>

<p>This morning I took a stroll around town to greet my neighbors. Gaston got upset with me because he asked me if I thought he was like a Red Pepper or a Bell Pepper (honestly, what kind of a question is that?) and I told him he was closer to a Bell Pepper. Well he freaked out and started steaming at the ears. He suggested that I thought I was better than everyone else. Well, I'm certainly better than you, Gaston.</p>

<p>Punchy got upset too, while I was in his home. He freaked out about the upcoming flea market on Saturday. Said he gets way too nervous about these things and I can certainly vouch for that. I had to leave as soon as he started talking about it because he began sweating profusely over the ordeal.</p>

<p>Dora was pleasant, however, but did not have anything too interesting to say. Both her and Gaston say "squeaky" at the end of almost every sentence so I think they're an item of sorts. I told Punchy later that they was lots of smooching between them and he was grossed out.</p>

<p>The biggest news today, so far, is that my town now has a new resident. Her name is Yuka, she's a purple koala. She had all sorts of boxes in her house from the recent move and asked me to come back tomorrow to meet her properly. She was too busy today. I look forward to tomorrow and may even wear my tuxedo.</p>

<p>Today I think I'll go visit Dean or Matt again. Maybe I can convince them to play some hide 'n seek. I am rather fond of that game. Tom Nook's Cranny is closed for remodeling today so I can't sell any goods to him to remove the debt or even buy a shovel. Of course, it's just hope that I assume a shovel would have been in stock today. I need one to plant the peach Dean gave me so that I can have lovely peach trees in my town. Apples are nice, but I want some variety.</p>

<b>Scandal</b> Travis @ 2:18pm

<p>Today has turned out more interesting than I would have expected. When Tom Nook informed me he was closing the shop for the day I didn't think I'd find anything to do. This is a small town and I'm still new here so I don't know all the fun things to do just yet. But my neighbors have successfully been more interesting than I would have thought. It's a bona fide soap opera here.</p>

<p>One may recall that I had a chat with Punchy about whether or not Dora and Gaston were friends or more than friends (if you catch my drift) earlier. Well I had this exact same conversation twice more. He won't shut up about it. Then just now I went over to see Dora and she told me that Punchy and Gaston were fighting. Is it just me or is Punchy jealous of the possible love between Gaston and Dora?</p>

<b>Strangers</b> Karen @ 5:24pm

<p>I could have sworn that it was just Matt and I living in the house. When I went to sleep last night, we had two beds; now we have three beds. There's some guy named Ed sleeping in our house. He looked so sweet and innocent sleeping there, so I decided not to kick him out.</p>

<p>Alli moved into town today. We really hit it off. Really, all the animals seem get along with me; I received lots of gifts from them tonight. We decided to throw a housewarming party for Alli at her house tomorrow night. I'm really looking forward to it for more ways than one; it seems that Goose and Alli are having a fling. Peanut and Bones were quite ready to gossip about it. I caught Peanut arguing with Goose earlier; Goose got really steamed, it took quite a while to calm him. Later on, Peanut sent him a present to smooth things over... I wonder what that's about; an animal love triangle perhaps? I guess Goose's new exercise program is paying off.</p>

<p>I mapped some constellations today, one of my constellations looks kind of like a dragon. I also found a K in the sky and named it Karen Was Here. Maybe other towns will find my K in the sky. Watch your skies, maybe you'll find it!</p>

<p>I decided that Matt can be my sugar-daddy and pay off the mortgage to the house. A girl needs accessories, don't you know? I spent the few hours of awake time I had by making patterns, picking up seashells, and fishing. I'm getting better at the fishing and even caught an Octopus. I donated a few of the fish I caught to the museum. I saw a number of insects while walking today, too... I wish I had a net!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I can't forget to mention the funny thing that happened to me today: I was talking to Bones, and he happened to mention that Matt sent him a "Love Letter". I'll leave you with that.</p>
