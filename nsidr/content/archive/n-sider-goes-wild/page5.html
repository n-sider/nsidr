<b>Yeah, Right... Ed</b> Matt @ 5:07am

<p>Sorry, did I forget to mention Ed? He's drifting through on his way to his own town, which he plans to arrive at sometime in the near future. Old buddy of mine, needed a place to crash. I hope you don't mind too much, Karen. It's only for a few days... or weeks... umm. Something to that effect, at least. And as for Bones, if I'd known he was going to get all aflutter over a dumb little "nice to meet you" letter, I'd have never sent it in the first place.</p>

<p>Almost makes me wistful for the days when I'd get a mailbox stuffed full of "what the heck were you trying to say?" letters every morning from my neighbors.</p>

<p>Between Karen and I, we've apparently driven Nook's profits way up, because he's closed for remodelling today. In addition, yesterday, I paid off my loan, and despite my protests, he expanded my home overnight. I suspect I'll be getting another bill in the mail, now; where's a lawyer when you need one, anyway? Bret said he had a visit from an insurance salesman, but that's not quite who I was looking for. Well, maybe I do, that candle in my place looks like it might turn my first floor into a Trial of Fire at any time, especially the way it always seems to be lit when I walk in the room, even if I put it out last time I was there.</p>

<p>I don't know what it is with the rest of you guys and sleeping, but I wasn't able to visit till real late last night, when I needed my beauty sleep. Bret brought me over some pears before I followed him back to his stomping-grounds for a brief visit (his shop had a bug net in stock, which I desperately need). And boy, is there some bizarre crap going on over there. I swear, time flows differently over there for some reason; when I'd stuck my head in earlier, it was a cool fall, and mere hours later, it's snowing furiously, the trees have turned white... yeesh.</p>

<p>Personally, I suspect Bret's in possession of some sort of time-travel device. Not that I'm too keen on that sort of thing myself; I like to take things as they come. Relax a little. Yeah, that's the ticket.</p>

<b>Behold The Power Of Bees</b> Matt @ 3:50pm

<p>So, bug net in hand, I set out today to capture a few prime specimens for the museum. Only problem is, there don't actually seem to be any bugs in my town. Just a few days ago, I couldn't walk three steps without hearing buzzing and seeing something flitter away; now there's nothing.</p>

<p>Well, if the bugs won't come to me, I'll find them. So I started shaking trees to see if any had a bee's nest inside. It's dangerous work, but it's all in the name of science.</p>

<p>Problem is, these bees are hella fast. In my old town, I was able to run, grab my net, about-face, and nab the buggers reasonably easily. I can't even get my net out here before they swarm me and leave me with a rearranged face.</p>

<p>I suspect the key here is to get someone to come visit and shake the trees for me while I man the net. At least, I'm hoping that'll work. I have to leave town to do some transacting in an open shop anyway, so I'll give it a shot later tonight.</p>

<b>My Blue Room</b> Matt @ 4:38pm

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld_blue-room.jpg" style="float: right">Well, while I'm waiting for the rest of the crew to wake up, so I can do some shopping, I had a photograph taken of myself and my lovely blue-themed room. Don't you wish you had digs like mine? Of course you do.</p>

<b>Matt, Your Hair!</b> Karen @ 5:23pm

<p>Woke up this evening and found that Matt had a new Samurai wig (see picture from his Blue Room post). I'll have to post a picture of me with my Geisha wig... hey, maybe we can change this blog to The Adventures of the Geisha and Samurai in a Wild World; I'll get top billing, of course, 'cause it's all about me!</p>

<p>With Nook's shop closed, I spent time with my animal friends. We have a new resident named Elvis. Elvis seemed to like me a lot, he told me his sign right off the bat. By the way, he's a Leo. Peanut had me run over to Goose's with a gift. Goose doesn't really like Peanut's gifts, but I tell Peanut that he loves them anyway; maybe that's why she keeps sending him gifts. Well, at 500 bells a gift for delivery service, of course I'm going to tell her he loves them! Bones seems to be quite enamored with Matt. Bones was sporting a shirt that was designed by Matt. Bones had quite the blush going on when he told me that when he heard the design was by Matt he HAD to have it. I sent Bones a letter later on "Matt's mine, you can't have him. Don't make me pound you!" We'll see if that helps.</p>

<p>Got a new friend code today, Travis was kind enough to let a poor friendless girl visit his town, Krypton. He didn't say much, must be the strong silent type. I swapped a few patterns at the Able Sisters shop; however, I did not post the famous Hot Stuff pattern that I wear on my hat. Speaking of that, Katrina was giving fortunes in Krypton today. I had her give me a compatibility reading on Goose, seems that we have a lot in common; maybe that's why he's proudly sporting my Hot Stuff pattern. I enjoyed talking to the animal residents of Krypton and sent Travis a thank you letter before I left.</p>

<p>Oh yeah... Matt, we have to talk about the blue room... now, I love blue, but boy is that room blue!</p>

<b>Gone Fishin'</b> Travis @ 7:35pm

<p>Yesterday was a fine day. I spent most of my time fishing on the river. Punchy and I actually held a few contests to see who could catch a certain type of fish first. He won once, but I remain the fishing master, as he says.</P>

<p>I'm amazed at how many different kinds of fish there are in Krypton. I dare say I could've lived the life of a fisherman and been content. It's quite soothing.</p>

<p>Later in the evening I noticed more scandalous mayhem. Punchy talked to Dora and got exceedingly happy and then I saw Dora talk to Gaston, who became quite sad. Is it possible that Dora broke up with Gaston to entertain the thought of being with Punchy? I do not know, but it seems odd to me that a mouse and a cat would like to be together at all.</p>

<p>This morning I awoke to find a new resident in town. Her name is Annabelle and she seems to be an ant eater of sorts. She's very polite, but a bit quirky for my tastes. She did, however, offer to let me look around her house while she was unpacking. This is something Yuka wouldn't do the day before. Speaking of which, I went to see her next and she had finally settled into her new home. I find her quite rude, however, and am hoping she'll move away.</p>

<b>More Time Travel</b> Dean @ 8:40pm

<p>So Nook's shop is closed in my town too (This guy has many clones, can we say Mini-Me?), I ended up meeting with Matt and Travis on a walk and we went to visit another town, one we hadn't been to before. It was called Xanadu, really weird place... but, Nook's was open and I was able to grab a shovel, but not before we ran in to Craaaazy Redd! He wanted a password (psst, it's "but I have cash") and then he wanted three grand to join his club... I dunno what kind of 'club' he's talking about, but I bet Nook is a member, if ya catch my drift.</p>

<p>Regardless, after running around the peach orchards of Xanadu, I returned back to N-Sider to catch up on town happenings... Elmer asked me if I thought Lobo and Victoria were gettin it on, and I said that there was 'lotsa smootchin' goin on, and I think he got mad at me... perhaps he's got a thing for Victoria? I dunno, the animals are crazy at night.</p>

<p>Oh well, can't wait to see what Nook's shop looks like tomorrow, perhaps I'll be able to find an axe to cut down someone's trees, mwha ha ha ha ha!</p>
