<b>A Pictorial Tour</b> Matt @ 5:05am

<p>So, with Nook expanding again (I blame the spike in business he got last night as Niwa sort of turned into an entertainment hub of sorts), I decided to take everyone on a brief photo tour of some of the highlights of my place.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld_my-pad-markii.jpg" style="float: right;">This is what my pad looks like right now -- sort of a cacophony of styles and such. It's really difficult to get a consistent style going, as the bits and pieces available to me are such a grab bag that it's a miracle if I find two matching pieces. Oh yeah, when I was taking this shot, Peanut came to the door; I gave her a "sit tight" look, but I guess she didn't get it, because a minute later she noted she'd been standing there too long, and took off. Well, I guess I'll have to smooth that over later.</p>

<p style="clear: right;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld_palm-tree.jpg" style="float: right;">This here is my little baby palm tree, the lone one in my town, growing on the beach. I was hanging out in Hyrule when I spotted a coconut on the beach; Bret let me take it back with me since he already had a few. Since that day, my tree's growing but none of his has taken root. So I'm giving him first dibs on fruit off this tree.</p>

<p style="clear: right;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld_help.jpg" style="float: right;">This is probably the highlight of our town right now. Karen put this together the course of a couple hours yesterday; I touched it up with a couple more shells last night. Everyone, including <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/">NintyGal</a>, who came by thought it was hilarious. Though I sometimes wonder exactly what Karen was trying to get across here...</p>

<p>Oh yeah, NintyGal. I got an otherworldly communication from her yesterday, asking me if she could drop by my little town. Once Dean, Travis, and she arrived, though, Copper decided I was making the place far too much of a party haven, and refused to let anyone else in, much to Bret's chagrin. Oh well, she brought us some cherries. Hoo-rah!</p>

<b>Intrigue</b> Travis @ 10:24am

<p>If you may recall, I rescued a lost child the other day by the name of Katie. I took her to her mommy, Kaitlin, in N-Sider (Dean's town). Well this morning I got a letter from Kaitlin of thanks complete with a present. The present in question was a gigantic teddy bear. It's very nice and I'd take a picture if I had a suitable camera.</p>

<p>This morning I also ran into Lyle. He's apparently an insurance salesman and a seedy one at that. He makes me very nervous. His sales pitches were filled with subtle threats. I wonder if he's linked to the mafia. He certainly seems linked to Crazy Redd in some way. Luckily I did not have any money on me at the time or I fear he would've wrangled me into some scheme.</p>

<p>The flea market today was not very exciting. I couldn't find anything I actually wanted to purchase. Maybe next time. A lot of residents came by my house today though, but I didn't actually want to sell anything. I did end up parting with my lawn chair, however, but only for a measly 600 bell. Yuka simply would not buy it for my initial asking price of 9,999,999 bell.</p>

<b>Flea Market Schmee Market</b> Matt @ 12:00pm

<p>Someone sold my bird.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my room thinking it's awfully quiet, and it hits me.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose I can buy a new one tomorrow.</p>

<b>Re: Matt's Bird</b> Karen @ 5:17pm

<p>I wouldn't have sold Matt's bird if he hadn't made Nook's close for the day. A girl needs bells to spend, so I sold his furniture and at a good profit I might add. Besides, it was looking weird in there, an interior design explosion!</p>

<p>Speaking of explosion, we seem to be having an epidemic amongst the animals. They are getting sick one by one. If Nook's wasn't closed, I could buy the poor dears some medicine. Maybe that's why our new resident, Alice is moving already. She didn't even get around to unpacking her boxes.</p>

<b>Dance Party In N-Sider!</b> Dean @ 8:15pm

<p>So I had Matt, Bret, and Ferquin over for a dance party... the only thing is, my house wasn't big enough to fit everyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wildworld-group.jpg" style="float: right;">Also, we got together and took a group picture.  Left to right: Ferquin, Dean, Bret, Matt.</p>

<p>Things go crazy on K.K. Slider night!</p>

<b>Saturday Night Fever!</b> Bret @ 8:45pm

<p>So a couple of us got together with Dean and had a dance party! It was almost trippy, as one master soccer player commented. I would have to agree, since I spun around so much that I began to wonder if it was me or the room that was spinning. We then took some pictures. I am the nerdy kid in the wizard hat. And yes, I did spend time grooming my image!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I paid off my mortgage the other day. Its a good thing, too, because I was starting to dislike that little house and wanted to expand. Luckily, ol Tom Nook was up to the task, and decided he could expand my house for a fee. Now that I dont have steady work, it might be tough to pay it off this time, but I have a few things that I can do for cash.</p>

<p>One thing that I have decided is that I will begin a restoration project in Hyrule. I was floored when I saw the amazing floral display at Puddless house, so I will be creating my own flower garden. I have also noticed that the fruit trees around Hyrule are a tad... random... so I have been in the process of creating a few orchards. Hopefully this will bring in cash as well as beautify the town. I have planted 5 fruits so far, but none of my coconuts took root.</p>

<p>After working on the orchard tonight, I think I might have a good cup of coffee by my fire. There are a few animals I would like to thank, and I think Ill write them letters. I also need to start thinking of what I want to get my pals for Christmas! So much to do, so little time.</p>
