<b>A Ride Into Town</b> Matt @ 7:52am

<p>Well, about 11:00 my time, the taxi rolled up, ready to take me to my new home in Niwa. I recognized the driver right away as the singing amphibian who used to take me on trips to the island back in my old homestead. Well, at least this time around he didn't subject me to another one of his tunes. Asked a ton of questions, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, he drops me off at town hall, and first thing I do is hop in and have a chat with Pelly. She's a curious gal herself. Apparently, she was expecting me &mdash; Tom Nook told her I was coming in.</p>

<p>Whoa, sorry there, just had an involuntary shudder. Where was I?</p>

<p>Ah, yes, Nook. Pelly tells me he's got a place set up for me. Looking at the town map, it looks like it's in its own area with a lot of surrounding room, which is cool. Two of my new neighbors, Peanut and Bones, live nearby; Goose lives waaay out in the southwest corner of town. Actually, he's got a nice looking place, near the beach.</p>

<p>Well, that's enough for the moment. I'm going to check out my new digs. Will write later!</p>

<hr>
<b>Work, Work, Work</b> Matt @ 8:19am

<p>So Nook's got me running all over town in some wack uniform... first he wants me to plant flowers and trees. Can't say I'm all that thrilled, but at least they're free, for now. I remember town beautification efforts cost me quite a bit in my old town, but it was worth it to keep my old pal Joey around.</p>

<p>So, this Peanut gal, first thing out of her mouth is that she loves gardening. Gardening? It's nice, I guess, and I like to make the town look pretty too, but it's hardly an opening line, y'know? Well, we'll see how long she sticks around, heh. Hopefully not long, as she's already called me a slacker.</p>

<p>Oh... Nook just gave me a delivery run. Will write more later. Hopefully I can break free of this job soon...</p>

<hr>
<b>Freedom!</b> Matt @ 10:41am

<p>That has to have been the shortest employment stint in history. Couple more deliveries, a letter, an advertisement by town hall, and... done.</p>

<p>It's cool, though, because now I can chill out a little bit. Nook took my salary and applied it immediately to my house payment rather than leave me with any spending money, for which I intend to thank him later. Yes... thank him.</p>

<p>So, for now, I'm going to set about getting some cash and then some tools, and with any luck, I'll be hearing from some friends that I can visit later on today. Wish me luck!</p>

<b>Brave New World</b> Travis @ 1:40pm

<p>Once my train ride had finished its journey around the world I came back to exactly where I had started. I did not want to move back to my old town and was prepared to continue riding the train until I heard of a place that fit my fancy. Unfortunately I received word from London that I was to go undercover in the city of Krypton. I was not too keen on this as it's a quiet town in the middle of nowhere that is, for some reason, inhabited by animals. I hailed a taxi and had him drive around a bit. The driver was named Kapp'n, an individual I knew quite some time ago in my old town. He captained a boat that would take the adventerous to a nearby island. It's nice to see him hold a real job.</p>

<p>He asked me many questions, but I found myself missing the ways he used to sing. Part of me wonders if the real world stress of a normal job has gotten to him somewhat. Still, he seemed cheery and he was all too happy to drop me off at my new home. I had decided during the drive where I wanted to live. He thought it was too out of the way, but I think, now that I've had time to relax here, I prefer it.</p>

<p>When I arrived I had no money or objects of possession. I had nothing, but the town had this wonderful system. Tom Nook, the local shopkeep, had a house available for me to live in. This put me in debt to him, but it was nice to have a place to call my own. Oddly enough, however, I worked for him a while in an attempt to pay him back, but he laid me off in less than an hour! I had done all of my duties quickly and efficiently to the point that he had no more work for me to do. He should just be paying me daily for the fact he has nothing to do. The nerve of him, to leave me out in the cold like this.</p>

<p>I spent the next hour picking some apples and selling them to him. I made a decent amount of money this way, but everything he sells is so expensive so I suppose it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>I got to meeet some great neighbors, however. Dora (a mouse) is quite nice, though was a bit suspicious of me when I first met her. Gaston is an old jerk, but something about his personality humors me. He seems to be quite into fossil hunting and has been trekking all over town with a shovel in hand. Punchy, a cat, is quite polite, but spends a lot of time indoors. I wonder about the cat.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's time for a nap. Picking apples is more work than I would have imagined. Plus I did some fishing earlier and I just need some rest.</p>

<b>Talk About Bad Hair Day!</b> Karen @ 2:49pm

<p>After a long hard day at work, I was ready to leave Spooky. Little did I know what fun I had in store. First, I got mugged; then, it started to rain. My only hope was a taxi driven by a quite forward little turtle named Kapp'n. Kapp'n gave me a ride in turn for a promise of a romantic dinner... *shudder* I got him, though, I stole his cute little dashboard statue! What made my day even worse was that my beautiful pink hair is now sprouting three ponytails - I can't wait until the barber comes into town, even if my head does get shaved!</p>

<p>Once I arrived in Niwa, I followed the directions Matt gave me. Upon entering the house, I headed upstairs to see Matt. There he was, my sweet sleeping prince, complete with knight helmet on his head; how cute. I considered shaving his eyebrows off, but thought better of it since he was nice enough to leave a shovel and fishing pole for me to use.</p>

<p>I have met the town residents and even had a chance to schmooze the mayor.</p>

<p>I'm ready to relax, fish, and snooze!</p>

<b>Customs? CUSTOMS?</b> Dean @ 2:57pm

<p>Man, I would have gotten to N-Sider earlier today, like at 3:00, but we got delayed in customs and then we missed our connecting train; so I had to buy another ticket for $16 just so I could get to N-Sider today. Oh well, nevertheless I got in and immediately Nook in his old ways put me to work. As much as I despise him, I had to give him credit for getting me a place real quick.</p>

<p>N-Sider sure has grown too, lots of new faces, lots of changes, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.</p>

<p>Anyways, off to meet some more of my new friends in town!</p>

<b>Hooray for Hats!</b> Karen @ 6:06pm

<p>Allright, I stopped by Mabel's shop and turned a pattern into a hat; hey, I look pretty cute in a hat &mdash; so cute I wrote Hot Stuff on it.</p>

<p>Dean came to visit me in Niwa. I had to laugh when he came strutting through the gates wearing his crown &mdash; he looked like he was the King of Niwa. We had a nice visit!</p>

<p>Dean invited me to visit N-Sider. I met a cute sheep who was really into clothes. Then, I picked up a Geisha Hat and Shades at Mable's. The Geisha Hat turns my pink hair into pink Geisha hair &mdash; pretty cool!</p>

<p>I had brought some of my apples to sell at Nook's in N-Sider and took some peaches to bury in Niwa.</p>

<p>I took Matt's shovel with me when I traveled to N-Sider, planted an apple and found a fossil; the good angel and bad angel had a long conversation about what to do with the fossil. The good angel won, so I dropped the fossil on the ground for Dean to pick up &mdash; it's the least I can do after stealing his peaches.</p>

<p>I would stayed in beautiful N-Sider longer, but Matt really wanted to wake up, and well... it is his house so I guess I better go to sleep.</p>

<p>Can't wait to Go Wild again... hope Matt gets tired soon. You are getting sleepy... sleeeppyyy...</p>
