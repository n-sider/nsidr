<p><b style="font-size: 20px">N-Sider Goes Wild</b><br><i>Feature by <a href="staff.php">N-Sider Staff</a></i></p>

<p>Six guys, aged 15 to 28.  Six car rides from a squinty amphibian.  Six brand-new towns situated around the world, each with their own set of animal residents with big heads.  Six homes to move into and decorate.  Countless visits and tit-for-tat revenge sought for tree-chopping vandalism.</p>

<p>One place to read all about it for nearly a week before you are able to play the game for yourself.</p>

<p>N-Sider is proud to bring to you the adventures of six of our staff writers as they get their hands on Nintendo's watershed new game, bringing the idyllic paradise of <i>Animal Crossing</i> out of the television set, into your hands, and out into the Wild World.  This is our live coverage of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a>, brought to you in a way that only N-Sider can.</p>

<p>Written from the perspective of our in-game selves, we aren't here to tell you about which routers work best, how well-animated the characters are, or even how much easier it is to sell a pocketful of fossils to Nook with the stylus.  What we're here to tell you is the story of what we're doing in our towns, our interactions with our town residents, and the fun we're having visiting each other.</p>

<p>We have had and are having a blast writing about our adventures over at <a href="http://wild.n-sider.com/">wild.n-sider.com</a>.  Keep visiting us to keep up on our adventures, and <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=2941">drop by our forums</a> to let us know what you think.</p>

<p>We hope you have enjoyed and are still enjoying this unique coverage of what will no doubt prove to be one of Nintendo's memorable releases.  But, above all, we hope to see you drop by for a visit!</p>
