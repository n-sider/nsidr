<p><b style="font-size: 20px">N-Sider Goes Wild: Day 4</b></p>

<b>Luckily I Didn't Have To Drive The Whole Journey</b> Conor @ 12:46am

<p>I sure am glad that Kapp'n fellow drove me the rest of the way. I just know my stomach wouldn't have held out for long enough. And throwing up on somebody else's lawn isn't the best way to say 'Hello'. In fact I think it's a sign of loathing in some cultures. Or at the very least, I wouldn't be suprised. But anyway, Kapp'n is one hell of a guy; quite a character. Although he does seem to take 'International Talk Like A Pirate Day' <em>way</em> too seriously. He kept asking me all these questions. Frankly by the end of it I was wondering if he was just being friendly, or if he would sniff my hair once I got out.</p>

<p>Luckily though, he didn't and I was left as the brand new citizen of the town of Lufia. It's actually not that bad a place once you know your way around: Nice people, nice scenery. Shame my house is smaller than a matchbox though. But Tom Nook says he can expand it, once I pay off the debt.</p>

<p>And what a debt it is! I've never owed this much money in my life! Either I really am destitute, or Nook's one crafty character. I'd have to say it's the latter, personally. So to pay for my new matchbox, he got me to run a few little errands for him. Nothing major, just deliveries and a few letters. But gosh, that guy is just so arrogant! I know he runs a succesful store but he's no Bill Gates, even though he acts like it.</p>

<p>That's been my first day so far though. I managed to come out of it with a new floor and a new table too! Which is great, except they look terrible together. Why anyone would match a grapefruit design and a paraquet carpet, I'll never know. Except that I'm doing that right now.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<b>My First Night On The Town</b> Conor @ 4:24am

<p>...was spent picking fruit off of trees. I know, I should be out celebrating, but I have a massive debt to pay off. Which means I'm going to have to put in a lot of manhours if I want to free myself of monetary troubles. Actually, it was pretty fun after a bit. Not only did I pick a hell of a lot of apples, but some flowers and some shells too. I even caught a fish! Admittedly, it was a pretty terrible-tasting fish, but Nook bought it, so at least I got a good good profit. Heh, sucker.</p>

<p>I got to know the townspeople a bit more too. Bella can't stop talking; which would be OK if she didn't have the face she does. I swear, someone got beaten around with the ugly baton a bit as a child. Still, she's a kind enough person, so there you go. Then there's Yuka, who constantly complains about the temperature, and Cesar, who has enough furniture to feed Ethiopia for a year. But I can forgive them these minute flaws, they're still plenty cool.</p>

<p>And when I went into the Civic Centre that night to pay back a part of my mortgage, boy did I get a suprise! Pelly had left her post, and had been replaced by a new clerk called Phyllis. I guess people can't be expected to work 24/7. But the biggest suprise was Phyllis muttering insults about me. She might not have though I could hear them, but to not hear them would require earplugs. That bird is just cruel.</p>

<b>Agent S? Anyone?</b> Matt @ 7:31am

<p>Everyone went to Xanadu and <em>nobody mentioned Agent S</em>? You know, the secret-agent squirrel guy? Man, that guy was awesome. If my memory serves me, we were all thoroughly impressed by the li'l guy, demanding he move to our town immediately.</p>

<p>Well, I for one will be back to Xanadu with gifts to attempt to pry him out and transplant him. That squirrel <em>must</em> live in my town!</p>

<hr>
<b>Re: Agent S</b> Dean @ 10:56am

<p>Oh yea Matt? Well he sent me a letter, he made sure I got back to N-Sider alright... if he moves anywhere, it'll be my town! I'm his sidekick, or at least that's what he calls me.</p>

<p>Anyways, here's his letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi There, Dean,</p>

<p>If you're reading this, it means you got home safe! It's sad, but I'm always free. So drop by, will you!</p>

<p>Agent S, Xanadu</p></blockquote>

<b>Niwa at Daytime</b> Karen @ 11:09am

<p>I've been walking around so much at night that the animals were beginning to think I was a vampire. Matt kindly let me wake up so that I could enjoy Niwa during the day.</p>

<p>Nook's had a net for sale. I caught my first Niwa Cockroach &mdash; how exciting. There were many fish out today, so I kept myself busy trying to catch those suckers.</p>

<p>Crazy Redd was in town today! I became a member of his little shop and promptly bought an amazing painting that looks fantastic in the museum. I also found and donated a fossil.</p>

<p>I did a few more patterns today. I was feeling in a winterish mood, so I made a snowman pattern. I placed the pattern on the ground in a few spots for everyone to enjoy. Mabel had a king's beard on sale today; made me think of Dean a.k.a. "King of Niwa". If I make enough money to buy it (8,000 Bells), I'll find a way to send it to him.</p>

<p>Bones seems to have gotten the message about Matt, even stopped wearing the shirt Matt designed. It seems that he is now stalking Peanut; he's even talking about marriage!</p>

<p>I can't forget poor Elvis. He sent me a desperate letter and signed it "I'm a loner, Elvis". My heart just broke. We did have Alice move into town today and I found out that she's a Leo as well. Perhaps those two lonely hearts will hook up. What a soap opera!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Agent S, Matt can't stop talking about him. I think there may be an Agent S fan club starting soon.</p>

<b>Curse ye, Dean!</b> Travis @ 12:01pm

<p>Yesterday, as has been mentioned, a bunch of us went to a town known as Xanadu. It was a fun time and I enjoyed it immensely. The main resident there was named Ferquin. He and I went fishing together.</p>

<p>I met a resident there by the name of Agent S. He just moved in, but I know exactly why. He's my foreign contact for this town. Clearly he's a member of French intelligence. According to plan, after gathering more information, he's supposed to move to Krypton so that we can form a base of operations, but I am weary that he'll be persuaded by Matt, Dean, and more to move to their towns. They seem to be attempting to bribe him and I was forced to send him a gift just to keep him on the right track!</p>

<p>And that Dean, I space out for one moment and he digs holes all around me! I was trapped! I had to wait for Ferquin to come and save me. Of course this is my own fault. I did not have my wits about me. I could have easily kicked dirt in the holes with my feet, but I just didn't think of it. how embarassing.</p>

<hr>
<b>Missing Child</b> Travis @ 1:57pm

<p>I was walking around Krypton today and I saw this little girl cat. She was crying a lot. Apparently, she was lost! She told me she needed her mommy, that she needed to be taken back to the town of N-Sider. Why, that's where Dean lives!</p>

<p>I offered to take her to her town, she sure did cry a lot on the way though. Anyway, I made it to N-Sider and her mom was waiting at the town's gate. She was so mad at her daughter, but so relieved at the same time. She thanked me profusely and was then on her way. I was a bit surprised I didn't get a gift, I mean people in my town will give me 500 bells just for walking two feet to deliver something and I returned this cat's child.</p>

<p>Her name was Kaitlin so I thought I'd go to her house and check on things. Well it turns out she doesn't even live in N-Sider! I talked to Dean about it and he was confused. I secretly think he's behind it. Was this some kind of plan to lure me away from my town? What deeds were done while I was away?</p>

<hr>
<b>Captain's Log</b> Dean @ 6:11pm

<p>I think they're on to me. I've been too lax in my plans for global wild domination. Travis is too suspecting, something must be done about him.. Yes... Something... And I ran into a wanderer in Niwa, named NintyGal, she knew of my evil axe plans... er I mean, what axe plans? THERE ARE NO AXE PLANS.</p>

<p>I must be more careful, if my evil plan is to succeed, I will need to take great care and work stealthily to achieve my goal.</p>

<p>Diary, you better not tell anyone.</p>

<b>Much To My Suprise, The Flea Market Had No Fleas For Sale</b> Conor @ 10:17pm

<p>Upon getting out of bed this morning, I was greeted by a guy called Lyle. He claimed to be an accident insurer. "Great, there's even door-to-door salesmen out here." But this guy was worse. He just wouldn't take no for an answer. He would keep repeating the same statement over and over until eventually I cracked and gave him the 3,000 Bells he wanted. I'd better fall down some stairs or something; because I really want to teach that crook a lesson.</p>

<p>Two new people arrived in town today, a dog called Walker and a mouse called Alice. I'm pretty happy actually; I hate being the new guy in anything. But ooh, ooh! Cesar told me that he'e heard rumors about Bella and Walker!</p>

<p>Wait a minute.</p>

<p>Eww.</p>

<p>Anyway, as the title suggests today was Flea Market day. Not really being a bug collector, I thought I'd sit this one out. Instead, I went over to Yuka's to say hi. Lo and behold, she was selling off some of her unwanted goods. "Aha!" I thought, "<em>This</em> must be what the Flea Market is!" So excited as I was, I picked up a ringside table and took it on home. I do love my wrestling, you know. Then, while deciding where to put the thing, Bella walks in and starts looking at my stuff! I didn't know I was selling as well! But, being the gracious host I am, I let her buy my grapefruit table. After all, that has no wrestling practicality.</p>

<p>I also bought a shovel from Nook and got digging. I managed to find two fossils. Blathers took them under his wing gladly, but I didn't get anything for them. I was hoping for at least a complimentary tote bag but no, nothing. Last time I give stuff to them, those lousy chepskates. Although I did check out the observatory there. I said Celeste was "cute". She ended up sweating a lot. Ah, good times.</p>

<p>Then after a quick power-nap, I went outside to find a mole had dug a tunnel into my frontyard. This guy was crazy, I swear: He kept going on about something called <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i> and something called <i>Nintendo</i>. It's probably a snackfood or something. And then he told me to press my Start button. WHAT BUTTON, MOLE? WHAT FREAKING BUTTON?</p>

<p>So after all this fuss, I went on down to the beach to fish for a bit. Didn't catch anything but as fishermen say, "It's not about catching the fish."</p>

<p>Then what <em>is</em> it about?</p>
