<p><b style="font-size: 20px">N-Sider Goes Wild: Day 0</b></p>

<b>Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday!</b> Dean @ 6:25pm

<p>Tuesday is the big day! I'll be moving into N-Sider with nothing in tow! No money, no car, and just the clothes on my back; it's as exciting as it was when I first moved into the town. You see, three years ago when I first moved to N-Sider, the town was so different, simpler even. Tom Nook forced me into buying a house and working for him; I'm not much of a gardener but hey, it was a living. I remember when Kapp'n would take me to Universe Island, it was always a nice retreat and calm fishing hole, I wonder how much it's changed.</p>

<p>You may have caught that I'm moving back to N-Sider, see, after I had paid off Tom Nook, he started giving me really weird looks; I couldn't quite put a finger on the problem until I got this letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Dean,</p>

<p>It's been a while since you've stopped by my shop, I have some of the most precious and beautiful shirts that I'd love you to model for me! I just bought a new camera and I think you'd make the perfect model, okay sweetie?</p>

<p>See you soon I hope!</p>

<p>Tootles,<br>
-Nookywooky</p></blockquote>

<p>It made me move away and just drift for a few years; but, I'm giving it a second chance, and Tuesday is the day I return to the home that I made for myself in N-Sider... I've been hearing there have been a few changes to my old hometown, so it'll be nice to walk on my old stomping grounds.</p>

<p>Until Tuesday.</p>

<b>The Day Before</b> Matt @ 3:06am

<p>Whoa, what are the odds? Tomorrow's my big day too.</p>

<p>As for me, I'm leaving behind this little square town of mine, with its residents that always want me to deliver, deliver, deliver. It was fun for awhile, and Karen didn't seem to mind it much; I guess I always just felt like there had to be more to the residents' lives. I hear the residents in my new stomping-grounds are considerably more interesting folk.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, Karen. She's going to be living with me for about a week. There aren't a whole lot of us who are able to get into our towns just yet, so while she waits, she'll be staying in my digs briefly. She's got her own reasons for moving, but I think I"ll just let her explain those later.</p>

<p>I'm having a real hard time waiting for tomorrow, though. For months now, I've been digging up as much as I can about it. The biggest thing I'm thrilled about, of course, is the availability of transit. I mean, the place I'm living now, the train only goes to Karen's town. Which is nice and all, but I'm looking for more. This new place has moved out of the 19th century with transportation options, and I'll be able to visit a ton of friends.</p>

<p>What else... oh yeah, the holidays. Living in this place is going to feel like living in a whole new country. For example, "La-Di-Day". Apparently this gets the residents all worked-up, running around singing songs to whoever they can corner, and demanding they choose their song as the town's new jingle. There's also an Acorn Festival, where this bizarre-yet-strangely-familiar character with a gigantic acorn for a face trades you acorns for fungi... yeah, I really don't get it either, but I know I'll have a blast trying it out.</p>

<p>Anyway, I suppose I should cut this short now; I could go on all day, but I've got some loose ends to tie up before I make my triumphant landing in the new place tomorrow. Wish me luck!</p>

<b>The Long Train Ride</b> Travis @ 10:23am

<p>This is the longest train ride ever. I left my old home when my darling Cookie had left me. She said we'd be together forever and she just... left. I suppose I neglected her somewhat, but I had a job that took me out of town often. I was not able to wander the town all the time to talk to everyone and deliver items. I'm a spy, and a good one at that and I can't walk around all day without any cover. Besides, she burned me so many times. She talked about being my date during the Harvest Moon, but she never showed up. She even talked about playing chess or catching bugs together, but she was always sitting just outside her house, staring at the beach. When she left I only got a simple letter from her in the mail that explained her absence. And she left me to go see a friend of mine who had just recently visited! That was the last straw. Of course, in my haste, I forgot to take everything that I owned so now I'm homeless and poor! I've been in this situation before though so I'm confident I can get back on my feet.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having now is that this train ride has lasted for 45 days so far. It seems I wanted to move just a couple towns over, but I took the train in the wrong direction and am now going around the world. I'm meeting all sorts of new people on the train through. It truly is a wild world out there! They gave me some information so that I could get in contact with them when I got settled, but truthfully I don't even know where I'm headed yet. All I know now is that I'm not too keen on settling in the north pole and simply must get back to a more casual climate.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a town that will let me do more to my wardrobe, in all honesty. As a spy I often need to conceal my identity while maintaining a suave presence to woo double agents into giving me information. My old town did not let me do much, but I've heard of some nice places that will have hats and even hair salons. Now if I ever get tracked down by the enemy I can change my appearance on the fly in lieu of having to move.</p>

<p>I suppose for now I'll settle in a town when the feeling strikes me. I don't know where exactly I'm going and the train ride is so long. I have all the time in the world to make a decision and all the free snacks on this train that I could desire.</p>

<b>The One in Which I Move To A New Town</b> Conor @ 1:01pm

<p>Cars always make me sick. It's not opinion; it's fact. Seriously, I can't go a few miles without wanting to throw up. Normally it isn't a big deal, as I don't tend to travel much. But today is different: I'm travelling 200 miles today, and already I want to eject the contents of my stomach. I guess there's nothing for it; like I said, I have 200 miles to traverse and I can't be throwing up the whole time.</p>

<p>I might not be feeling all too great right now, but that doesn't mean I can't be excited. After all, I'm moving to a new town! Yippee! Hooray! New people, new places, new experiences, and I'm always one for adventure. Even if it means <em>grievous bodily harm</em>. So, despite the current scenario I'm still predicting today will be a good day. Actually, I'm quite glad I've skipped town. A lot of people will say that being close to your family is a great thing. They obviously haven't met my family. I mean, I thought Glad Wrap was clingy, but that stuff has nothing on my folks.</p>

<p>It's amazing actually, I have no idea what the town I'm moving to is called either. In fact, I know little or nothing about the town itself. All I know is that there's a house there with my name on it, and damned if I'm going to miss out.</p>

<p>So, weather (stomach) permitting, you'll find me in ____ tomorrow.</p>

<p>Wish me luck.</p>

<b>Play Goes Wrong, Animals Stampede Human Resident</b> Karen @ 6:36pm

<p>At a performance of George Orwell's "Animal Farm", performers got angry when Matt, human resident of the town, heckled them too much. "I guess he got bored," says Matt's roommate, Karen, "but he carried his boredom a bit too far when he began to shoot the animals with his slingshot." Matt is survived by his parents who couldn't be contacted for further comment.</p>

<p>Okay, so that's not what my first day is going to be like in my new town, but I got your attention didn't I?</p>

<p>I am almost ready to go. I'm looking forward to meeting my roomie, Matt. Can't wait to explore and do new things &mdash; I hope the barber doesn't shave my head! Can't wait to fish, catch bugs, garden, shop, meet new animal and human friends, and make all the animals say "Matt Drools" when they talk. Gosh, I hope Matt isn't reading this.</p>

<p>Well, I better get packed and find my train tickets.... what's the name of the town I'm moving into again? I'll have to ask Matt, if he's still talking to me.</p>
