<H3>The Buzz: Edition #1</H3>



<p>Welcome to the return of <i>The Buzz</i>, an intersecting plane where the latest rumors and news meet for an interesting read. To commemorate our first edition since our relaunch, we start off by taking a look at the imminent software roster.



<p><b>Where's the GameCube software</b>?<br>A question everyone is asking right now. It's not exactly very foretelling to look at a list of Playstation 2 to GameCube ports, and really get excited about the system's original software or graphic prowess. Fortunately, little by little developers are starting to receive GameCube kits and begin some GameCube specific projects. Some of the more prolific games will come from some of the big Japanese developers, we have come to learn SEGA, Capcom, and Konami,  are three of the big companies definitely announcing some very big projects as the new fiscal release year approaches (March 2002). Apparently, third party Japanese companies are very hesitant on supporting the GameCube until the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2002, most likely anticipating the GameCube's rather slow start. One thing we know for sure, SEGA will be pushing the GameCube modem with more than one game by the end of Summer.



<p><b>What about Nintendo?</b> Though tightlipped as ever, you'll be glad to know there are several unannounced projects in development. Topping the list is Nintendo themselves. Nintendo's two official Tokyo (Nd Cube) and Redmond subsidiaries (NST), have three titles on their way for 2002; unsurprisingly at least two (we suspect all three) are based on past franchises. 



<p>Furthermore, there are also two new Nintendo funded studios working on projects. While one is a <b>Japanese</b> company working on an undisclosed project, the other is a <b>European</b> company working on a big killer app. Ironically, one of the Spaceworld 2000 demos is directly connected to the highly recognizable head honcho of this new developer. The revelation has a lot to do with coming full circle, in more ways than one.
