Midway has <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/800/800090p1.html">revealed</a> to IGN that its classic arcade racing franchise will be heading exclusively to Wii. The series began in 1994 when <i>Cruis'n USA</i> hit arcades under license from Nintendo and has since seen three sequels: <i>Cruis'n Worlds, Cruis'n Exotica</i>, and <i>Cruis'n Velocity</i>. The last game, Velocity, was released for Gameboy Advance in 2001.<br />
<br />
The Wii-exclusive entry to the series is simply called <i>Cruis'n</i> and will feature a number of different cars with upgradeable and customizable turbos, neon displays, body kits, and nitrous boosters. Players race their cars through twelve different courses using the Wii remote. No more details were given.<br />
<br />
Midway also revealed a minigame collection in the same vein as <i>EA Playground</i>. Midway's collection, <i>Game Party</i>, will include over half a dozen games, such as darts, air hockey, and a trivia game.<br />
<br />
Both Cruis'n and Game Party are due out this coming November.
