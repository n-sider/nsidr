Nintendo has updated its Japanese website with information that reveals an expansion will be released for the interactive music game <i>Band Bros. DS</i>. According to PlanetGameCube, the "Band Brothers Zouka Kyoku Cartridge" will contain 20 additional songs.  The expansion will be released on a standard Game Boy Advance cartridge rather than a DS card.  Both the DS card and expansion GBA cartridge must be inserted at the same time to take advantage of the new songs.  More information will be released in late August. There is still no word on a North American release of <i>Band Bros.</i>.  The game's Japanese website can be found <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/abbj/barbarasama/index.html">here</a>.
