<p>This is somewhat related to yesterday's story regarding <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1621">independent video game retailers</a> and the difficult market they operate in.   The Escapist recently published the latest issue of its online <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/26/3">magazine</a>.  One of the pieces discusses how some retailers such as GameStop are relying on the sale of used games to make a profit since new software is failing to bring in the revenue.  It's an interesting dilemma and one that is highlighted in the following quote.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">"Videogames suffer from the shortest shelf life of any media. You can walk into a record store and buy CDs from the '60s, '70s, '80s and today. You can visit Barnes & Noble and pick up books written in the Renaissance. You can buy movies made in the black and white era. But you would be hard pressed to find a GameStop selling more than a handful of games older than a couple years, and the vast majority of shelf space will be for titles released in the last six months."</font></blockquote>

<p>It's hard to deny that something about this doesn't sound rosy.  Hopefully the retail model improves during the coming generation.  Perhaps Nintendo's virtual catalog of former titles and services such as <a href="http://www.gametap.com/home/Home?mcd=CMT10052005000456">GameTap</a> will help solve some of the ills of video game distribution that are currently facing both retailers and consumers.
