<p>Several websites indicate they will have the May 9 Nintendo press conference available live or for download shortly there after.  Expect N-Sider to have at least a live text version of the conference.  Server loads can be intense during the show, so be sure to bookmark each of the pages below for back-up.  We'll let you know of additional links as we find them.</p>
