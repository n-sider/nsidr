Majesco Entertainment announced yet another Nintendo title with <i>Furu Furu Park</i> for Wii. Originally released April 19 in Japan, it is now being brought over to America.<br />
<br />
Furu Furu Park is a collection of 30 arcade-style games. An example of some of the included games include reworkings of <i>Arkanoid</i> and <i>Bubble Bobble</i>, as well as Sonic Blastman 20XX, a continuation of the series for arcade and SNES. The games will take advantage of the Wii Remote's capabilities, such as the game Safe Cracker, where a combination must be memorized and the player tilts the remote left or right to unlock the safe.<br />
<br />
Developers Taito and 505 Games are also including three multiplayer modes to play against a friend: Free Battle, Panel Attack, and the chance to win a girl's heart in Love Challenge. Furu Furu Park is due for a fall release.
