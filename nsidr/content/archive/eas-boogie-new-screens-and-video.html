Vooks has posted <a href="http://www.vooks.net/modules.php?module=article&id=11714">brand-new screenshots and video</a> of Electronic Arts' Wii-exclusive dance title, <i>Boogie</i>.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3173-1.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="image_styled" /></div>The new media shows off what may be a somewhat different direction artistically for the title, which originally debuted in the form of screenshots showing vegetablish-looking creatures engaging in the titular boogie-ing.  It's also possible, since the press release says there are multiple "Boog" characters to choose from, that the new characters showcased are simply additions to the game's repertoire.<br />
<br />
Boogie's current claim to fame is that it also lets players sing using a now-confirmed microphone peripheral.  The game is slated for a release this year.
