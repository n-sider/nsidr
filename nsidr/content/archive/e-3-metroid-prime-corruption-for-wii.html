<p><ul>
<li>If you think you knew what it felt like to be the bounty hunter behind the visor, think
again. Take aim at evil with Nintendo's revolutionary controller.
<li>Players control Samus by moving with the Nunchuk controller and aiming with
the pointer, allowing for a level of immersion unlike anything they have ever
experienced. Through the eyes of Samus, players experience a quantum leap in
first-person control as they wield the Wii Remote, the ultimate device for the firstperson
shooter genre.
<li>Samus will employ well-known power-ups like the Grapple Beam and Morph
Ball, as well as a bunch of new surprises, to help her survive her coming trials.
<li>Game storyline: The Galactic Federation's Base Sector Zero is under attack by Space
Pirates. Samus must boot up the generator to restore the defense systems. But at the end
of her path, someone awful is waiting for her.
<li>Characters: Samus, Dark Samus, the Galactic Federation and many new bounty hunters.
How to progress through the game: The war initiated by Dark Samus and the Space
Pirates rages across many planets as they attempt to corrupt each with Phazon seeds.
Players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to explore alien landscapes, hunt for weapons
and information, and destroy the seeds. Saving the planets from Corruption isn't enough,
though. Eventually, players must take down Samus' mortal enemy, Dark Samus.
<li>Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Besides using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk
controllers to pull off amazing feats like aiming and blasting in midair or at a full run,
players also will have an array of different weapons at their disposal. In true Metroid
fashion, these will become powered up as the game progresses. Not only that, but the
controller will be used for a number of other game elements beyond the traditional firstperson
shooter standards.
