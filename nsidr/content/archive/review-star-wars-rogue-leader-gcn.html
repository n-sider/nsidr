<b>Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader</b><br>

<font size="1">2001 LucasArts</font>



<p>In late 1998, developers Factor 5 and LucasArts unleashed Star Wars: Rogue Squadron on the gaming public. The game was widely successful, and many gamers hoped for a sequel. Their prayers were answered when Lucasarts announced on May 10, 2001 that <i>Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader</i> would be released for the GameCube. For most parts of the game, you play as either Wedge Antilles or Jedi Luke Skywalker. In any case, you get to pilot a vast number of Rebel fighters in one of the most beautiful looking launch games on the GameCube.



<p><b>Features</b>

<ul>

<li>Scenarios, characters, vehicles from Original Trilogy

<li>Real-Time Environmental Effects

<li>Dolby Surround 5.1 Pro Logic II

<li>Supports 480p progressive scan HDTVs

<li>Only for Nintendo GameCube

  </ul>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/7stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Stephen:</b> Rogue Leader is a terrific Star Wars shooter, featuring stunning graphics and sound. Factor 5 has done a commendable job of finally putting the gamer into the classic movies. However, I just can't shake the feeling that it could have been so much more. The controls are overly stiff, making your sleek X-Wing feel more like a Yugo. The mission objectives lack any real depth or scope; you get the feeling that you are playing chunks from the movies, not taking part in a massive campaign against the Empire. Despite the great tecnical quallity, the overall package struck me as unpolished.<p>



Don't get me wrong...Rogue Leader is a fun game. The Battle of Endor is worth the price of admission alone, and will likely have many gamers forgetting about the floaty controls or short game length. But the game as a whole lacks any real universal appeal; it clearly was made for the Star Wars faithful, and all non-fans need not apply.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/8stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Jason N:</b> Let me start off by saying I am not the biggest Star Wars fan. There I said it. I don't collect the Han Solo karate action figurines, or keep the movies on an endless loop in my room. I did however enjoy the original trilogy alot. With that being said, I wasn't caught up as much in the Rogue Leader hype.



<p>Thankfully the game has a solid presentation and some fun gameplay situations that live up to the good word the game has been getting. There are some things that I could complain about such as the jittery framerate in certain areas of the game. Or perhaps even the lifeless movements of the ships on the cutscenes. Truly though, the game is a great example of a next generation experience. The attention to detail really made my jaw drop sometimes. You definitely will have fun with this game, but where is the originality? That's right, there really isn't any. Most (if not all) of the on screen action is of course modeled after the movie counterparts which leaves you with the feeling that you're inside the movies. If that's what you crave then jump aboard. Myself, I'm sort of in between as to how I feel about that. I'll give it 8 stars.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/8stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Tim:</b> For a long time I didn't intend to buy Rogue Leader, as I thought it was simply a prettier Rogue Squadron. However, I eventually gave in as initial impressions were so positive.<p>



The graphics are excellent, but there's nothing you'll be too amazed with as you will have seen most of it before, albeit at the movies. The music and sound effects are amongst the best I've ever encountered in a game, helping to immerse you in the Star Wars universe. I feel that one of Rogue Leader's main strengths is that it's a hard game, yet rarely becomes infuriating, you always feel you can beat the level if you persevere. However, although the gameplay is good, it's nothing we haven't seen before, although perhaps not on this scale. The difficulty of the levels seems strange too, some of the earlier levels are far more tricky than some of the later ones, even when I go back and play them now. Special mention must go to the host of extras the Factor 5 have put into the game, it's these details that push it above the average game.<p>



So was it worth the purchase? Definitely. Is it in the same league as the Marios and Zeldas of gaming? I'm afraid not. It's a good game, but not the killer launch title so many of us would like. Though any game that features the phrase "Spank the monkey!" said in a German accent must be a welcome addition to your games library. Right?



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/8stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Anthony P:</b> Rogue Leader has arrived carrying the moniker killer app, but beware the hype machine. Bearing more than a passing resemblance to the Factor5 Rogue Squadron games of yester year, it shouldnt take long to adjust to the controls if youve handled those X shaped fighters before. In this 2002 update of the franchise the controls seem a lot tighter than before, the GameCube controller performing perfectly with this type of game. The controls become your best friend or your worst enemy when it comes to this aspect of the title. You will find it either improves your dog fighting skills or it ends up an ultimate annoyance.



<p>Controls aside, the real attraction to Rogue Leader are its good gosh golly! visuals. This is made almost immediately apparent from the moment you find yourself travelling down a claustrophobia-inducing trench at an uncomfortable pace. Its a shame the frame rate isnt as smooth as the textures though. Flying near the beautiful waters of Kothlis, you feel like your almost torturing your purple box o joy with a hot knife as you stutter your way on to take out impending AT-ATs emerging from the watery depths. This occurs a few times during your intergalactic campaign but not frequent enough to bother you unless youre really finicky.



<p>Everything from the original John Williams orchestral soundtrack to the FMV movies in the options screens scream of an anal dedication to the Star Wars franchise, that much is evident from the start. Now, what many of you PAL gamers want to know is whether Rogue Leader runs at 60hz in its PAL form, and Im happy to report that it does. The game detects the 60hz mode automatically (it figures out whether your TV is 60hz compatible, very nice), and if that fails you can use it by holding down the <i>B</i> button upon start up, if you dont notice any difference then, you likely dont have the Official RGB cable that was released alongside the GameCube on launch day.



<p>Having sampled the delights of air-to-air combat at 60hz, I cant say that Ive seen an overwhelming difference between that and the enhanced 50hz mode. Factor5 have really rolled their sleeves up with this PAL conversion and have a final product worthy of anybodys GameCube. If you love the movies youll likely forgive the games flaws and love battling through the missions to get to the awe inspiring <i>Battle of Endor</i> sequence. Being a fan of the battles that took place in a galaxy far, far away myself, Rogue Leader took me through feelings of flight, fight and fancy. Rogue Leader is a solid interpretation of the Star Wars universe in video game form that no fan should be without but ultimately it's for the fans and by the fans of the trilogy. Star Wars fans, this is the bit when you run out the door and slam down your fifty notes...
