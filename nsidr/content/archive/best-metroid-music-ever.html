No disrespect to Kenji Yamamoto or Minako Hamano (the original composers of <i>Super Metroid</i>'s fright-pop soundtrack for the SNES), but this Brinstar remix deserves a virtual high-five. 
<br>
<br>
It's from a September issue of 4 Color Rebellion's mailbag (a relatively new link, actually -- the original dates back to April '04) -- board user "Rev" created the track exclusively for the site.

Dated as this (under-rated) mix is, checking it out might be the best thing you've done all day.
But... you don't have to take my word for it (cue Reading Rainbow butterflies).
