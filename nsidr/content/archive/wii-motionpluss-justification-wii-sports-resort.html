Nintendo showed off the justification for their new <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/wii-motionplus-1-1-adapter-for-wii-remote-unveiled">Wii MotionPlus</a> peripheral in their E3 press briefing today: <i>Wii Sports Resort</i>&#8212;and we've got <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6290&view=media">media</a>.<br />
<br />
NOA EVP Cammie Dunaway and president Reggie Fils-Aime used Remote and Nunchuk combos with the little white boxes attached to show off three new games which will make up at least a part of the new title:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Sword Play</b> lets you use the Wii Remote like a sword, mimicking your slashes on the screen while you chop blocks of wood or hack away at an opponent.</li>
  <li><b>Power Cruising</b> brought memories of Wave Race to mind as Reggie held the Remote in one hand and the Nunchuk in the other and mimicked steering a jetski.  (It wasn't really clear to me what the WiiMotion Plus was doing for him here, to be honest.)</li>
  <li>Finally, <b>Disc Dog</b> let you toss frisbees out to be retrieved by adorable Mii dogs.</li>
  </ul><br />
There'll be a single Wii MotionPlus packed in with Wii Sports Resort.  Additional units are expected to be sold separately.
