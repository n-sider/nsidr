Nintendo Power has put down April as the release date for Intelligent Systems' <i>Super Paper Mario</i> (which <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/">N-Forums</a> member Ferquin <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-super-paper-mario">previewed for us</a>), according to <a href="http://www.gwn.com/news/story.php/id/11021/title/Super_Paper_Mario_To_Hit_Wii_Early.html"> a report from GWN</a>.<br />
<br />
Nintendo Power has been wrong before, simply by virtue of having press deadlines for putting ink to paper&mdash;but with Wii's release lineup for spring presumably solidifying soon it seems likely April will see Super Paper Mario hit stores.  Stay tuned.
