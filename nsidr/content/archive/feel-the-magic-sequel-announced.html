<p>Today Sega announced a sequel to their Nintendo DS game <i>Feel the Magic</i>. The sequel is currently titled "Where Do Babies Come From" (in Japan), but that title is likely to change before it ever hits North American shores. In case you didn't know, the original title for <i>Feel the Magic</i> was "I Would Die For You" in Japan. Little else has been announced regarding this sequel.
