The Wii's unique motion-sensitive controller, the Remote, uses Bluetooth to communicate with the Wii console.  What Nintendo perhaps didn't foresee is that the Remote can also, with a little bit of nudging, be used to communicate with a Bluetooth-capable personal computer as well.<br />
<br />
Once you've got your Remote talking to your PC and have loaded Carl Kenner's <a href="http://carl.kenner.googlepages.com/glovepie">GlovePIE driver</a>, you can use the Remote to control your computer's mouse pointer.  Nintendo Gal <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/1328-Wii-Remote-Works-As-Mouse-Pointer.html">exhibits this being done</a> in video form.  Just from the video, it seems the motion-sensing functionality is being used, and not the Remote's infrared sensor&mdash;presumably, the latter would require pretty extensive custom programming.<br />
<br />
In addition to mouse-moving, the Bobcat's Bob Somers has created a program called <a href="http://www.bobsomers.com/2006/12/06/wii-drum-machine/">Wii Drums</a>, which purports to turn your PC and Wii Remote into a drum machine, not unlike the yet-unrealized-in-a-game sequence we saw in the original Wii videos.<br />
<br />
As homebrewers explore the various things they can do with the Remote, perhaps more cool hacks will be made available.  Though, hopefully, they won't result in yet more competition for the already-scarce supply of Remotes on store shelves.
