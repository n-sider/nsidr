<h3>Fresh Faces, Unseen Worlds</h3>

<p>Undeviating reliance on established brands cannot result in the new and original games Nintendo needs to compete in this day and age. <i>Pikmin</i> represents one of Nintendo's sole forays into original game development in recent years. It is both a fun and charming game. Imagine if you will, what <i>Pikmin</i> would have been like had Nintendo instead decided to create the game based on the <i>128 Marios</i> demo that it showed at Spaceworld 2001. Theoretically the two concepts are very similar, on a basic level. Sales would have been solid, being a title gracing the Mario name, but at what cost? The theme, characters, and world of <i>Pikmin</i> are what make the game so special. The quirky attitude and fun nature of it would have been lost had it not slipped through the cracks of Nintendo's rigorous brand association procedures. However, it was given the green light to exist and the creative imaginations of the brilliant minds at Nintendo were allowed to reign free. Because of this <i>Pikmin</i> is perhaps one of the most fun and exciting games to hit shelves this generation. Its sequel, <i>Pikmin 2</i>, only further develops and nurtures the originality and is one of the best games of the year.

<p><i>Pikmin</i> is but one of many examples I could use to illustrate this point. <i>Viewtiful Joe</i> is another. For all who have played it, <i>VJ</i> oozes character and imagination from every pore. Without a doubt, it is one of the most inventive and refreshingly entertaining titles to hit shelves in years. Nonetheless, Im sure that at one point or another Capcom pondered the possibility of making the game yet another offshoot of its Mega Man franchise. What if it had decided to go ahead and turn the game into a new Mega Man title? Im sure the resulting game would have probably been the best and most original Mega Man title in years. It probably would have outsold <i>VJ</i> as well, but at what cost? The magic that makes <i>Viewtiful Joe</i> so refreshing and fun would have been lost.

<p><i>Pokmon</i> is a prime example as well. Where would the Game Boy and Nintendo be today if it weren't for the phenomenal success of <i>Pokmon Red</i> & <i>Blue</i> in 1997? <i>Pokmon</i> almost single-handedly revived and rebuilt the Game Boy brand from the depths of stagnation. Nintendos biggest money making franchise today is a direct result of the company being open to a totally new game idea in 1996. The power of completely new game ideas cannot be underestimated. Historically, Nintendos biggest success stories have consistently coincided with the creation of completely new games.

<p>Perhaps, the largest success story of this generation would have to be <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> for the Xbox. The game continues to top the charts after nearly three years on the market. Why? Because it features polished gameplay and a completely original world and story; it was fresh, it was new, it was fun, and it was immersive. Bungie's <i>Halo</i> and upcoming <i>Halo 2</i> exemplify everything Nintendo hasn't. Nintendo doesn't have to create the next big mature title to return to greatness in the public eye, but it shouldn't shut the door before giving projects a chance either. <i>Viewtiful Joe</i> (Capcom) and <i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> (UbiSoft) represent two of my favorite games this generation. UbiSoft's <i>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</i> and <i>Splinter Cell</i> have also pushed the envelope and been met with critical acclaim. Even Sony has been one-upping Nintendo with innovative platforming hybrids like <i>Ratchet and Clank</i>, <i>Jak</i>, and <i>Sly Cooper</i>. 

<p>The bitter truth is that games like these would never come from the Nintendo of today. Right before its eyes, Nintendo has overseen its own diminishment. Its command over nearly every genre, of which it once held dominance, has been lost over the last two generations to competitors who have chosen to try something new. Some people play a game like <i>Fable</i> (XBX) and see a title that delivers few of its promises. I see a game that has barely scratched the surface of its potential. For I know how polished, alive, and amazing it could have been had Nintendo tried its hand at a title of its kind. Sadly, Nintendo is in the business of playing it safe. Developing completely original gaming worlds and concepts is not on its agenda. 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Nintendo has been playing it safe and relying on its past; two traits that it excels at greater than any other. For over 20 years it has been reworking, remaking, and reenergizing its core franchises, each time with immense success and critical acclaim. If the teams at Nintendo can still stretch and re-imagine 20 year old brands with such ease, it boggles the mind to fathom what kind of magic they could create if given the freedom to follow their creativity to the very epitome of imagination. Given an equal creative playing field, Nintendo has the inspiration and ingenuity to craft immersive and lively worlds beyond anything on the market today. I know this because I have known the Nintendo of yesteryear and I am intimately familiar with the Nintendo of today. What Id like to see is the Nintendo that looks ahead. A company that values its past, but treasures what lies around the corner even more.

<p>Mario, Link, Samus, and Donkey Kong would be nothing more than a couple of strange words had Nintendo not taken the risk on each and pushed the envelope in game design. Nintendo needs to take a look back and realize how it reached the top of its game. I can guarantee that it did not reach the highest heights of success by resting on its past. Nintendo reached the top by embracing new ideas and searching out new concepts. 

<p>Thats the Nintendo Id like to see.
