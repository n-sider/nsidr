"The game itself can indeed be engaging and challenging if you're willing to spend a couple of hours getting your bearings and can look past some serious problems. Since there's a well-thought-out game design underneath the interface, it's certainly possible to get into Mage Knight DS and spend some good, quality time thinking about the best army to bring into each battle and balancing the various trade-offs and risks of doing battle. But unless you're patient, forgiving, and looking for a complicated strategy game, you'd best stay away from this one."</div><br />

"Mage Knight Destinys Soldier for the Nintendo DS nearly flawlessly takes the engine made popular by its WizKids board game brother and integrates a solid RPG esque storyline. The game boasts intense strategy with a shade of luck and a cast of known fantasy characters (all of which can be acquired for your team during your campaign). Mage Knight is poised to be a major sleeper hit that should appeal to fans of Gladius, Mage Knight (Board game) or the smash hit Hero Clix."</div><br />
