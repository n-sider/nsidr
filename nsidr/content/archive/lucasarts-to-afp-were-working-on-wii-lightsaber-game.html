Making the rounds this weekend is a very, very tiny mention in an otherwise non-noteworthy <a href="http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/companies/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&lvl2=comp&ArticleID=1518-1783_2119756">mainstream press report</a> about Wii that will probably be responsible for millions of Star Wars fan voices crying out in joy&mdash;LucasArts has apparently let slip that they are, in fact, working on a Wii lightsaber game.<br />
<br />
The mention was made to Agence France-Presse, and is summarized thusly: "The head of the LucasArts, the game division for "Star Wars" series creator George Lucas, told AFP a Wii game that lets players wield virtual light sabers is on the horizon."<br />
<br />
Is this a brand-new game?  Or might they simply be talking about a feature of the Wii version of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2795">already-announced</a> LEGO Star Wars game?  Time will tell.
