Majesco Entertainment has figured out its path to profitability: after a Q1 2006 in which it took $2.1 million in losses, it's narrowed its loss to $182,000 in Q1 2007.<br />
<br />
Sales are down too, but the ratio has improved dramatically.  The $2.1 million loss was on $21.6 million in sales, amounting to a 9.7% loss.  This year's $182,000 was on $14.5 million in sales but only meant a 1.3% loss.<br />
<br />
What's changed at Majesco is its focus.  Mass-market games now make up 99% of its revenue, compared to 18% last year.  And Majesco's interim CEO Jesse Sutton's <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6167681.html">plan going forward</a> is simple: mass-market, and Nintendo.<br />
<br />
""Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the successes of both the Nintendo DS and Wii systems as their installed bases continue to grow," Sutton explained, "and we will focus the majority of our game development efforts on these platforms."
