<p>Nintendo Europe has announced today that it will be offering its customers a bundle featuring a Nintendo DS system and the Mario Kart DS game.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1396">the bundle releasing in North America</a>, which includes the ber-elite "racing red" DS, decals, and a special wrist strap, the European bundle comes with a standard-issue silver-colored Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>The bundle will release on November 25, 2005, the same day the game itself releases.  The bundle will be available for GBP 100.00, or Euro 150.00.</p>
