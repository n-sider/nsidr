<i>Super Mario Galaxy 2</i> is just sixteen scant days away.  Hard to imagine, isn't it?  Like I'm sure many other Mario fans are doing, I'm playing the original <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> again.  <i>Galaxy</i> was not just another 3D Mario; it did a number of really cool things that set it apart&mdash;things that made me an instant rabid fan of <i>Galaxy 2</i> from the moment it was announced.  And so, to ring in <i>Galaxy 2</i>'s imminent release, I thought I'd share five of my favorite things about its groundbreaking predecessor&mdash;#2 went up <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/five-awesome-things-about-super-mario-galaxy-2">last week</a>&mdash;while we wait for it to hit shelves and fall in love all over again.<br />

<span class="dropcap">3</span> <b>Powerups</b> For the purposes of this post, I'm going to ignore the Fire Flower.  Let's face it: its weird shake-to-fire thing wasn't so great.  But Galaxy's <i>other</i> powerups were pretty fantastic, with two in particular standing out.  My favorite from my first time through <i>Galaxy</i> was Spring Mario, particularly in his primary home turf of Toy Time Galaxy.  Though moving around on ground level through tiny bounces could be challenging, unleashing a giant leap by holding down the A button as if coiling Mario up was an unparalleled feeling, particularly as I watched the ground drop violently away from beneath my feet.  Automatically turbo wall-jumping was also a nice touch.<br />
<br />
As I came back to the game, though, I think I have to give the most props to the Ice Flower.  Though Mario could, of course, ice-skate without it&mdash;given ice&mdash;Ice Mario could make his <i>own</i> ice while the powerup lasted.  This provided for some neat opportunities: in the "wow" category, ice-skating on lava; and in the "that's a neat idea" group, leading a Cataquack across a fragile bridge so he could rocket you up to the Power Star.  But let's not forget its most genius moment: wall-jumping up <i>waterfalls</i>.  I still smile thinking about it.<br />
<br />
<i>Super Mario Galaxy 2</i> is looking to be no slouch in these departments, either.  You'd have to be living under a rock or have your head stuck in the clouds to not have heard of the announced two, others are confirmed to be reappearing from the original, and who knows&mdash;there may just be some more they haven't talked about yet.  Considering how much fun I had with the powerups from the first, I'm expecting great things from <i>2</i>'s selection.  Just over two weeks to go...
