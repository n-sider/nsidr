<p>IGN has received word from sources close to Namco that <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/681/681288p1.html">Nintendo of America will publish</a> the sequel to the card-battling RPG <i>Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean</i> in the US later this year.</p>

<p>Unlike its predecessor, <i>Baten Kaitos 2</i> is not being published by Namco in Japan either, but being published by Nintendo in that territory as well.  Nintendo seems to be publishing several exclusive titles as of late, from <i>Meteos</i> last year to Namco's <i>Tales of Phantasia</i> this year; perhaps feeling they can better support their own systems by such actions.</p>
