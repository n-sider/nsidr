<p>THQ President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Farrell spoke at the UBS' 32nd Annual Media Week Conference in New York, according to Nintendojo.com.  During a Q&A session, Farrell addressed several topics relating to Nintendo.</p>

<p>When asked about THQ's view of the new handheld systems, Farrell said, "We see the PSP as sort of 16 and above  Were putting our older-gamer franchises  like MX, like WWE, some of the more core-gamer franchises  on PSP. DS we see as sort of 16 and below, so while we will put some of our slightly older titles on the DS, things like SpongeBob, The Incredibles, all of our key mass-market titles you will see on DS and GBA. So, we see Sony really winning at the high end of the market, and Nintendo excelling where theyve normally excelled, which is gamers sort of 16 and under.</p>

<p>When asked about his thoughts on the timeframe for the launches of the next-gen consoles, he said, "Our bet is one system next year and then one, maybe two, in the following year. Were starting to hear a little bit more about even Nintendos next product, Revolution, which, again, our best guess now is 06."</p>
