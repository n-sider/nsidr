<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-12-japan_lite.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Via Weekly Famitsu and <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8879">Gamasutra's report</a> comes the Japanese gaming industry's fiscal-year-end report for 2005 (ending in March 2006), and the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> stole the show selling 4.32 million hardware units.</p>

<p>It wasn't enough for the DS to simply take the top hardware spot (and not entirely unexpected for a popular console yet in the beginnings of its life) &mdash; Nintendo DS titles also took four of the top five software spots as well.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><cite>Animal Crossing: Wild World</cite></a> took the top slot with 2.34 million copies sold since its introduction this past November, edging out the only non-DS title in the top five, <cite>Final Fantasy XII</cite> for Sony's PlayStation 2, which sold 2.05 million copies.</p>

<p>Rounding out the top five were the two <cite>Brain Training for Adults</cite> titles (the first of which is due to be released as <cite>Brain Age</cite> next week in the States), selling 1.85 million copies for the first and 1.70 million copies for the second; followed by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><cite>Mario Kart DS</cite></a> in the fifth spot, selling 1.21 million copies.</p>
