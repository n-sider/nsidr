<h2>Street Fighter Legends - Page 11</h2>


<P><h3><B><I>I <U>LOVE</U> my Street Fighter.</i></b></h3>

<P>As we wind down the legend of Street Fighter, its impossible to ignore the importance it holds in the history of videogames, and also in Nintendos history.  At the absolute height of its extreme popularity, it could only be found in one place, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.  That alone is a big reason why Nintendo eventually won the 16-bit war.  And its no coincidence to note that by the time Street Fighters popularity waned, it wasnt available to play on a Nintendo system.

<P>Ask yourself this, were it not for Street Fighter, would fighting games ever have gotten as popular as theyd become?

<P>Would Virtua Fighter, Tekken, and more recently Soul Calibur II be so highly regarded today?

<P>You can draw your own conclusions, and many will argue that there were fighting games before Street Fighter ever reared its ugly head, but none have ever been as important in the grand scheme of things, and arguably none ever will be.

<P>Street Fighter has done so much for so many people, and for that we must be thankful that Capcom created such a wonderful videogame legend.  Kudos to Capcom, and most definitely kudos to Street Fighter.
