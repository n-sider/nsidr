<h2>Street Fighter Legends - Page 4</h2>

<P><h3><I><B>The Street Fighter star begins to fall.</i></b></h3>

<P>Then Capcom did the unthinkable.  They announced that Street Fighter II: Champion Edition would be arriving on a 16-bit console, but that console was to be the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and not the Super Nintendo as many were expecting.  This came as a complete and utter shock to all Nintendo fans, because up until now Capcom had pretty much been an exclusive 3rd party developer for Nintendo systems.  We werent impressed!

<P>I can confidently say that, in my opinion, this was the point where Street Fighters star began its descent from its lofty position in the videogame pantheon sky.

<P>The shock didnt last very long, because shortly after that announcement, Capcom announced that while Sega owners would be receiving Champion Edition, Nintendo owners would instead be receiving the Turbo edition of Street Fighter.

<P>Nintendo fans, still reeling from the Sega announcement, gasped a massive sigh of relief as the balance had been corrected.  Nintendo would get the superior version, it didnt matter all that much that Capcom were making games for Sega.  We were getting the better version and thats all that mattered!

<P>The rumour mill suggested that Sega wasnt happy about this and lobbied with Capcom to do something about it.  Capcom obliged, and in what was a red letter year (1993) a Capcom-developed game premiered on a non-Nintendo system and Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition was released to eager Genesis/Mega Drive owners on a massive 24Mbit cart.  More importantly, SNES owners received Street Fighter II: Turbo on a 20Mbit cart.  Both versions of the game were essentially the same, each containing both SFII:CE and SFII:T, as well as selectable speed modes.  The only differences were that the Sega version had a Group Battle mode, while the SNES version didnt.  However, the SNES version boasted superior graphics while the MD/Genesis version had to make do with a 64-colour palette.  Regardless of the differences, it was Street Fighter heaven, and once again Capcom laughed all the way to the bank.
