<h2>Street Fighter Legends - Page 10</h2>


<P><h3><I><B>A True sequel belatedly arrives.</i></b></h3>

<P>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Street Fighter had reached its natural and long-awaited evolution.  Street Fighter 3 was coming, but by this time hardly anyone cared.  The Street Fighter star was fading away.

<P>When Street Fighter III arrived, Capcom had changed a lot of things.  One of the biggest changes was removing Ryu as the main character.  This role went to newcomer Alex.  Ryu, Ken, and a few others were still present though.  In hindsight, players were disappointed.  Many staples in their fighting styles were gone, there were no mid-air moves and no mid-air blocks.  The parry system was too cumbersome to be used in practice.  The mini-games werent as captivating as the car or the barrels!!  And there were hardly any characters to play as.  Street Fighter III wasnt the game people were waiting for.

<P><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/sflegends-11.gif">

<P>And still Capcom persisted, releasing both Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact and later Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike.  Once again these included the usual enhancements everyone expected such as more characters, game modes, special moves, and hidden secretes.  And predictably the console conversions on Dreamcast were released to an increasingly declining fanbase.

<P>Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike represents the last proper Street Fighter game to be released to date, and the Street Fighter star has never shone as bright as it did in the heady days of Street Fighter II: The World Warriors.

<P>Today, the Street Fighter star still defiantly shines ever so slightly at "home" on a Nintendo system, with editions on the Game Boy Advance.
