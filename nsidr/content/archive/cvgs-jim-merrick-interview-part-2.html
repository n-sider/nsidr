<p><a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php(que)id=126763">Part two of CVG's Jim Merrick interview</a> is online.  Some noteworthy excerpts:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>We've seen some massively unconventional DS titles like Electroplankton and the Brain Training games make a big splash over in Japan. What are the chances of these kind of non-game games finding a market over in Europe?</b></p>

<p><b>Jim Merrick:</b> Yes, we're definitely going to bring Electroplankton over - I hesitate to call it a game, I'm not sure what it is - but it is fascinating. It's a time sponge - you turned the system on and I've spend an hour fooling around with little plankton. We'll definitely bring that over because it shows the capabilities of the system and it has the ability to captivate people who would not normally look at a game. Do I think it has potential as a huge commercial success, no. Something like the brain training games also, we'll absolutely bring over. They're doing so well in Japan and they do show a very strong appeal to an older demographic and also to a more female demographic which is part of our objective in expanding the marketplace.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Compared to something like the GameCube, the Revolution's design is pretty sophisticated. Do you think something as straightforward as the console's aesthetic appeal is going to help broaden the Nintendo brand?</b></p>

<p><b>Jim Merrick:</b> Yeah, I think so. I mean there's four colours that we're showing right now - and none of them are purple. There are things in design that help us to associate and this is not a lunchbox - you have an elegant, simple design that should be a bit more timeless and ageless. Anyone of any age should be proud to say "This is my Revolution".</p></blockquote>
