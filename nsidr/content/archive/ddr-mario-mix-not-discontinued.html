<p>Rumors have been swirling as of late that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=989"><i>Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</i></a> has been discontinued due to problems with the dance pad.  This has caused no small amount of confusion to owners of the game whose pads are working perfectly.</p>

<p>To try to clear the air. Kotaku contacted Nintendo of America and <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-dance-dance-not-discontinued-140409.php">got a statement</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Were very pleased with the success of Mario DDR. In fact, there has been such high demand, it has driven out-of-stock situations at retail. Were currently reviewing our plans to bring in more product in 2006.</p></blockquote>

<p>If this reporter had to guess, Nintendo just really didn't expect the title to do as well as it has been doing.  Here's hoping they can get it back on shelves quickly, because at one point, it <em>was</em> on my Christmas list.</p>
