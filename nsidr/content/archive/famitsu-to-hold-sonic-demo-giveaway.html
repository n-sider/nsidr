In this reporter's ongoing series on "why Japan is better than the U.S.", I'm presenting one key piece of evidence: Famitsu's <i>Sonic and the Secret Rings</i> <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2007/01/31/103,1170238285,66432,0,0.html">sweepstakes</a>, where the lucky winner gets a "trial version" of the game.<br />
<br />
The title contains eight levels from the full game, including Sand Oasis, Dinosaur Jungle, Evil Foundry, and four selections constituting a Lost Prologue, which appears to contain a tutorial section for the game.  (Yes, we're aware that's seven, but that's what Famitsu says.) The demo will feature 20 of the full version's 100 equippable skills.<br />
<br />
The deadline for entry is February 23, which I suppose shoots a hole in the hole "Japan is better" theory: we actually get the full game on February 20.  Winners will be getting the trials in early march, but Japan will have to wait until March 15 for the full game to be available in stores.
