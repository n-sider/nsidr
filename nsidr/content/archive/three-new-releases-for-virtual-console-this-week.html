  <li><i>Wonder Boy in Monster World</i> (Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Battle Lode Runner</i> (TurboGrafx 16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
All three titles will go up at 9 a.m. Pacific Time, at which point Wii owners with a broadband Internet connection can purchase them with Wii Points in the Wii Shop Channel.  Wii Points are currently available at a rate of about 100 Points for US$1.
