<p>Investors are reacting very positively to E3 news that Nintendo plans to bring Wii to stores this Christmas, as well as the general media reaction to the console, according to BBC News.</p>

<p>Nintendo shares <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4772109.stm">went up 6.2%</a> after the show, hitting a high of 19,980 yen, their highest value since April 2002.  BBC News technology editor Alfred Hermida credits Wii's overshadowing of Sony's PlayStation 3 at the show with the stock boost.</p>
