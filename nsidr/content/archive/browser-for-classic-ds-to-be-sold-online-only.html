The Opera-based <i>Nintendo DS Browser</i>, available for some time now in Japan and Europe, is finally headed to North America&mdash;but owners of the classic Nintendo DS hardware will have to buy it online if they want it to work with their system.<br />
<br />
The browser software requires a RAM expansion pack to operate, which fits into slot 2 on the DS.  (Slot 2 also accepts Game Boy Advance games and the Rumble Pak.)  Nintendo is, as they have done in other territories, making two variations of the expansion pack: one that only fits the Nintendo DS Lite; and one that fits both models, but juts out of the Lite about a centimeter in the same fashion as GBA games.  For the North American release, the Lite version <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6170135.html">will be most prevalent</a>; Nintendo has said they will only sell the classic version through online outlets, including their own online store.<br />
<br />
The Nintendo DS Browser will be available June 4.
