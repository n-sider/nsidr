Guardian Unlimited recently had the opportunity to speak with game developer Will Wright, creator of <i>Sim City</i> and <i>The Sims</i>. Below are a few choice quotes.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>When asked about the general attitude toward video games, Wright said, "In some sense I think the cultural acceptance of games is inevitable just because people are going to have grown up having this technology."</li>
  <li>He wasn't always creating god-games! "My first game was a shoot 'em up, but when I designed it I found that creating the world I was going to blow up was more interesting than blowing it up — that's where I came to Sim City."</li>
  <li>Wright loves the DS and Wii! "The only next gen system I've seen is the Wii — the PS3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last, but pretty much the same game with incremental improvements."</li>
  <li>Finally, Wright confirmed at last that <i>Spore</i> is coming to Wii. No details were revealed other than its existence. For the uninformed, Spore is a game where players create their own species, beginning with a single-celled organism, and eventually move on to conquer space.</li>
