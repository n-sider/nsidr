<p>Juniper Research has issued a press release stating that the next generation of home consoles will reach even a larger audience than the current generation. According to the study, the next generation of systems will include much more "Internet gaming, wireless connectivity between machines and handhelds, as well as other new entertainment functions." The study claims that consoles will become more like home media centers (again stressing connectivity between devices) and finally bring console gaming to the entertainment mainstream.

<p>On the numerical side of things, the group predicts that the number of regular online gamers, worldwide, will reach nearly 28 billion by 2008. The group also forecasts that handheld gaming revenue will reach a hefty $25 billion by 2008, as Nintendo faces new competitors like Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP). Total Next-Generation Console sales are estimated to reach $35 billion in the same time period.
