Nintendo Power says (3.5/10),<br>
"I know it's for kids, but that doesn't excuse the fact that Backyard Baseball 2007 just isn't very good.  The gameplay is too slow and watered-down to offer anything resembling a baseball sim, and it doesn't go far enough with its over-the-top antics to put it in the wacky arcade territory.  It's just kind of stuck in the boring middle."
