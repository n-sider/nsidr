<p>According to Nintendojo, Electronic Arts mentioned the number of titles it intends on releasing for the Nintendo DS for its fiscal year beginning April 2005 and ending March 2006.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">"We havent finalized our SKU plan for FY06, but I would imagine that youll see us publish something in the neighborhood of 8 to 12 titles for the Dual Screen, 15 to 20 on the PlayStation Portable... We would certainly expect to have the kind of market share on the PlayStation Portable as we have enjoyed on the PlayStation 2 and, I think, a larger market share on the Dual Screen than we have had on the Game Boy Advance."</font></p>

<p>Electronic Arts has already said it will release <i>Madden NFL 2005</i>, <i>Tiger Woods PGA</i>, and <i>The Urbz: Sims in the City</i> alongside the DS's launch this November.  Titles such as <i>GoldenEye: Rogue Agent</i> and <i>Need For Speed Underground</i> will come in the months following launch.</p>
