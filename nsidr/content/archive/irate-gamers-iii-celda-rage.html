Okay, lets start this thing off right.<br />
<br />
I hate you all.<br />
<br />
Hmm, that came off a bit harsh.  I suppose I don't hate you ALL.  The vast majority may be a bit more accurate.  Either way, Ive got a lot of pent up rage, and you get to hear about it.  After all, you're the ones to blame for it.<br />
<br />
But lets be a bit more specific for now.  Theres one particular debate thats been driven so far into the ground that I thought it would never again see the light of day.  But thanks to a few new blurry screens, the dreaded Celda argument has again reared its ugly head.  I thought I had heard enough ridiculous accusations and moronic streams of logic to desensitize myself at this point, but for some reason the new insurgence has again cut me to the core.  And this time I'm not about to let it stand.<br />
<br />
Lets see what we've got here. <br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">The new Zelda looks kiddy!  It sucks!</div><br />
Here we have the most generalized argument against the game, if you can even call it an argument.  The wild accusation that toon shading results in a graphical style only acceptable for little babies, puppies, and magical nymphs is so outrageously laughable that I have to muzzle myself in order to keep from tearing someones head off with my teeth. <br />
<br />
Perhaps an individual with a smidgen of intelligence could look back and notice how the vibrant and colorful Mario 64 remains to this day one of the most entertaining games of all time.  I'm sorry, but if an abundance of color equates immaturity, Id better be able to find you people living in houses of black, gray, and brown.  Only an infant would dare enjoy a color palate that doesn't look like a puddle of mud, right? <br />
<br />
I'll concede your point if Link comes out and fights Ganon with a giant pacifier in his mouth and a pink bow on his head.  But if his only offense is being colorful and, dare I say it, cartoony, then you all have nothing.  It all comes down to the simple illusion of your own maturity.  A person doesn't grow out of color, and suddenly require blood and cursing to make it through the day.  Zelda, and Mario for that matter, exists in an atmosphere that can appeal to all age groups.  I'm 19 years old as of this writing, and I own and enjoyed Banjo Kazooie/Tooie, Pokemon Snap, Yoshi's Story, and a plethora of other such kiddy games.  Good lord, whats the matter with me?  Could it be that my tastes transcend the societal norms and I exist as a beacon of independence in an otherwise conformist world?  Or are you all just close-minded insecure dolts? <br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-287-1.jpg" width="200" height="120" class="image_nostyle" /></div>Regardless, this is assuming that Nintendo opts to make Zelda overwhelmingly bright and sunny.  However, that doesn't seem like it will be the case.  There are shots of moody dungeons, ominous thunder storms, and spooky caves.  All locations that the toon shading technique is quite capable of representing.  I don't know why people think you cant have a dark atmosphere just because they're using more flat colors and an avant garde art style. <br />
<br />
But most people don't really rip apart the style point for point when trying to say it looks immature and terrible.  They compare it to the N64 games, which have a notably darker and more realistic presentation.  However, does that somehow mean the new Zelda will be crap?  Lets see here... <br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">The new Zelda doesnt look like Ocarina of Time!  It sucks!</div><br />
Hey, I like that logic!  Lets use it some more! <br />
<br />
Link to the Past doesn't look like Ocarina of Time!  It sucks! <br />
<br />
Oh, wait. <br />
<br />
If you really sit down and think about it, the N64 Zelda games were the result of an incorrect transition to 3D.  The Zelda games on previous consoles had never attempted to create a realistic atmosphere.  Link to the Past and Links Awakening had sufficiently stylized trees and architecture, cartoonish enemies, and a very bright color palette (once Zelda DX came along, at least).  They could've gone the route of, say, Final Fantasy III (VI in Japan), but they remained light-hearted as a specific design choice.  The games were still epic and fantastically entertaining, they just weren't trying to look real. <br />
<br />
However, that all changed when Ocarina of Time came along.  The game maintained its sense of epic adventure and kept all the gameplay that made the Zelda series great, but the developers went all out and created a world that was in stark contrast to the older legends.  It was beautiful, true.  But it wasn't the same.  And Miyamoto later expressed regret as to where the series ended up from a design standpoint.  He wasn't thrilled with the new Link.  The earring-wearing badass gallivanting around in a realistic world.  So he went back to the series roots. <br />
<br />
The new Zelda, at least when it comes to appearance, is the true sequel to the SNES and Game Boy games.  It returns to the stylized and colorful world of days long past.  However, people cant seem to let go of the world that the N64 games created.  It was a nice world.  That much is certain.  But it wasn't the RIGHT world. <br />
<br />
Good attitude: The old Zelda games were great!  While the N64 ones were also fantastic, I cant wait to see how the series would look in 3D while maintaining the art stylings from the originals.  Its the best of both worlds! <br />
<br />
Bad attitude: I want more Ocarina of Time, dammit!  The new Link looks like a little girl!  If a game isn't dark and realistic, I don't want anything to do with it!  Cel shading ruins the series! <br />
<br />
How can it ruin the series if thats the way the series was FROM THE VERY BEGINNING?  Its a damn shame how many people fall into the second group of opinions there.  In the grand scheme, though, you have to ask yourself a question. <br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Why do I play video games?</div><br />
Do you play mature looking games so you can look cool in front of your friends?  Can you not bear to play anything that might be considered immature because you're afraid of what people might think?  Have you been so warped by pop culture that you honestly cant find enjoyment in the brightest and happiest forms of entertainment? <br />
<br />
None of you will admit to anything in the last paragraph.  It would go against the very image you're attempting to uphold.  But perhaps if you took a good long look at what you're doing in the first place, you'd realize the situation you're in. <br />
<br />
Why should you play video games? <br />
<br />
Because they're fun. <br />
<br />
Nothing else is a valid reason.  The appearance of a game only factors into why you might like looking at it.  If you cant actually enjoy PLAYING it, however, all the realistic graphics in the world wont help you. <br />
<br />
And luckily, thats what the Zelda games are renowned for.  Being fun to play.  Being masterpieces of entertainment.  Being the reason you go out and buy a system.  So you can run around in Hyrule field in your epic quest to defeat the prince of darkness. <br />
<br />
Now sit down and wait for E3, punks.
