Nintendo Australia recently revealed (via Australian IT) that global Wii shortages will continue to have an impact on the local market during this Christmas season.<br />
<br />
Managing Director Rose Lappin pointed out that Nintendo will be shipping an additional 20,000 consoles to Australia next week (in addition to the 20,000 presently on store shelves).<br />
<br />
The situation is unlikely to change until at least early next year, after all subsidiaries meet to discuss 2008 production.<br />
<br />
Ms. Lappin assured consumers that Australia will receive another stock shipment in January, followed by regular deliveries after that.<br />
<br />
Of the current stock situation, Ms. Lappin said: "I see it as very positive - the Wii is still selling as strongly as it is a year after it launched."
