Studio Renegade Kid, makers of Gamecock-published recent release <i>Dementium: The Ward</i>, has signed with publisher Mastiff to deliver their next DS title, code-named <i>Project M</i>.<br />
<br />
Details on the next title are <i>extremely</i> light, with Mastiff simply noting the next title is buzzword-compliant with "high-quality 3-D visuals,  intuitive controls, real-time lighting, and dynamic audio".  Apart from this, Mastiff's Bill Swartz noted Renegade "has proven the DS is not just a platform for kiddie games," which may or may not be a clue.<br />
<br />
Mastiff's publishing record includes <i>Gurumin</i> for PSP, <i>Dr Sudoku</i> for GBA, <i>Pump It Up: Exceed</i> and <i>La Pucelle: Tactics</i>.  Both companies are, as is expected, happy with the arrangement.
