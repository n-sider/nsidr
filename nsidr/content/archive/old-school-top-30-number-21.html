<i>We're counting down to the Wii's launch with a daily look at what retro games we'd like to see on the Virtual Console.  Each also features a Virtual Console Likelihood rating.  A rating of 5 means the game has officially been announced for the service.  Click <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/30-days-of-old-school-top-30">here</a> for an archive of previous days, or keep on reading below!</i><br />

While very few copies were made of Ogre Battle for the SNES, Enix re-released it for the Playstation and Saturn later to much more success.  The Saturn version, released in 1996, included cut scenes and voice acting, so here's hoping if Virtual Console gets a version, it will be the Saturn one.  Still, there's something to be said for no load times, so either way I'd be happy.<br />
<br />
Ogre Battle is now a multi-part series, and I'd also like the N64 chapter, "Person of Lordly Caliber" to unofficially share this spot on the countdown.  It's a strategy game, and while the "Tactics Ogre" spinoff series is a tactical RPG like Advance Wars or Final Fantasy Tactics, the closest thing to be released similar to Ogre Battle is the Soul Calibur 3 "Chronicles of the Sword" strategy mode.  All the action is controlled on an overhead map of the land.  If one of your characters (representing a small army unit) touches an enemy, they have a battle which is not controlled by the player in a direct sense, but the strategy of the whole unit can be chosen and the stats do all the work.  By visiting and freeing towns from your enemies, new characters can be added to your army, and items can be found.<br />

One of the unique things about it is that at the beginning of the game, a seer named Warren reads your fortune using tarot cards and the answers to questions designed to uncover your personality.  The answers you give will start your primary character's alignment as  either righteous, evil, or neutral.  Alignment also affects your whole army in the form of "reputation".  Depending on your alignments, charisma, and reputation, one of twelve endings will be found.  There is also an incredible amount of customization available to you for building the army of your choice.  Over 75 different classes are available to your units, depending on the choices you make in playing the game.  There are also non-humanoid units galore and 18 unique characters that may or may not join you and may or may not have a great impact on the game's story, again depending on how you play the game.  <br />
<br />
If you like tactical strategy games, like Fire Emblem, FF: Tactics, or Advance Wars, this series is a must-play.  If you're new to the genre, or aren't sure about this series, find a way to play the SNES original, as it's the best way to learn the ropes and dive into the really good plot.<br />

<div class="align_center"><b>#24 (Nintendo)</b> - <i>1080 Snowboarding</i><br />

One of the first, and one of the best games that started the extreme sports genre of gaming, 1080 Snowboarding is a downhill racer that includes the ability to perform cool tricks along the way.  Think Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam or SSX.  This was the game to which those others owe their existence.  It was very successful on the N64, and for good reason.  The soundtrack, the graphics, and the course design are really top notch as far as N64 games go, and the tricks are easy to learn and hard to master, all while being extremely fun.<br />

Races are all one-on-one from the top of the course to the finish line at the bottom.  Many shortcuts are available and as I mentioned before the track design is really impressive.  Multiplayer is great, although only two players can compete at a time.  Just like Wave Race before it, the number of racers and tracks is reduced in order to make each one unique and as close to perfection as possible.  There are five racers, and three unlockable secret racers, and there are six courses.  Time Attack, Trick Attack, Match Race, Contest Mode, and Practice Mode are the ways of playing, and they really increase the replayability of the game.  Like all games in this countdown, it's highly recommended by your's truly.
