Last Friday, Nintendo of America conducted a Wi-Fi Connection beta test for the game.  NOA's Andy recalls the night saying he had a great experience and looks forward to the game's public release on March 20.  Andy notes, "The first thing I noticed is that the lobby system in Hunters is great. Unlike Mario Kart DS, you can choose when to stop looking for opponents and start the action."<br><br>
