<p>The latest issue of Famitsu contains several interviews with individuals from Japanese game developers.  <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/06/15/news_6127604.html">Gamespot</a> has translated their thoughts on the next-generation consoles.</p>

<p><b>Yuji Naka, Sonic the Hedgehog series creator at Sega</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>PlayStation 3</b> - "I am very interested in its high-quality graphics capabilities. It's equipped with a graphics chip that's twice as powerful as the high-end [graphics card] for the PC, which allows it to make realistic expressions that haven't been possible before."
<li><b>Revolution</b> - "I look forward to the 'new kind of fun' that's unique to Nintendo, and I expect that there will be a lot of surprises, such as the unannounced controller. It's also great that we'll be able to play Famicom and other games via download. I hope Sega games will be playable as well." [Note: A number of Sega games have been released for Nintendo consoles by Sunsoft.]
<li><b>Xbox 360</b> - "[Microsoft has] used its knowledge from Xbox Live to evolve their network, making its services and controls even more convenient for the user, which I think is a very attractive point."
  </ul></p>

<p><b>Keisuke Kikuchi, Kagero II and Fatal Frame series producer at Tecmo</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>PlayStation 3</b> - "It has a very attractive, high machine spec. It may be difficult to design a system that can balance out the use of its power, but it should be worth the effort. It should be fun to make games that tend to require high-quality graphics, such as horse-racing games and horror games."
<li><b>Revolution</b> - "It's difficult to comment on it, since there's been very little information, but I'm looking forward to the controller that's yet to be announced."
<li><b>Xbox 360</b> - "It's a well-balanced machine. Its CPU, graphics, memory, network capability, and convenience of hardware control are at a high level. I would like to make a game that takes advantage of its online connection."
  </ul></p>

<p><b>Masanori Takeuchi, Otogi series producer at From Software</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>PlayStation 3</b> - "To be honest, it's still full of unknown factors, and it's difficult to comment on. In my own opinion, it doesn't seem like hardware that will make games more fun. It's being called a 'supercomputer,' so I guess it's like a set-top box which functions like a PC. My impression [of the console] is like, 'It can also play games,' which is good."
<li><b>Revolution</b> - "It's like a console that old-time gamers can drool over. It still has some mysteries, but it's not too difficult to imagine what the machine can do, so there should be people that are clearly looking forward to purchasing it. Its capabilities, such as the function to play with the DS via Wi-Fi connection, might change the way of gaming, and it's interesting."
<li><b>Xbox 360</b> - "It seems like a standard evolvement from the current generation [of consoles]. Whether that's good or bad would depend on the opinion of different people. But it's obvious that the console is meant for heavy users. I believe it's also a console that publishers can use their accumulated knowledge the most [out of the next-generation machines]. It's the best hardware if you have a good fund and you don't want to take risks in development."
  </ul></p>

<p><b>Noritaka Funamizu, former Capcom producer and current executive director of Craft & Meister</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>PlayStation 3</b> - "It's hardware with the utmost power. I believe it can realize new expressions, in both graphics and music, in ways that haven't been possible until now."
<li><b>Revolution</b> - "There hasn't been much information released about it yet. But I'm looking forward to it as a machine that will feature a distinct kind of fun, different from the direction that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are headed."
<li><b>Xbox 360</b> - "It has a high [hardware] capability, but it's also strong in terms of network, and it's also a major console in the American market. So I am planning on title[s] with those aspects kept in consideration."
  </ul></p>

<p><b>Kou Shibusawa, producer at Koei</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>PlayStation 3</b> - "We showed a trailer of Ni-oh at E3 in May. This game will take full advantage of the extreme hardware spec of the PlayStation 3. Being able to show movie-quality CG in real time raises our creativeness, and it stimulates our heart as creators. We hope our challenge on new product[s] that will stun our users."
<li><b>Revolution</b> - "It seems to be going in a different direction from the other two consoles, and it's trying to develop its own unique market. Being able to play old games from the Famicom era should be enticing to the gaming generation, and as a creator, I look forward to playing my games that I have a special fondness for. Aside from having good graphics, the Revolution's uniqueness and concentration towards gameplay should make it a product that's good towards all ages."
<li><b>Xbox 360</b> - "Aside from the machine specs, I see great potential in its network capabilities and connectivity with PCs, which is Microsoft's territory. When thinking about the future of online games, I feel the urge to create a new product that takes advantage of [Xbox Live]. Since the Xbox 360 is coming out first, I am very interested in looking at how it will affect the market."
