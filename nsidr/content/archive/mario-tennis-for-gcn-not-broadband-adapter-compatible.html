<p>Mario Tennis for the Nintendo GameCube will not feature LAN nor online play, according to Nintendo.  This is in response to the game being listed as "Broadband Adapter compatible" on both the European and North American official Nintendo websites.  Instead, Nintendo says, the listing was the result of a database error and the game will only contain connectivity with the Game Boy Advance.</p>
