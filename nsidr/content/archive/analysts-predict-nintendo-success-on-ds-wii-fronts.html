Analysts are bullish on Nintendo's success from here on out, it seems, given bits of their latest reports issued recently.<br />
<br />
First off, from DFC Intelligence's David Cole, we have <a href="http://www.dfcint.com/game_article/feb07article.html">a few words</a> as to how Nintendo manages to completely own the handheld space with DS&mdash;with the software it releases for the platform.  "What makes [recent successful DS] titles standout from similar versions for previous portable platforms is the touch screen interface," Cole explains.  "A user can still control the system using the traditional button pushing, but now there is the option of using a stylus and touch screen.  This control scheme works great for more low key products and those intimated by button mashing.<br />
<br />
"Most importantly, Nintendo has put real thought and money into its development and marketing.  The company doesn't simply port its franchises onto mobile platforms, but instead either completely rethinks its key franchises or creates new IP... Sure throwing well-known IP onto a portable system can make a quick buck, but it is a far cry from what Nintendo does.  Consumers have clearly rewarded Nintendo for its extra effort."<br />

IDC has also <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=205659">thrown its support</a> behind Nintendo's strategy with Wii.  "Nintendo... is the only one of the three manufacturers working to grow its total accessible market for its hardware and software by broadening its audience beyond the traditional market," the IDC release says.  "Nintendo has designed its latest hardware and software to be more inviting and fun, and less intimidating for non-gamers including those who may never self-identify as a gamer. Nintendo also enjoys support from the fan base it has captured with successful first party franchises. IDC believes hardware shipments of Nintendo's Wii will capture a little more than a third of the worldwide market by 2008, rising slightly above Sony's PS3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360."
