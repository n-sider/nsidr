<p><i>Paper Mario</i> is now available for the iQue in China, according to Nintendo subsidiary iQue Ltd.  This is the same <i>Paper Mario</i> released for the Nintendo 64, however it has been translated to the Chinese language.</p>

<p>Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance with games <i>Super Mario Advance</i> and <i>Wario Land 4</i> in China earlier this week under the iQue brand.  It appears Nintendo is slowly but surely working its way into the market.</p>
