Related to the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2742">relocation going on at Nintendo of America</a> is the news that three of the company's most famous execs are on their way out the door, according to sources of <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/DBDBAA74-D8AD-4175-8286-3E54EB0494F1.htm">Game informer</a> and <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/794/794650p1.html">IGN</a>.<br />
<br />
Both sources say that VP of marketing and corporate affairs Perrin Kaplan, senior director of PR Beth Llewelyn, and senior VP of marketing and corporate affairs George Harrison are to leave the company in the near future.  Kaplan and Harrison in particular have often served as the public face of the company.<br />

Game Informer is saying that NOA's sales staff will take a huge hit, with 90% of the staff electing not to stay with the company given the reolcation of said staff to twin offices in New York and San Francisco.
