<p><i>Three</i> minds...one column. <i>Three</i> motives...one goal. <i>Three</i> editors...one conversation. You have now entered a dimension unlike any other. This is <b>N-Banter</b>.

<p>In our first three-person edition, Cory, James, and I look back at E3 2005 and discuss the ups and downs. Topics of discussion include the Game Boy Micro, Nintendo DS, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i>, <i>Pokmon XD</i>, <i>Animal Crossing DS</i>, and more.

<p><hr>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Let the three-way begin!

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>You guys have had some time to take things in...to absorb all the news (about a month now). What are your general thoughts about the pre-E3 conference, now that it's behind us?

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Well initially I thought it was tremendously lame. Probably because I was spoiled by E3 2004. I didn't start to get excited about anything Nintendo was showing off until I started to over-think the game downloading service. Hell, now I'm at the point where I'd buy the Revolution even if it didn't play any new games.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Like-wise. I was initially very disappointed. Solely because I wanted Nintendo to come out with all cylinders firing. Ive come to terms with it now and I can understand why they didnt.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I felt somewhat let down, but generally I was relatively satisfied with the show. Now that some time has passed, I actually feel that they did the right thing.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I don't know if I'm as happy as you James, but I'm pretty excited. I hope that Nintendo comes out very organized (ala Xbox Live 2.0) on the Online Front.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I agree about the downloading service, too. I think that's really a hole in one.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>First party games may be free to download, too, which sounds insane, but who knows.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Maybe, but I doubt it. They might have an assortment of NES games for free, like the games they offered free in <i>Animal Crossing</i> or something. But all the big games will cost you. The NES classic series has taught us that

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, Nintendo hasn't decided about pricing yet. They seem to suggest that their own stuff might be free, third party stuff may not be. But who knows where they'll go with that. I just hope it isn't expensive.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Nintendo is a business. It costs money to host all those games. I just don't see them giving away a ton of games.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Of course. That's true, but it also costs them money for online play servers, yet that's free. If it's all pay-only though, I just hope that they keep the prices reasonable. Price is the thing that could keep it niche, versus having a lot of people using it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Perhaps theyll give away games as gifts for purchasing say Mario Revolution or something, but not just for free out of nowhere. Maybe it will be a system where people get like 10 free credits for buying a revolution and more for each game they buy.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, like Mario Club in Japan. I think that would be an interesting idea actually.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah. I honestly think it's a great idea. It keeps people buying new games and also very interested in games of the past. If you have say 3 credits to download free games and you already have a bunch of the major older games, perhaps you will choose to download a lesser known game.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Yeah. There are a lot of great business models Nintendo could run with for the service.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Whichever way they go, there's no doubt that it adds a lot of appeal for Revolution.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Indeed.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I know plenty of people who haven't played many games since the SNES days, so Revolution has that kind of appeal.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Hah, it could actually lead to original games being developed for SNES or NES. Though I doubt it. But if the market was there...who knows. Nintendo does like to cash in on easy to develop games.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Another thing is, it may make previously unreleased games a reality. For example, games that didn't come to Australia or America (or Japan). Those markets may possibly have access to certain games via this system.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b><i>Doshin</i>!

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Yeah. I'd love to see <i>Sin & Punishment</i> on there. Or perhaps <i>unfinished</i> games. <i>Star Fox 2</i> comes to mind. 

<p align=center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/n-banter_06-20-2005_sin&punishment.jpg"></p>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b><i>Star Fox 64</I> is <i>Star Fox 2</i>.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>If you can get <i>Sin & Punishment</i> on download, why wouldn't you buy a Revolution? Especially if you can also get some other niche games that weren't worldwide releases.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>That game did look pretty cool.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b><i>Sin & Punishment</i> was one of the best damn games on the N64.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>One of my mailbag questions was whether the Genesis might be emulated

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>That's an interesting idea, it would be nice. Haha. It's not like Sega would have anything against that in particular, in the sense that they aren't pushing hardware anymore. But it may affect the pricing model or something.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>I heard some people talking about that too, though it's completely insane.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Perhaps, but it would be a lot of money for Sega and Nintendo might make a dollar or so off of each game downloaded too. So it might be worth it. It certainly wouldn't harm Nintendo. If anything it would only increase their appeal to classic gamers.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>But we know it'll never happen. It's the same reason sonic wasn't in SSBM.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I never thought I'd see Sonic on GameCube or GBA, but that happened.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>The whole idea is that it's a showcase of Nintendos past. Showcasing their competitors doesn't really fit into that.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It's access to the largest library of past games. Someone else could theoretically get a hold of Sega and tap into that if Nintendo doesn't, should the whole downloading concept take off.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I don't think it's particularly against Sega or Nintendo's interests, I just wonder about the financial aspect. There would be some significant licensing questions. And Sega probably do reasonably well with their constant re-makes and re-releases.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>They do well on Nintendo systems. Sonic Mega Collection sold best on GameCube. So technically with backward compatibility Sonic is already available for Revolution.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Anyway, what were your thoughts on Game Boy Micro? That seems to be another hot topic from E3.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It desperately needs an MP3 player built in, though I read they might package the Play-Yan adapter with it. That would give me an actual reason to buy it.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>I'd be more inclined to buy one if there were ANY GBA games on the horizon that I plan on buying. After <i>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</i> came out, the system became dead to me.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I think packaging Play-Yan with it would be the way to go, honestly.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It needs MP3 playability, in my book. And they need to re-release Tetris so I don't have to play the DX version (for Game Boy Color) that sticks out the bottom of my GBA.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I think, for what it is, GB Micro is a cool product. But there's no question that it's just a kind of cash-in. Hopefully it will attract some people who haven't yet picked up a GBA (but who is left?).

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>If I had an MP3 playing Game Boy my life would be solved. It will probably retail for $99.95 though.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>The SP, as an upgrade, was great because there were still new GAMES that I'd play on it. The micro is another neat upgrade, but I just can't bear to upgrade hardware that I'll never ever use. Gimme a smaller and slicker DS and we'll talk.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I've never been much of a Game Boy player, but GBA SP really did reinvigorate my interest in Game Boy. Having the light was crucial.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Cory has a point though. Nintendo itself is predicting a decline in SP sales and software, solely because it is making no new games.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah absolutely. Being able to play Game Boy games on my DS is also a big factor for me. Since I can do that, I have little reason to buy a GBM, other than sheer portability. But I guess I'm not really the one that the system is aimed at.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Unless you are 11 - 15 years old and on the go then no.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Still, it does seem pretty cool. I doubt I will buy one, but it'd be interesting to try it out in person. I am a fan of the general design.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b> It's very thin. It didnt look it when I first saw it, but its pretty sleek. I am in need of an MP3 player that isn't a 300 dollar iPod. Nintendo missed an opportunity in my book.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>There are plenty of non-GBA options for you, Jeff. ~_^

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Slight tangent here, since we're on the handheld topic. I don't understand how the GBA went this long without an original Mario platformer

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha. Yeah, that's an interesting point. 

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>I mean, the DS is getting one now, sure, but I want a standard-styled sprite-based Mario platformer.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Thats partly why I'm so excited about <I>New Super Mario Bros.</i>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>They repackaged four Mario games though. They haven't actually made an original Mario platformer in 14 years.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, I was somewhat disappointed with the first <i>Mario Advance</i>. I remember getting the system and thinking how cool it was. But playing an old game on it...it lost some excitement.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>The DS one will be great, I'm sure, but the 3D nature of it seems...odd to me. It seemsloose.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Most of these games are relatively new to kids these days. Yoshi's Island is still a title that I'm only now playing for GBA. Missed the boat back in the SNES days.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>You're right, Jeff. But that doesn't help me. Although your point is something that I think a lot of older gamers do forget. The thing that encourages me about <i>New SMB</I> is primarily that impressions so far are very positive.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I know, but we aren't the target market for the GBA. Pokmon kids are.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I disagree with that entirely. GBA has a much broader target market than, say, GameCube. You'll find that a large segment of GBAs audience is the older crowd. And females.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>I don't know about that. The GBA, as a concept, isn't embraced in public by the older crowd. No matter whether people want to play or not, they still don't necessarily want to be SEEN playing a Game Boy. Consoles, whateverit's in your own home, but handhelds are typically used in public places. At least conceptually.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>In general, Nintendo has a varied audience, but I'd say the GB brand skews young.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I don't know about the concept, but I know that GBA does well largely because it sells to a wide variety of people. I think that GBA is primarily aimed at the younger crowd, but part of its success over the years comes from its very diverse customer base. I can tell you right now - and I think many can say - they have parents or grandparents who play GB and not other home systems.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>That's the whole idea of the GB micro, according to Nintendo: that maybe people wouldn't be afraid to whip it out anymore.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, I think that is true.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I, honestly, wouldn't be as afraid if it had MP3 playback.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>But regardless of concept, I think we know that the audience is based on what Nintendo has said about the sales of the system. And probably based on our own experience too.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>To be fair to James though, GBA sold as well as PS2. It can't be only kids buying it. There are a lot of closet gaming adults that enjoy the 2D nature of the system.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>That's right. And GBA is famous for attracting a wide variety of audiences. Whether or not they are in public, a lot of adults and women are buying the system, according to sales data. The parent/grandparent example from earlier is something I think many of us can relate to.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It's probably a more balanced lot than any other system's audience.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, that's my point. It goes across a wide age range. And bridges the gender gap like no other.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Part of what I love about Nintendo.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Let's talk games, though. I would ask you what GameCube game from E3 interested you the most...But, bar some huge surprise, I expect I already know the answer. Haha.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>I WONDER.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>So to get more specific, what do you think about Zelda from what you know?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Uh oh. I see Cory talking for 20 minutes.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Haha. Maybe we should just point out the key things.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Ha, I know a relatively average amount. I'm on a half-blackout. All I have to say is that its super-neato and I'll be playing it with my balls. That is all.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Good stuff.  At first I have to admit that I was a little disappointed about the move to more realistic visuals. But I like the art style a lot.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I was very excited from the trailer and footage shown at E3. It looks to have even more trademark Zelda polish than usual.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>The more I see it, the more I notice how fleshed-out everything is. Yeah, polish is definitely the word.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I hated how it all looked in the still photographs. Seeing it all in motion, it works.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I'm also pleased to hear about orchestrated music playing a role, I think that's a very nice move.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Horse combat looks fun and intuitive. As much as I can assume from seeing the video and reading <a href= https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=466>Travis and Chriss super N-Depth article on the game at E3</a>, at least.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, I have heard good things about the horse combat.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>I still don't think it's up to the quality of the horse animation in <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>, but still kickass regardless.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b><i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>...that's a whole other story! Haha. That's another one to watch out for.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah, that game looks very cool as well.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I can't help but feel that someone is reading my mind. I swear I had the idea for that game long ago, haha. The same thing happened with RE4. It's scary, but nice.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>That game is basically just 18 boss fights. It's pretty sweet.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, I love the concept of having an enormous enemy as both a boss and a level of sorts.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>But okay, besides Zelda, what impressed you guys?

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I am pretty interested in <i>Battalion Wars</i>. Everything I've read about it seems quite positive, which is nice to hear. And I'm intrigued to know how it will balance RTS-style gaming with the idea of controlling one character at a time. The concept seems a bit messy to me, but the impressions I've read reflect something that seems quite intuitive.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>On the Cube, I honestly wasn't overly impressed by anything other than Zelda. Nothing new, at least.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, I have to agree with that pretty much. Although, I will say that <i>Mario Strikers</i> looks great.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>As much as I hate to say it, <i>Super Mario Strikers</i> looked pretty fun to me.

<p align=center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/n-banter_06-20-2005_supermariostrikers.jpg"></p>

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah. Say what you will about Mario being everywhere, it looks fun. I like the idea of a crazy Mario-themed soccer match, with shells flying everywhere.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Yeah, it certainly looks fun.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Its art style and general direction appealed to me more than a lot of the Mario Sports games.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>It's definitely a lot more "hardcore." The art is all jagged and violent, and the game itself seems brutal.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I can't wait until 2006 when we get Mario Hockey and Mario Basketball...

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>It looks to me like it could have a frantic type of gameplay, like <i>Smash Bros.</i> and <i>Mario Kart</i>. If they pull that off well, it looks like it could be a pretty addictive multiplayer game.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Exactly James, though not as deep as <i>SSBM</i>. SSBM has so many variables that it never gets old. But yeah, <i>Super Mario Strikers</i> really seems to embrace the world of Mario to a greater degree than most of the games. I like that they aren't just using the same models from <i>Mario Tennis</i> and <i>Golf</i>. Those games need some variety in style and presentation.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Yeah, the art for <i>Strikers</i> does seem to go a bit further. I like what I've seen though.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>It seems like the game's less about soccer and more about kicking the ever-loving shit out of your opponents. Hell, even the sidelines electrocute you.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>That's partly why it looks so fun, haha. I really liked what I saw on video. The concept of being able to kick different Mario-esque objects around seems interesting anyway. 

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I'm just going to say it's the first Mario sports game I'm considering for purchase in quite a while. I count Mario Party in that loop.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Same here, Jeff. It seems to me that the real star of the show, in terms of playable software (and other than Zelda), was Nintendo DS.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The DS had a great show. I was really impressed.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I was surprised at PSP's apparently fairly weak showing at E3. Nintendo DS seemed to impress everybody.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>I worry about <i>Animal Crossing DS</i>. I mean, it's got new stuff -- new items, new little features, etc etc. But it still seems like the same old game. I won't be able to bear paying off my house all over again.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yup, it still looks like <i>AC</i> for GCN to me. 

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I have to agree with that, frankly. I'm hoping that there are some fundamentally new things. The online functionality is interesting, because I sort of wondered...what else can you do, other than chopping down trees, chatting and trading items?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It's kind of the same situation Harvest Moon is in. They need to do something new.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Yeah, the online seems pretty limited as is. I hope they can do more with it.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>If they only take what you can do now and build on that a little...then it seems to be a little pointless. At the end of the day, if Wi-Fi play only eliminates the need for passwords...then I'm not entirely sure how interested I'll be. Right now I'm more interested in <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i> and <i>Mario Kart DS</i>. I am impressed by the amount of stuff they are packing into <i>MKDS</i>.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Then again, relatively few people bought <i>AC</i> for GameCube. The DS has a much broader potential audience. So perhaps not as many changes are needed.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>That's true, if I didn't own <i>AC</i> on GameCube I'd probably pick up the DS version.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Yeah. <i>Animal Crossing</i> needed to be more of a MMO [Massively Multiplayer Online game] than just the GCN game with Wi-Fi instead of passwords. We needed people to be simultaneously living in the same town, not just visiting other ones. There is so much potential in certain franchises for things like this, and it sickens me when companies don't even TRY to fulfill it. I see the potential, but I know EXACTLY where the development's going to goand its the complete opposite direction.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>They can't really get too MMO though without charging people.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>If you can share a town with friends that would be great. I don't think it needs the depth of something like <i>EverQuest</i> or whatever, but there are some interesting things they could do with it on DS. I still like the idea of carving your own furniture with the stylus. Or using the stylus to design your own house (to actually build it, not just upgrade a pre-existing thing).

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Pokmons the biggest offender of all, in terms of not using a franchise's potential. <i>Pokmon XD</i> makes me sad. Supposedly it's going to be a "fully-fledged RPG!", but I see it using the exact same mechanics as <i>Pokmon Colosseum</i>. What the hell about <i>XD</i> is going to make it more "fully-fledged" than <i>Colosseum</i>?

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Wow, it's funny you mention that. <i>Pokmon XD</i> is the first Pokmon game that interests me since the first game, haha. Instead of getting proper RPGs like the original GB versions, we've been getting all of these battle games that I have no interest in.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>To be blunt, I absolutely DESPISE the "snatch" system pioneered in <i>Colosseum</i>. It feels unnatural and frustrating. I got to the point where if I found a dark pokmon I could snatch, I'd just kill it and move on.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I have not played it, but my understanding was that <i>Colosseum</i> only added RPG elements. But that it wasn't a full RPG first and foremost, in the same vein as the original <i>Blue</i> and <i>Red</i>. I've always thought, when playing Blue version, that they could do that so well in 3D.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>): I haven't played a Pokmon game since <i>Red</i> in 1997. It was very fun and I loved it. Every game since hasn't changed it up enough to interest me. I don't want to re-collect all the pokmon and even more. I want something new. New battle mechanics.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Well the things they could add to <i>Colosseum</i> to make it a "real" RPG aren't things that will remove the fundamental flaws that were built into the game. Now it'll just be a fully-fledged flawed RPG, instead of a half-assed flawed one.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>But are they building it on <i>Colosseum</i>? I mean, I thought they were basically doing a new game, more based on the traditional RPGs.

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>From what I've seen so far, it looks identical to <i>Colosseum</i>. It still uses the snatch mechanic, which eliminates an enormous chunk of the gameplay mechanics from the GB editions of the games.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Oh okay.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It is being made by the same team as <i>Colosseum</i>, I believe. And it has dark pokmon like <i>Colosseum</i>. 

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Yep. I understand the idea of breaking away from the "catch all the wild pokmon" option. The dark pokmon idea was an attempt at that, but I don't think it was a very good attempt, is the problem.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Definitely a bad one.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>If it ends up being something I'm more interested in, then I might buy it. But if it is just built on <i>Colosseum</i>, it might not be so appealing.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Here is what I want. I want to be Ash and play a game akin to <i>Pokmon Red</i> and <i>Blue</i> on GameCube except with a new form of battling. <i>Mario & Luigi</i> has kind of made me like real-time stuff in turn-based battles. Maybe that would work. The gotta catch em all mechanic is still something that is appealing. It's having to battle with an outdated system that bothers me. It isn't flexible enough for today.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I basically agree with you, Jeff. When I played Red and Blue I felt that it would have made a good 3D game. Over time I sort of wondered why Nintendo never made that obvious choice. 

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>There are fans of the franchise that SWEAR by the pokmon mechanics, though. The battling system, leveling up system, etc. That's the system I want to completely redo more than anything.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>I would tend to add a bit more to it and provide some flexibility

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Pokmon 3D would be better on Revolution, since Nintendo will be able to make grass. Wild Pokmon grass!

<p><b><font color="green">Cory: </font></b>Yes... the grass is a necessity.

<p><b><font color="blue">James: </font></b>Nothing like some good grass. <i>Wind Waker</i> continually reminds me of that.
