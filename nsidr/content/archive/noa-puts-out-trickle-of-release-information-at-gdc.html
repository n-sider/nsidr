Perhaps <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2661">gagged</a> by the pending major stock trade they are involved in, Nintendo is only talking about and showing a tiny handful of upcoming games this week at GDC.  Here's what they've got&mdash;and almost none of it is new information:<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Wii</div><br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Super Paper Mario</i> (April 9)</li>
  <li><i>Big Brain Academy</i> (June 11)</li>
  <li><i>Pokémon Battle Revolution</i> (June 25)</li>
  <li><i>Mario Strikers Charged</i> (Summer 2007)</li>
  </ul><br />
<div class="subheader">Nintendo DS</div><br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Pokémon Diamond Version</i>/<i>Pokémon Pearl Version</i> (April 22)</li>
  <li><i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i> (Holiday 2007)</li>
  </ul><br />
Of these titles, Pokémon Battle Revolution is perhaps most noteworthy as it takes the crown of the first title released to support the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection&mdash;in this instance, to enable online competitive play.  Battle Revolution is also the first title to link with the Nintendo DS, letting players use the DS as a controller or (surprise) execute Pokémon transfer from Diamond and Pearl.<br />
<br />
What's happening with Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is interesting.  At E3 2006 last year, both a single-player demo and multiplayer demo were present.  According to released materials, Nintendo is only showing the multiplayer demo at E3 this year.  Is it possible that Nintendo is reworking the single-player adventure to a degree that a demo is not currently possible?  Time will tell.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, once the stock trade is complete and the gag is lifted, we'll be getting a much fuller list of upcoming titles from Nintendo.  Stay tuned.
