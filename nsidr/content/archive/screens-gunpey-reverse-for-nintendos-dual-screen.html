<p>Screens are now available for Connect the Sounds! Gunpey Reverse, a Nintendo DS title announced by developer Q Entertainment <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2271">yesterday</a>.  Gunpey Reverse will be published by Namco Bandai later this year. Tetris-style gameplay involves diagonal lines moving from the bottom of the screen to the top. It's up to the player to use the Nintendo DS stylus to arrange the diagonal pieces so they form a complete line, which will then disappear. Each cleared line emits a sound that can be matched with background music. The game ends if the screen is filled.</p>
