<p>Remember <cite>Tingle RPG</cite>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1362">announced back in October</a>?  Famitsu has <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/blog98046_Blakguy">new screens</a> of the title, now referred to as (depending on who you ask, something similar to) <cite>Tingle in Rupee Land</cite>.</p>

<p>The story appears to be following the life of a younger Tingle, though it's unclear as of yet what the adventure is about.  <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?s=372816f56d106295b0ef2e8c277ce644&t=105013">Speculation is rife</a> over at NeoGAF, of course.  If we find out more, we'll let you know.</p>
