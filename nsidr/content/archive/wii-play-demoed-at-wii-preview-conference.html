<p>Our own <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=7">Anthony Calderon</a> was at Nintendo's Wii Preview event in New York yesterday, and spent a good amount of time looking over the games that Nintendo had available to play.</p>

<p>Especially of note was a kiosk hidden in the back and hardly noticed exhibiting <cite>Wii Play</cite>&mdash;also known as <cite>Hajime no Wii</cite> ("My First Wii") in Japan.  The title is a compilation of various smaller games including Duck Hunt/Target Shooting, Pool, Ping Pong, Air Hockey, Remote Pointer Demo, Quiz Matching Game, and "a weird sort of simple fishing game that plays almost like bobbing for apples".  In addition, two mystery games were part of the title, but were not unlocked for play.</p>

<p>Anthony says the games did not seem to be as polished as <cite>Wii Sports</cite>.  They were multiplayer-oriented and quicker-paced.  Though Nintendo is not presently saying anything about Wii Play for U.S. release, it seems likely that if they've titled it and demoed it that they are at least considering bringing it to North America for launch or soon thereafter.</p>
