<P>Craig from <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/711/711570p1.html">IGN</a> sends word that <i>Point Blank DS</i>, a charming, handheld version of Namco's ridiculous GunCon shooting gallery game, is to make a surprisingly out-of-the-blue appearance on North American shores next week.</P>

<br>
<P>The game focuses primarily on pattern and recognition tasks, with emphasis on strict time limits, false targets, and limited ammunition.  The GunCon gun controller is replaced with the stylus.  This writer had five minutes of a time with the quirky little title at E3... consider picking this up with your shiny new DS Lite next week.</P>
