<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3229-1.jpg" width="200" height="180" class="image_styled" /></div>A little over a week ago, box art for the European release of Disney's <i>Meteos: Disney Magic</i> surfaced with a curious decoration: the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection logo.<br />
<br />
This spawned speculation that the title would feature online play, a first for the Meteos franchise on the DS.  N-Sider went digging for the straight answer to this question and it turns out, as we were told by representatives, that the game is not actually playable online.  Wireless play is still supported, as it was in the North American and Japanese releases, including single-card DS Download Play, for multiplayer games with only one game card.<br />
<br />
Meteos: Disney Magic will release in Europe on June 1st.  It's already available in North America and Japan, and is, in this writer's view, an <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=584">enjoyable</a> experience.
