<p><b>Super Paper Mario</b><br>
Format: Nintendo GameCube<br>
Launch Date: Q4 2006<br>
ESRB: RP (Rating Pending)<br>
Game Type: 2-D/3-D Sidescrolling Platformer with Role-Playing Elements<br>
Players: 1<br>
Developer: Intelligent Systems</p>

<p><ul>
<li>The newest chapter of the Paper Mario story isn't just out of this world; it's out of this
dimension.
<li>What at first glance appears to be a 2-D sidescroller ripped straight from the pages
of the Paper Mario universe soon turns into a 3-D action-adventure that defies all
video game logic. Fusing 2-D and 3-D perspectives, not to mention RPG and
platformer elements, the game slips back and forth between dimensions. The
action sprawls across eight worlds filled with traps, puzzles, bizarre mysteries and
items that often draw themselves out of thin air.
<li>Oh, and just because Mario's in the title doesn't mean he's the only star - players
also get to play as Peach and Bowser.
  </ul></p>
