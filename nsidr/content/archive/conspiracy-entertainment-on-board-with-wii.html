Conspiracy Entertainment, developer, publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment, announced yesterday it intends to develop games for Wii.  Wii will join Game Boy Advance, GameCube, and DS among Conspiracy's stable of supported platforms.<br />
<br />
Conspiracy's latest offering is <i>Pocket Pool</i> for the PlayStation Portable, offering pool and earning its M rating due to the "partial nudity" of the "Dream Models" therein.  The company has also, as of late, released a handful of UMD movies for the same platform, as well as puzzle game <i>Ultimate Block Party</i> (also for the PSP) and several Flash movies and games on its website.
