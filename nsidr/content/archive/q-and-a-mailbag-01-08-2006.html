<p><b>Edition: 01-08-2006</b>

<p>Its 2006, the columns up, and its a Sunday. I know youre all proud. I am a bit disappointed in the number of letters I received over the holidays. Three is not a large number. But they were good letters, so I wont bring the static stick out just yet. I want to see some effort on your part though. Send your your questions, criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>.

<p>In this edition, we talk about future Wi-Fi DS games, Super Smash Bros. Melee turnips, 4ColorRebellion, and the future of N-Sider itself.

<h3>Future Wi-Fi DS games</h3>
<p>Hey guys,

<p>I have a question about the Nintendo WFC. Do you know if Nintendo has any plans for a wi-fi enabled DS game after MP:Hunters? It seems like after that Nintendo and Third-party Companies have no plans for online games.  Also, do you guys think any Revolution launch titles will be online or will we have to wait till later?

<p>Thanks a lot,

<p>- Eric

<p><b>Jeff: </b>There are plenty of Wi-Fi enabled games on the horizon. Nintendo has a history of not revealing what titles are set for release past the spring season until their fiscal year ends in March. I suspect that well hear a bevy of DS online game announcements come the 2006 E3 Expo. Im personally hoping for an online Smash Bros DS and Four Sword DS. Im sure there will be some great original games announced as well. Check out Glens <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=490>Wi-Fi Connection FAQ</a> for a listing of online games we are aware of for the WFC.

<h3>Peachs turnip troubles</h3>
<p>Hey, I don't know if you're the person I need to talk to, but I am a HUGE fan of super smash bros. melee and I really really really would like to know the algorithm that determines what turnip peach will pull up.  Barring that, is there any way to predict what turnip.item she'll get?  I've been playing this game for years and I can't figure it out.  If you know who I would need to talk to to get this question answered I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for your time.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>If I only knew, my friend. Ive been playing Melee consistently for the last four years and I have yet to be able to pull the turnip I want. The same goes for Luigis Forward+B charging attack. However, I did find a list of all the types of things Peach can pull up, their damage, and your chance of pulling them. Hopefully that will help you a bit. If not, blame Cory. Hes the Smash Bros. god at N-Sider. If we dont know something, its his fault.

<ul>
<li>Standard Turnip: 58% chance of appearance, 8% damage
<li>Sick Turnip: 12% chance, 8% damage
<li>Confused Turnip: 9% chance, 8% damage
<li>Sleepy Turnip: 6% chance, 8% damage
<li>Happy Turnip: 6% chance, 8% damage
<li>Winking Turnip: 4% chance, 12% damage
<li>Content Turnip: 3% chance, 18-20% damage
<li>Old Turnip: 1% chance, 34-38% damage
<li>Bob-omb: 1% chance, 35% damage
<li>Mr. Saturn: 1% chance, 7-11% damage
  </ul>

<h3>Best letter ever</h3>
<p>Hey N-Sider staff,

<p>My name's Nick Rumas, I write for <a href=http://www.4colorrebellion.com>4ColorRebellion</a>, in particular a column called 'Playing Nintendo'. I just wanted to tell you what an awesome site I think N-Sider is. The angle you come from is so much different other Nintendo-related sites, and I love the in-depth profiles you feature. Awesome stuff that simply can't be found anywhere else. You even made IGN cool for a while with those awesome crossover features!

<p>Thanks for always providing such cool content.

<p>Looking forward to more"

<p>- Nick Rumas

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Thanks very much for all of the praise. Im not exactly sure when 4ColorRebellion popped up, but weve gotten numerous neat news stories from you guys and Ive read quite a few of your columns. In particular, I enjoyed your recent Twilight story and the volume you wrote right after the Revolution controller was revealed. Good stuff.

<p>I do feel a bit bad when we get letters like this though. As it stands, N-Sider is still but a shell of what it could be. Cory and I are very aware of this. We have so much content (both finished and on the backburner) that we cant launch yet for varying reasons. At this point, our ambition is getting the best of us. I wouldnt rule out a rosy future though. Im very confident in the talents of our current writing and art staff.

<p>2006 will bring change for N-Sider. Its going to be a very good year.
