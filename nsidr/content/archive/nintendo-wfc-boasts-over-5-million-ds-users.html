The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service has reached yet another milestone: over 5 million unique Nintendo DS owners have used the service.  These players are responsible for over 200 million sessions. The top five DS games played online, out of almost 65 capable titles, are <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World, Mario Kart DS, Metroid Prime Hunters, Pokémon Diamond</i> and <i>Pokémon Pearl</i>.<br />

NOA President Reggie Fils-Aime is satisfied with WFC's success. "Nintendo DS gamers globally use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection as an easy, fun place to find fellow players, all without paying anything extra for the service," he explains. "The milestones represent millions of hours of fun and camaraderie despite miles between players."<br />

The DS itself is still enjoying record-breaking sales. According to numbers from NPD, the DS sold more than 470,000 units in the US in the month of April alone, giving it the top spot in hardware sales once again. DS purchases by women have increased over 42% in less than 18 months, and sales to people over 35 have increased 212%&mdash;leading Nintendo to note that DS is expanding the game market.
