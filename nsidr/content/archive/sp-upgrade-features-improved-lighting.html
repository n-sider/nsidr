<p><a href="http://www.edge-online.co.uk/">Edge Online</a> is reporting that Nintendo is quietly rolling out an upgrade to the venerable Game Boy Advance SP featuring a new "markedly brighter" screen light as well as a light switch capable of two levels of brightness.</p>

<p>Although not mentioned in the Edge story, other reports indicate that the improved lighting will only be available in the new Graphite and Pearl Blue edition SPs, at least for the time being.</p>
