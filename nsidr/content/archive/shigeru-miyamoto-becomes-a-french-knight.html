<p><a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news14929_shigeru-miyamoto-a-paris.html">Jeux-France</a> was on location today to witness Nintendo designer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, along with Michel Ancel (Rayman, Beyond Good and Evil, King Kong) and Frederick Raynal (Alone in the Dark), become the first video game creators knighted by Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres into into France's Order of Arts and Letters. This recognition bestows video games with the distinction of being a cultural art form in France.

<p>Donnedieu de Vabres described the men as "modern creators who gave birth to characters, playful worlds, dreamlike universes, straight from their imaginations, drawing in tens, maybe even hundreds of millions of gamers throughout the world."  N-Sider would like to congratulate Miyamoto, Ancel, and Raynal as well as the medium of interactive entertainment.</p>
