<p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/1002dnbusGamestop.213241d.html">DallasNews</a> reports that GameStop will be the only retailer with playable Wii demo kiosks this holiday.  The company revealed the news on Saturday during its annual sales conference in Dallas.</p>

<p>GameStop also said it has not determined if it will offer pre-orders for the Wii.  The sparse supply during the launch of the Microsoft Xbox 360 last year has made GameStop reluctant.  "We did learn a lesson last year," said Steve Morgan, president of GameStop. "I think the lesson is caution and optimism at the same time."</p>
