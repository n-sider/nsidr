Last week, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe partnered with Eurogamer.net to allow 5000 lucky (and alert) gamers to participate in a limited beta of <i>Little Big Planet</i> for the PlayStation 3.<br />
<br />
Multiple server errors and registration form mishaps later, I was lucky enough to be a part of the small chunk of gamers who got an early look at one of this season's most anticipated titles: <i>Little Big Planet</i>.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
I've now had a few days to play the three-level beta (it's essentially just a demo under the guise of a "beta test" for stress testing the servers), and I must say this game has lived up to every bit of hype I'd set myself up for. The three levels that are included in the beta serve as your simple introduction and tutorial modes&#8212;they help you better understand your Poppit (your in-game menu for sticker-madness, among other things) and how to successfully navigate through the labyrinth of puzzles that present themselves to you.<br />
<br />
I won't dwell on the tutorial stages, as the real meat-and-potatoes come in the level creation mode.<br />
<br />

Developer Media Molecule was kind enough to include a full-fledged creation mode into the beta (while some objects are absent, there is quite literally a plethora of items and stickers to unlock), and it has spawned some pretty incredible levels so far from the other few thousand folks in the beta.<br />
<br />
I should note something that tickled my fancy in particular: playing the tutorials, or watching the videos for certain objects, gave me a very strong <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> feeling.  If there was one thing about the omnipresent British voice-overs that accompany the how-to portions of the game that could have been better, it would have been Stephen Fry.<br />
<br />
As I write this, the beta has been going on for a little under a week and the quality of levels being created has gone up exponentially as each day passes. I've read that levels created during the beta test will be kept on the servers for when the game ships retail, so all our work has not been in vain!<br />
<br />
I don't think words can describe how incredible this game is, and once word gets around about <i>Little Big Planet</i> I have no doubt in my mind Sony will see some system sales as a result of the cult phenomenon this game likely will become.<br />
<br />
The level creation mode gives you unlimited possibilities, from rocket powered horses to <i>Sonic</i> inspired races, and the range of levels being created has far exceeded any expectation I had of the community playing the game. <br />
<br />
I'd like to share one level in particular that has impressed me beyond that of anything I could have imagined would come from the player community. It's simply titled "Little Big Colossus," inspired by <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>:<br />

<br />
After seeing this level, I was inspired to go ahead and create some things of my own. Here are two of my levels.  The first one I created before I had the chance to play the above level, and the second one is the result of being inspired by something so impressive.<br />

As you can see, the sheer amount of content being produced (with a limited palette) in just four short days is uncanny. I can't wait to see what gets created when the masses get a hold of this gem come mid-October.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a PS3 yet, and have been on the fence waiting for a game to be the reason to take the plunge, consider letting <i>Little Big Planet</i> be that reason.
