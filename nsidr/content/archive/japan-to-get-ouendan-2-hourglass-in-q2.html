Courtesy NeoGAF's jonnyram comes a handful of rather important <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=150378">release dates</a> for Japan.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2</i> (May 17)</li>
  <li><i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i> (June 23)</li>
  <li><i>DK Bongo Blast</i> ((June 28)</li>
  </ul><br />
Though Ouendan 2 is most likely not going to make an appearance on these shores, Phantom Hourglass most certainly is, and Bongo Blast is highly likely&mdash;when we hear what NOA's plans are regarding those titles, we'll certainly let you know.
