Midway plans to display a wealth of games at this week's E3.  The company has a few games scheduled for release on Wii and Nintendo DS and has several more allocated to the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC platforms.  One of the more notable announced games is perhaps the Wii exclusive <i>Cruis'n</i>, a franchise that was previously very popular in arcades and on Nintendo 64.<br />
