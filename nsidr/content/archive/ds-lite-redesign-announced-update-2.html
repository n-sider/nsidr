<P>Nintendo <a href ="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/news/06126.html"> has announced a redesign</A> of the Nintendo DS, called Nintendo DS Lite.  Slated for a March 2nd release in Japan, it will boast brighter screens than its predecessor at the same size.  Nintendo DS Lite will be 20% lighter, weighing in at a mere 218g - 52g less than the  original DS for all you mathophiles.  Its measurements are 133mm x 73.9mm x 21.5mm.  Now that's sexy!</p>

<P>No North American or European release date yet, but keep checking for new information at N-Sider, or on <a href="http://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo's Official Site.</A> </P>

<p>The official release information is available (in Japanese) at Nintendo's official website <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/news/060126.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Update</b> by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=40">Matt</a>: 1UP has <a href="http://1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147494">confirmed the presence of SLOT-2</a>, used for Game Boy Advance titles and Option Paks such as the Rumble Pak and the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=977">Daigasso! Band Brothers</a> Request Selection expansion.  In addition, the official announcement from Nintendo indicates there may be new screen technology in the Lite, as Nintendo is saying there are four selectable brightness levels for the screens.</p>

<p>Still no news on a stateside release.  If Revolution does indeed hit in November, it's possible this baby may drop in the summer so that Nintendo's not in the position of competing with themselves on two newly-released hardware platforms.</p>

<p><b>Update 2</b> by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=40">Matt</a>: We originally reported that the screens on the Lite were 2/3 smaller than the original DS design; this appears to not be the case.  Both 1UP's story as well as some quick scale comparisons with the official pictures indicate that the screens are precisely the same size they are in the original DS design.  Our apologies for any confusion this may have caused.</p>
