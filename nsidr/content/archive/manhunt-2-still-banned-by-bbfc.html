The British Board of Film Classification has reviewed the new version of Rockstar's <i>Manhunt 2</i> and once again deemed it <a href="http://www.gamersreports.com/news/6718/bbfc-rejects-revised-version-of-manhunt-2/">unsuitable</a> for consumers. The BBFC's director, David Cooke, had some words to say:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The changes made to the game do not go far enough to address the BBFC's concerns.</li>
  <li>The visual detail of some of the execution kills is reduced, but others retain their original casually sadistic nature.</li>
  <li>The bleak and callous tone has remained unchanged.</li>
  </ul>
