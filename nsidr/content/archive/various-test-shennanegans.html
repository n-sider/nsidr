NSMB Wii<br />
<br />
Looks like the visuals of NSMB combined with Mario All Stars, level design of NSMB meets Mario World, with some new in there<br />
<br />
There was a time when Nintendo hadn't nailed down their character design.  Mario would look different from game to game, along with all his foes.  The graphical abilities of the hardware were letting Nintendo reinvent it all over and over again, refining and refining.  Once they moved to CG character models, and started basing the in-game art on approximating (and eventually achieving) those models, the games all started to feel more homogenized.  This is likely to blame for why newer Mario games don't always feel as "charming" as older ones.  The design for a Koopa Troopa is nailed down now, and he's gonna be showing up the same every time.<br />
<br />
(Curiously, Mario Galaxy bucked this trend, with new designs for a lot of his enemies, and even mario a little bit, he's maybe a little pudgey in certain spots, isn't he?  Regardless, Go Mario Galaxy.  Koopa Troopas on four legs?  Who would have thunk it!)<br />
<br />
NSMB doesn't buck it, unfortunately, and we're back to the stock designs.  Mario and Co look just like higher-poly versions of NSMB, which was really just based on designs from Mario 64 DS.  That tall/thin mario with the long arms.<br />
<br />
(Though arguably, that's maybe the POINT of "New" Super Mario Bros.)<br />
<br />
There was EXPRESSION on their spritey little faces!  Just the act of looking up before entering a castle in mario world conveyed all sorts of whatnot.  These new models though, they're dead.  They're puppets.<br />

For example, most of us are aware of reports that suggest a declining interest in videogames among so-called "core gamers". Such reports indicate the source of the phenomenon as being primarily Japan-centric, but a combination of industry analysts and publishing representatives have begun pointing to what they see as early signs of a similar trend emerging in the United States and other western markets.<br />

<ul>
  <li>Pokemon tagged/collared, need license to have them out and about in non-battle settings, some simply aren't street legal due to size or temperament</li>
  <li>Pokemon could wander off if taken out while not properly trained.  Other trainers could find them and return them to the owner</li>
  </ul>
