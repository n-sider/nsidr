<P>Joystiq is reporting on a fellow who blogs over at <a href="http://www.ianalbert.com/misc/mapphotos.php">this site</a> and, through his work, has access to an 18 megapixel display (resolution of about 6000x3000 pixels).  What's the first thing he thinks to do with it?</P>

<P>Display enormous old-school RPG maps, that's what!  There're a couple shots of Zelda, one of Ultima 7, and a few Link to the Past.  It's sort of worth checking out, in that "I completely have a million other things to be doing but I'm absolutely dying to view something on the Internet that nobody in my family would find amusing except me" way.</P>
