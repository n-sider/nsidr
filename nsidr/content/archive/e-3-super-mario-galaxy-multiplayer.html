<p>Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that Super Mario Galaxy for Nintendo Wii will feature a two player mode with the possibility of a mode with up to four players. Miyamoto said he hadn't decided on the gameplay for additional players but suggested that they might be able to compete and/or interfere with the single player.  Earlier today Miyamoto also mentioned the possibility that Super Mario Galaxy will not be ready in time for launch, yet it will definitely make it out within the following six months after launch.  Stay tuned for more details.</p>
