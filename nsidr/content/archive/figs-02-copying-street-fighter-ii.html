  Nintendo Power, Volume 38.<br />
  On the cover: Street Fighter II.<br />
  Inside the issue: <i>Panic Restaurant</i>, <i>NCAA Basketball</i>, <i>Might and<br />
  Magic</i>, <i>Magic Sword</i>.<br />
  <br />
  It's 1992 and the only things I'm really concerned with are school, Nintendo, and Nintendo Power magazine because it's my only source of outside information from people who seem to give more than half a damn about something I'm involved with.<br />
  <br />
  After school the new Nintendo Power's here and it's got Guile on the cover.  This issue makes me long even more strongly for a Super Nintendo of my very own.  Also, there is a game inside called Panic Restaurant and it is for the NES.  I will never purchase the game, but will remember it fondly from this point forward in time, to the extent that I one day muse about it in an online gaming column.<br />
  <br />
  There's a Pizza Ranch restaurant in a neighboring town with its very own Street Fighter II arcade machine.  I visit with my parents every now and then and plunk down a few quarters.  It occurs to me frequently that I've never heard of <i>Street Fighter I</i>. <br />
  <div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-4.jpg" width="187" height="275" class="image_styled" /></div>&lt;P&rt;Artist's rendition of author in 1992.  Author belatedly apologizes for the blue <br />
  <br />
  shirt and black bow-tie combo, even though this artist's rendition actually looks <br />
  <br />
  nothing like the author and was merely harvested from a Google image search.&lt;/P&rt;<br />
  &lt;hr&rt;<br />
  <div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-1.jpg" width="222" height="109" class="image_styled" /></div>&lt;P&rt;This lovely pink fighter on the left began to show up in Capcom fighters around <br />
  <br />
  the time of &lt;i&rt;Street Fighter Alpha II&lt;/i&rt;.  It's never made painfully clear, but <br />
  <br />
  Dan Hibiki, our favorite pink-clad warrior, was actually a knock to all of SNK's <br />
  <br />
  fighting games and an obviously comical parallel of the SNK fighter on the right, <br />
  <br />
  Ryo Sakazaki.  Since Capcom believed Ryo to be such a poor imitation of their own <br />
  <br />
  Ryu character, they created Dan as an inferior copy of SNK's Ryo.  Dan's <br />
  <br />
  animations and fighting style were very much inspired by that of Ryo.  It's no <br />
  <br />
  surprise that Dan is one of the most worthless characters in the Street Fighter <br />
  <br />
  line-up.&lt;/P&rt;<br />
  &lt;P&rt;...and knowing is half the battle.<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-2.jpg" width="218" height="140" class="image_styled" /></div>&lt;P&rt;&lt;i&rt;Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture&lt;/i&rt; is really the first anime I ever had <br />
  <br />
  exposure to.  My stepbrother got it at a garage sale across the street for a <br />
  <br />
  dollar or two and I made sure to borrow it from him and watch it at least thirty <br />
  <br />
  or forty times.&lt;/p&rt;<br />
  &lt;P&rt;Though I'm not entirely big on anime -- with the exception of the extreme <br />
  <br />
  Evangelion phase I went through -- I think FF:tMP has the same allure today as it <br />
  <br />
  did then.  Rockin' fight scenes, incredible artistic flair, half-naked (and in <br />
  <br />
  Mai's case, naked from the waist up) girls prancing about, and a pretty exciting <br />
  <br />
  "track down the armor of Mars" storyline keep you pretty interested throughout.  <br />
  <br />
  And if you get bored of it you can always just throw it on loop and watch Mai take <br />
  <br />
  a shower for forty-five minutes.&lt;/P&rt;<br />
  &lt;hr&rt;<br />
  <div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-6.jpg" width="151" height="245" class="image_styled" /></div>&lt;P&rt;Did you know...&lt;/P&rt;<br />
  &lt;P&rt;The very first &lt;i&rt;Street Fighter&lt;/i&rt; machine didn't actually originally have <br />
  <br />
  the traditional joystick and six-button layout that we so commonly associate with <br />
  <br />
  &lt;i&rt;Street Fighter II&lt;/i&rt;, all its successors, and most other modern fighting <br />
  <br />
  games.  Initially, the prototype of &lt;i&rt;SF&lt;/i&rt; was playtested with <br />
  <br />
  pressure-sensitive panels that would be physically beat on by the player to <br />
  <br />
  determine how hard the player was punching or kicking the opponent.  An <br />
  <br />
  interesting and innovative idea in theory, the pressure-sensitive pads were <br />
  <br />
  quickly replaced with the traditional six-button layout after the test machine <br />
  <br />
  suffered incredible damage at the hands (and, according to some re-counts, <br />
  <br />
  dropkicks) of impressionable young kids.  To think that the six-button layout may <br />
  <br />
  never have become standard...&lt;/p&rt;<br />
  &lt;P&rt;...and knowing is half the battle.&lt;/p&rt;<br />
  &lt;hr&rt;<br />
  <div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-7.jpg" width="217" height="201" class="image_styled" /></div>&lt;P&rt;&lt;i&rt;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&lt;/i&rt; is another entertaining <br />
  <br />
  game-to-anime conversion that went pretty well.  This one's funtastic for many of <br />
  <br />
  the same reasons that &lt;i&rt;FF:tMP&lt;/i&rt; is, too: neat fights and special effects, <br />
  <br />
  pretty quality animation, and a Chun-Li shower scene since Capcom's just never one <br />
  <br />
  to be one-upped by other fighting ladies, I guess.&lt;/P&rt;<br />
  &lt;P&rt;As an aside, I got this one in a heavily edited PG-13 version with crappy <br />
  <br />
  English rock music and a really chopped up and edited nudie scene.  I guess if you <br />
  <br />
  only watch anime movies for animated boobies you can just skip out on this version <br />
  <br />
  of the film.&lt;/P&rt;<br />
  &lt;P&rt;Also you are a pervert and I like and respect you in a very strange manner.&lt;/P&rt;<br />

  <div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-3.jpg" width="215" height="152" class="image_styled" /></div>&lt;P&rt;SNK, makers of the many-times-mentioned-in-this-column &lt;i&rt;Fatal Fury&lt;/i&rt;, <br />
  <br />
  &lt;i&rt;Last Blade&lt;/i&rt;, &lt;i&rt;King of Fighters&lt;/i&rt;, and &lt;i&rt;Art of Fighting&lt;/i&rt; game series <br />
  <br />
  actually tried their collective hands at a home console in early 1990.  The system <br />
  <br />
  touted exact replications of the original arcade experiences that gamers had been <br />
  <br />
  having in Wal-Mart lobbies and stripmalls everywhere.  Though the hardware was <br />
  <br />
  powerful and provided the closest experience a hardcore gamer could get to the <br />
  <br />
  true arcade machine at home at the time, the devastating price point of over $399 <br />
  <br />
  USD for the system and upwards of hundreds of dollars for the often over-200 <br />
  <br />
  megabit cartridges sent the system spiraling into expensive fringe obscurity.  It <br />
  <br />
  later turned to excessive drug and alcohol abuse and close friends have gone on <br />
  <br />
  the record as saying it just hasn't been the same since [Neo-Geo] left us.&lt;/P&rt;<br />

<div class="header">02: Copying Street Fighter II</div><br />
Imitation's the most sincere form of flattery, or at least that might have been what Capcom believed Data East was thinking when Data East's <i>Fighter's History</i> was released.  Hitting arcades just shortly after Capcom's painstakingly created <i>Street Fighter II</i> had taken the world by the storm and force of at least 60,000 sexy women with blue clothes and bulging thighs, Fighter's History sported such seeming lifts from the Capcom opus as "Ray," the fireball-tossing USA-born martial artist, and "Liu," the Chinese "Mantis Style Master."  It used similar controls for similar moves, and even sported likenesses in graphical style.  <br />
<br />
The game wasn't as good as the raging hot SFII, though, and fight fans pretty much knew that.  The bottom line with gamers at the time was that Fighter's History tried, it sure did, real darn hard, but it just wasn't a very good attempt at mimicking <i>The World Warrior</i>'s gameplay.  Fighter's History didn't do much except flounder at the arcades&#8212;but as the wayward fighter began to draw its own audiences Capcom decided they weren't going to stomach Data East's half-hearted attempt to cash-in on SFII's popularity without at least a few dry heaves.<br />
<br />
So, unfortunately for Data East, Capcom felt like they'd enjoy suing the literal pants off of the would-be flatterers this time around, and instead of Chun-Li's open-arms companionship, the now-sans-pants imitators would find only a proposed legal battle and the potentially terrifying clamp of Capcom's millions of dollars around whatever it was that can lie underneath the pants of a non-human corporate entity.<br />
<br />
Though a valiant battle ensued, the case was thrown out for some reason I'm not entirely sure of.  It may have had something to do with the judges thinking that video games are not real life and they had better crap to do and better parties to hit up after this case was over.  <br />
<br />
In a weird future-round of Street Fighter II, this legal scuffle could have probably started out seeming something like your typical Akuma vs. Dan Hibiki, with Akuma representing Capcom and the nearly assured win over SNK's Dan in a devastating legal-system destruction.  But in this odd and hypothetical bout, Akuma ends up a whining water chestnut and Dan becomes a triumphant player of water polo.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-8.jpg" width="410" height="110" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
The case dismissal was really a huge victory for Data East, a games publisher that now not only had a really shitty fighting game on their hands, but a really <i>legal</i> really shitty fighting game.  From there, the flood gates were opened and several games companies commenced with their individual Plan Xs, most of them consisting of "rip off Street Fighter II because it's legal to do it now."<br />
<br />
We know where factual history stands, but I'm not going to take all that legal mumbo jumbo and all those silly "facts" without doing some pondering myself.  Are you going to accept the mumbo?  Are you going to beg the elephants for mercy when they crush your lemming-like skulls collectively and merrily into the ground?  Or are you going to come with me on a sweet trip down memory lane and the discared shells of would-be Street Fighters?  I knew you'd say that!<br />

I started thinking the other day at work between boxing winches and moving boxes onto pallets. Thinking about the very "coincidental" similarities between Street Fighter II, Fighter's History, <i>Fatal Fury</i>, and <i>Art of Fighting</i>, that big slew of fighters that all happened to come out at around the same time.  I sort of recalled that there was a legal battle between Capcom and Data East a while back that got thrown out, but I couldn't really decide whether or not I agreed with it based on mere merit and general recollection alone.  It was research time and I was going to research for the sake of <i>the column</i>.  My pride was at hand, I was pretty sure, and so when I got home, I loaded up my perfectly legal non-emulated copies of all of those games which I paid full price for in a retail chain and got to taking notes.  Here are some shockingly innovative observations I came up with.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Street Fighter II is really the most fun to play.</li>
  <li>Fatal Fury has some style, but I'm mostly biased because I've seen the anime movie based on it a whole bunch of times.</li>
  <li>Art of Fighting has pretty bad controls and relatively uninspired characters.</li>
  <li>So does Fighter's History.</li>
  <li>Ryu is way cooler than "Ray" and "Ryo," but slightly <br />
less cool than "Terry Bogard."</li>
  <li>"Terry Bogard" is a relatively stupid name for a main character.</li>
  <li>There are only three controllable main characters in Fatal Fury.  That is also stupid.</li>
  <li>The actual gameplay mechanics of Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury are better than Fighter's History's fighting system, but are a little lacking when compared to Street Fighter II.</li>
  <li>Street Fighter II has better noises when you punch or kick someone.  In Fatal Fury it sounds like you're kicking a drum coated in Saran Wrap.</li>
  </ul><br />
As you can see, there are some pretty marked differences between all of the titles.  I think that at this point, I was pretty much completely assured that this ripping off of SFII was very much prime material for Figs.  It's interesting, it's lame, and it reeks of a half-assed job, I was thinking.  Then I found one more really big thing which I decided to waste a lot of this column on and create a big graphic about: the truly uncanny similarities in the "fireball" motions and special moves throughout the games.  I took some screenshots to prepare this Figs special feature respectably titled <br />
<br />
"Goodness, Gracious! Similar Balls of Fire."<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-409-8.jpg" width="410" height="110" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
Ryu's classic Hadoken uses exactly the same button combinations as the typical fireball moves from Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting, <b>and</b> Fighter's History?  To me, this seemed fairly suspicious.  To my knowledge, that particular quarter-circle forward roll had yet to be used in any fighting game, let alone any game <i>at all</i> prior to Street Fighter II.  I guess the first installment of the Street Fighter series might have used it too, but that's irrelevant.  And keep in mind those pictures up there are just the only games I had the ambition to play and document for this article.  Off-hand, I'm pretty sure that <i>Killer Instinct's</i> Fulgore has a dashing move that uses the <br />
D, DF, F + Punch combination, some crappy dinosaur in the perhaps best-forgotten <i>Primal Rage</i> has one, and I used one last week when I had to be all up in some dude's face cause he was like "hey I want the last Coke" and I was like "no me now step off" and he was like "hey you dang ragamuffin go home to your wife, percy" and I was like oh that's it now you're in for it" and I busted his ass with a Hadoken.<br />
<br />
I know there's one in some weird Super Famicom <i>Sailor Moon</i> fighting game I played once, and I can confirm that "Bean the Dynamite Duck," a hidden character in the Sega Saturn game <i>Fighters Megamix</i>, also has an attack called "Round <br />
and Round" which uses the D, DF, F + Punch combination.  I'm sure there are hundreds but I tried to stay away from other Capcom or SNK games for flavor.  <br />
<br />
<i>Last Blade</i>, <i>Waku Waku 7<i>, <i>Voltage Fighter Gowkaiser</i>, countless other <i>King of Fighters</i> and Fatal Fury games, and all the other Street Fighter sequels also use the D, DF, F + Punch combinations.  I don't really know what my point is on that excessive tirade, other than that it certainly seems to me like Data East, if not most of the entire gaming industry, took a little piece of Street Fighter II to the arcades with them when Data East's case got dumped in court.<br />
<br />
Now that the 2D fighter genre has really started to trickle off (with a few scarce exceptions) in favor of glitzy three-dimensional brawlers like the admittedly kick-ass <i>Soul Calibur</i> and the oft-sequelfied <i>Tekken</i>, developers are less and less copying the once-kingly greatness of Street Fighter II.  To many new gamers, the idea of a two-dimensional fighting game is likely archaeic, ancient, and tired.  To many long-time gamers, the concept of a fighter without a D, DF, F + Punch fireball is bizarre.<br />
<br />
One can only wonder how far along the fighting genre would really be without Street Fighter II and all the rip-offs and imitations that came of it.  And how far behind we'd be if developers hadn't ever stopped following the fad and ripping it off.
