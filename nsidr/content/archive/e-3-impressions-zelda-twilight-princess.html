<p>As you all know, the newest Zelda iteration is playable at Nintendo's E3 booth.  There are two demos: one bare-bones dungeon and one fishing minigame.</p>

<P>The dungeon is located mostly outdoors in a Gerudo-esque canyon.  As far as we can tell, there are four different enemy types -- two mobile enemies, one a bokoblin grunt and the other a type of lizalfos; one fire arrow-slinging sentry; and the boss, an enormous being of shadow and fire.</P>

<P>The fishing demo is more simplistic.  Link paddles around a lake in a canoe with an unidentified female and attempts to catch fish.  The Wii remote is his fishing rod, and the casting motion is nearly identical to a real life fishing experience.</P>

<P>Look for more in-depth coverage and impressions later this week.</P>
