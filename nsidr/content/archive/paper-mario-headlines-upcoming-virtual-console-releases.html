Nintendo of America's official Nintendo Power magazine covers upcoming Virtual Console releases within its pages every month.  This month, they've revealed that the Nintendo 64 classic <i>Paper Mario</i>, predecessor to the GameCube's <i>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</i> and Wii's <i>Super Paper Mario</i> will be hitting the service on an unspecified future date.<br />
<br />
Also making an appearance among the games that have not yet been releasesd is the Genesis sequel to <i>Toejam & Earl</i>: <i>Toejam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron</i>.  It's reasonable to expect both titles will hit the Virtual Console service this coming Monday.
