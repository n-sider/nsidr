<p>After seeing Wii in action at this past E3 show, Take Two <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152588.html">is considering the console</a> for titles slated to hit in 2007 or 2008.</p>

<p>In a financial conference call, CEO Karl Winters addressed the possibility thusly: ""The reception this platform received at the E3 show, you know, is one that makes us take a real strong look at it.  And as we grow our sports business, there are opportunities with our sports games to extend them to the Wii system, particularly if you look at baseball where we have exclusive arrangement, as well as, you know, some of the other sports games, which would play extremely well on the Wii product, the nonlicensed league ones."</p>
