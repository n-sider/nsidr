<p><a href="http://www.intothepixel.com/index.php">Into the Pixel</a> is taking submissions for video game-related artwork until March 3.  Of course, to be accepted, this will require that you worked on a particular video game.  HAL Laboratory's Tomomi Minami and Tomoko Kitada won in 2005 for their <a href="http://www.intothepixel.com/preview.php?129&year=2005">Kirby-ful Color Oil Painting</a>.  The Into the Pixel exhibit hopes to give artists recognition for their work and will be on display during the Electronic Entertainment Expo from May 10 - 12.  Submissions will be judged by a selection of men and women from a variety of backgrounds in education, game development and art.</p>

<p>Speaking of art.  The following piece is something worth seeing.  An individual created a 700x10000 drawing entirely in Microsoft Paint using a Logitech laser mouse.  It's one of the neatest drawings I've seen in a while.  Seriously, <a href="http://www.ubersite.com/m/84167">go check it out</a>.</p>
