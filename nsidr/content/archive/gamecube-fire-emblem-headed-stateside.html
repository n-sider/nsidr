<P>N-Sider has learned that the GameCube version of Fire Emblem will in fact be released on western shores.  The current US release estimate places the game in February 2005.</P>

<P>Supposedly, the next GBA Fire Emblem will also be released in America in a similar timeframe.  The GBA game is a chronological sequel to the already released US version of Fire Emblem, but was actually the first of the two games to be released in Japan.</P>
