Although the engines have long since cooled, those who didn't 

participate in the Mario Kart Tournament are probably wondering, "What are the results?"  Well fancy that, we've managed to update the <a href="http://wifi.n-sider.com/tournament/standings.php">Tournament Central</a> with the anticipated standings of the 32 racers.  The top racers are as follows:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Taylor Yust (28)
<li>Kevin Caron (22)
<li>Robert Strutz (22)
<li>Adam Fletcher (16)
</ol>
Congrats to the winners as well to everyone who participated.  The smell of burnt rubber is no doubt still in your clothing.<br><br>
The tournament consisted of 32 players randomly chosen from around the United States and Canada.  Prizes for the top winners included a Game Boy Micro, GameCube games, Nintendo DS styluses, and more.  The tournament kicked off at 4:00PM EST on December 10 and was organized through IRC chatrooms by N-Sider staff. Aside from some unavoidable complications with Mario Kart's online matching system, the tournament was a success and everyone had an old-fashioned good time.<br><br>
Again, congratulations to the winners.
