<a name="wakeboarding"></a><div class="header">Wakeboarding</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating)<br />
<br />
Wakeboarding only has a single activity, though there are three courses labelled beginner, intermediate, and expert.  Your Mii trails a speedboat on a 'board, holding on to a rope.  Hold the Wii Remote NES-style and tilt it side-to-side to skim back and forth, and when you cross the boat's wake, you'll go up in the air.<br />
<br />
Thrust the Wii Remote upward when you hit the wake to make bigger jumps.  Tilt the Remote so that you land flat (much like landing for a turbo boost in <i>Excitebots</i>) and you'll score points depending on the height of your jump as well as gain more speed to pull off even higher jumps in a chain.  If you don't land straight, you'll sink into the water and lose all your momentum.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3933-3.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Huge Air: Score 100 points on a single jump.</li>
  <li>Bag of Tricks: Land seven or more different kinds of jumps on a single run. (What kind of jump you make depends on your speed and the length of your approach.)</li>
  <li>Smooth Landing: Land 10 jumps in a row properly.</li>
  <li>Master Carver: Score 1,000 points or more on Expert without hitting any obstacles.</li>
  <li>The Long Way Home: Before starting your match, do Free Cruising mode and take a trip all the way around Wuhu Island, landing 50 jumps along the way.</li>
  </ul><br />
<a name="frisbee"></a><div class="header">Frisbee</div><br />
Tossing a Frisbee is done one of two ways: Manual (hold B, and release it to release the disc) and Automatic (no buttons required).  I've had better luck with Manual.  Either way, you draw back over your shoulder, then swing the Remote in an arc to throw the disc.  Angling it up or down, varying the strength of your throw, and even tilting it all behave pretty much like you'd expect from a real-life Frisbee.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Frisbee Dog</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
Famously demonstrated in 2008 by Cammie Dunaway, in Frisbee Dog you stand in front of a playfield and toss your Frisbee at a mark where your dog expects to run to.  The immediate ring around the target scores you 100 points, the second ring out 50, and the final ring out 10.  The last five throws feature balloons that sometimes require a little angling of the Frisbee to pop them for 50 bonus points and still land on the mark.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3933-4.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Good Dog: Throw the Frisbee into the center of the target; the dog will jump up and grab it in the air.</li>
  <li>Balloon Animal: In the pre-game practice mode, pop all nine balloons in ten throws or less.  (The balloons reset after every ten throws.)</li>
  <li>A for Effort: Score 10 points on every throw; no more, no less.</li>
  <li>Perfect Target: Hit the center of the target area on all ten throws.</li>
  <li>Golden Arm: Throw a perfect round: 100 points on every throw and 50 bonus points for every balloon.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>A for Effort, Perfect Target, and Golden Arm are not available in team play.</i><br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Frisbee Golf</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
Play golf with your Frisbee on three, nine, or all eighteen of <i>Wii Sports Resort</i>'s golf holes.  For each throw, you'll be able to select from the Driver (averages 180 yards), the Midrange (90), or the Putter (30).  The "hole" in this case is actually a target; if you get your Frisbee into the shining cylinder projected from its boundaries, you've completed that hole.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3933-5.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Under Par: Finish any course (three, nine, or eighteen-hole) under par&mdash;a score of -1 or less.</li>
  <li>Lucky Skip: Frisbees can skip across water hazards; you'll get this stamp if yours land safely after doing so.</li>
  <li>On a Roll: <i>Roll</i> your Frisbee into the goal from outside the green.</li>
  <li>Hole in One: Pretty self-explanatory.</li>
  <li>Straight and Narrow: Play an eighteen-hole course without ever landing out of bounds or in the water.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>Under Par and Straight and Narrow are not available in team play.</i><br />
<br />
<a name="archery"></a><div class="header">Archery</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
You'll need to connect the Nunchuk for the single Archery mode, which you play by holding the Wii Remote vertically in your aiming hand, holding A, then holding Z on the Nunchuk to draw back your arrow&mdash;you can pull back the Nunchuk to draw your arrow more quickly, but it's not required.<br />
<br />
Take aim by angling the Wii Remote, and releasing Z to loose your arrow.  If you hold down Z too long, you'll start to lose your focus and will have to re-string your bow.  Releasing A at any time will let you start your shot over again.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3933-6.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
There are three levels of play: beginner, intermediate, and expert.  Each has its own four archery stages that you'll get three cracks at each.  There's also hidden targets in every level&mdash;though they don't seem to net you any better score than a bullseye would.<br />
<br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Bull Stampede: Hit a bullseye with all three shots in one stage, on any level. </li>
  <li>Sure Shot: Hit the target with all three shots across all four stages.</li>
  <li>Century Shot: Shoot 100 arrows into the target.</li>
  <li>A Secret to Everybody: Hit all the secret targets in every stage in every level.</li>
  <li>Sharpshooter: Score 10 points with every arrow across all four stages.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>Bull Stampede, Sure Shot, and Sharpshooter are not available in team play.</i><br />
