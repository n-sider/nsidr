You probably already know there's a lot to do in <i>Wii Sports Resort</i>.  But you probably haven't had anyone lay out the full list of activities for you.  Until now.<br />
<br />
As part of our preview coverage of the North American version of <i>Wii Sports Resort</i>, we compiled this guide, laying out each and every activity in the game as well as the stamps available in each one.  Today you'll get the first four sports and all their requisite activities, tomorrow four more, and the final four will be available on Thursday.<br />
<br />
By time you're finished reading the lot, you'll know all about what goes on at the <i>Resort</i>.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
<a name="swordplay"></a><div class="header">Swordplay</div><br />
All the Swordplay games use the same scheme.  You're supposed to keep both hands on the Wii Remote and swing your sword into your opponent when an opportunity arises&mdash;though with my huge hands, I found myself swinging with only my right hand quite often.  You can also do a lunge by thrusting the Remote forward.<br />
<br />
Holding B will put you into a defensive position, but that doesn't automatically mean you'll block everything; you'll need to position your sword so that it's roughly 90Â° in opposition to your opponent's strike.  When a strike is blocked, the striker will wobble briefly; this is your (or your opponent's) chance to retaliate.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Duel</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1 (vs. CPU) or 2 (simultaneous)<br />
<br />
You and your opponent stand atop a circular arena high above the water.  Hit them as many times as it takes to knock them out of the ring to win the round before the clock runs out.  There are three rounds, and if you win two, you take the match; but if three rounds have passed and there's not yet a winner, you'll go to sudden death mode.  The larger arena falls away and you and your opponent must now fight atop a much smaller circle.  Most rounds end quickly here.<br />

<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3933-1.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Cliff-Hanger: Draw the first three rounds and play sudden death.</li>
  <li>Straight to the Point: Push your opponent out of the ring with a lunge.</li>
  <li>Met Your Match: Draw three rounds and draw again in sudden death for a completely even match.</li>
  <li>One-Hit Wonder: Push your opponent out of the ring with a single strike.</li>
  <li>Last Mii Standing: Defeat the champion.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>All stamps are available in single-player mode only.</i><br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Speed Slice</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1 (vs. CPU) or 2 (simultaneous)<br />
<br />
Objects are tossed in front of you and your opponent, and a strike direction is shown.  Be the first to slice the object in the correct direction to win each round.  Pretty simple.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3933-7.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Slice and Dice: Win without missing (slicing the wrong way) or failing to slice within the time limit.</li>
  <li>Slicing Machine: Slice at least one of each of the 18 types of objects.  You'll need to play several rounds to get them all.</li>
  <li>Psychic Slice: Slice an item correctly before it lands.</li>
  <li>Double Time: Slice the clock when the two digits are the same, e.g. 8.8, 7.7, 6.6, etc.</li>
  <li>A Cut Above: Defeat the champion.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>All stamps are available in single-player only.</i><br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Showdown</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1<br />
<br />
Fight your way through several waves of Miis to the end of each of ten stages (sounds like there's a "final" stage, but I haven't seen it just yet... the upper levels can get quite challenging!)  You can take two hits and still fight on&mdash;but the third will end your adventure.  Many go down with one hit, but as you progress in levels, there'll be more that take multiple hits and put up a fight.  In true Jackie Chan style, even though you may be swarmed by Miis, only one will engage you at a time.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3933-2.jpg" width="444" height="249" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Not a Scratch: Clear any stage without taking a hit.</li>
  <li>Sword Fighter: Clear the first 10 stages.</li>
  <li>Perfect 10: Clear stage 10 without taking a hit.</li>
  <li>Swordmaster: Fight through the final Showdown stage.</li>
  <li>Untouchable: Fight through the final stage without taking a hit.</li>
  </ul>
