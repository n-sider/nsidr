Sega Nerds recently <a href="http://www.seganerds.com/2007/06/11/interview-paul-mottram-zoe-mode-senior-producer">interviewed</a> ZoÃ« Mode's senior producer Paul Mottram about recently-released PSP game <i>Crush</i>&mdash;a platform-puzzler with a twist.<br />
<br />
Crush requires the player to collect blue spheres to exit the level and red spheres or jigsaw puzzle pieces for unlockables. Some of the items are very obviously out of reach, so in order to make them reachable, the player can adjust the camera angle to one of three different angles and "crush" the level, removing the 3D aspect from that particular angle. So, for example, if a blue orb is atop a tall pillar, the player could change the camera angle to a top-down view, crush the level, and pick up the sphere.<br />
<br />
This unique game also comes packed with a relatively deep story&mdash;something not usually seen in puzzle games. Players control Danny, a man hospitalized for insomnia. Danny is troubled by his past and seeks out Dr. Reuben, considered a mad scientist by some, who claims to have the ability to cure Danny of his insomnia. Enter C.R.U.S.H. (Cognitive Regression Utilizing pSychiatric Heuristics), Dr. Reuben's creation that will supposedly help Danny.<br />
<br />
During the interview, Mottram expressed possible interest in bringing Crush to DS, Wii, and PS2, and promised that if it happened, ZoÃ« Mode would work to make each version take full advantage of its respective platform. He also said that if any other version was to be released, he would like for there to be an in-game level editor. ZoÃ« Mode already had one working but didn't have the time to implement it for the final product.<br />
<br />
At the moment, this is nothing more than a developer's wish to bring the game to a wider audience. Nothing official has been announced, but we will keep listening.
