<p>Gamasutra has <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9526">word from a recent retailer meeting</a> Nintendo held in Japan to discuss all things DS.</p>

<p>Nintendo DS is, as it was when we last left it, still huge in Japan.  <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876">New Super Mario Bros.</a></cite> was just released there on May 25, and Nintendo shipped 900,000 copies in the first four days it was on shelves.  (Retailers sold 480,000 of those copies on the first day.)  In addition &mdash; again, in Japan alone &mdash; <cite>Tetris DS</cite> has shipped 800,000 since its fairly recent release, and <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a></cite> has shipped over 3 million copies.</p>

<p>At the event, Nintendo confirmed some new titles for its Touch Generations line as well.  <cite>Talking Cooking Navi</cite>, a voice-activated interactive cookbook, and <cite>Common Sense Training for Adults</cite> will both hit the system soon.  Third-parties are also coming to the table with Red Entertainment's <cite>Project Hacker</cite>, a sequel to Bandai Namco's <cite>Tamagotchi</cite>, and Sega's <cite>Love and Berry DS Collection</cite>, which comes with a card reader.</p>
