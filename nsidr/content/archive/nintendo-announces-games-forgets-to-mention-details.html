It's been rumored for awhile that Monster Games, makers of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=1044&view=review">phenomenally awesome</a> arcade racer <i>Excite Truck</i>, have been at work for a new title for Nintendo.  Like all rumors, this one sounds plausible, but is impossible to verify.<br />
<br />
Today, Nintendo made a related announcement, and this is <i>still</i> a rumor.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3844-1.png" width="129" height="246" class="image_nostyle" /></div>Yes, it's true that among other titles, they've announced a curious title called <i>Excitebots: Trick Racing</i> (releasing April 20), which sounds sort of like <i>Excite Truck</i> and is in fact a sequel, but we don't know if Monster is at the helm.  We don't even know <i>what it looks like</i>; no screens have been released.  <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/957/957527p1.html">Not even IGN</a> really has a clue at this point.<br />
<br />
Nintendo's also decided to bring some game in the oft-desired Starfy series to America as <i>The Legendary Starfy</i> on June 8.  Which game is it?  Well, it's for DS, it could be <i>Densetsu no Starfy 4</i>, but again... we don't know.  We're also getting <i>Personal Trainer: Walking</i> on May 25, which is almost certainly a localization of the walking game that's been shipped in Japan for some time, only we get two pedometers in the box instead of one.  A smattering of dates have come out for games like the bongo-less Wii remake of <i>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</i> as well (May 4) and the new Wii <i>Punch-Out!!</i> (May 18).<br />
<br />
We do know at least one thing, though.  Nintendo of America's immediate release plans are starting, little-by-little, to look at least a little more healthy.  Perhaps we may even end the year in better shape than we did last, with titles denied left and right.  We can hope, right?
