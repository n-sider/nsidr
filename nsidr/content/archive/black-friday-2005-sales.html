<p>Crazy enough to be caught in retail outlets the day after Thanksgiving?  If you're in the States, you may be interested in 4 color rebellion's compilation of <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2005/11/23/black-friday-games-sales/">Black Friday Game Sales</a>.</p>

<p>Of particular note is several retailers offering <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=23">Game Boy Advance SP</a> units for around $50.  In Wal-Mart's case, at least, this sale is limited to the older front-lit models only and doesn't extend to the new, brighter backlit models, so watch what you pick up off the shelf.</p>

<p>Other deals of interest include Nintendo DS juggernauts <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><i>Nintendogs</i></a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a> for slightly reduced prices, as well as numerous other titles for all current Nintendo platforms.  Nothing terribly outstanding, but you take what you can get, eh?</p>
