<p>N-Sider reader Daniel Austin responds to yesterday's 'reader response' <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2425">from Zak</a>.  He takes a different position on the recent news.</p>

<p><b>Daniel Austin says,</b><br>
I'm not happy with the launch price being $250 either. Honestly, I would have been fine with that price until the VP of EA suggested that the price might be $170 in Japan. After that, there was no turning back from the thoughts of Nintendo coming in low to establish a strong non-gamer presence. Of course, for the hardcore gamers, this was a moment for rejoicing. Thinking that we could have a more advanced system, a revolutionary control device and all the bells and whistles for such a great price was mind-blowing. So yes, I'm disappointed in the launch price. I hope that Nintendo hears the complaints of its loyal fans (I've NEVER owned a system without a Nintendo brand on it) and drops the price before launch. That would be revolutionary in itself.</p>

<p>I will have to say though that he can't compare the prices of Nintendo's system to the other overpriced manufacturers. He mentions adding extra controllers to Nintendo's system for multiplayer games and that it would bring the price close to the competition, but if you wanted to play multiplayer games on the other systems, you'd have to do the same thing. And that would increase the total price of the other systems. Same thing with having to buy additional games. I'm not happy that Wii sports is included as the only option. I would rather pay $250 and be able to pick my own launch title. THAT would be revolutionary.</p>

<p>I'm excited that I can purchase extra controllers ($60 IS high to me, but there is a LOT of technology in those controllers) and get my non-gaming family involved in something I think they will actually enjoy. A Xbox 360 wireless controller is $40-$50, so is $60 really that much extra? For a motion sensing controller that can be directed to any point on the screen AND a motion sensing nunchuck attachment?</p>

<p>I think if you consider the amount of new technologies in this system, it's begins to sound pretty reasonable.</p>
