<p>By now, you've probably seen the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1746">side-by-side shots</a> showing the DS Lite and the classic model and how much brighter the Lite is, so this is probably old news to you.  Still, independent observation is worth far more than models on display at a show:</p>

<p>This shot, and <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/03/02/ultimate-comparison-pics/">other comparison pictures</a>, were taken by 4ColorRebellion reader CTU Kyoto, who was reportedly lucky enough to get hold of a Lite despite the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1800">Japanese sell-out</a>.  Very nice-looking indeed.</p>
