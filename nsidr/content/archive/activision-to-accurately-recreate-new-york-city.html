Activision said its upcoming game <i>True Crime: New York City</i> will feature an accurate depiction of New York City. Scheduled to release this fall on the Nintendo GameCube, <i>True Crime: New York City</i> is said to contain GPS-accurate streets, complete with subways, hundreds of interiors, internationally recognized landmarks and real neighborhoods such as Harlem, Chinatown and Times Square.<br>

In the game, players take the role of a former gang member turned cop named Marcus Reed who must fight the city's crime.  "Players will experience all the sights and sounds of New York, complete with the energy and architecture authentic to the city's diverse neighborhoods, the voices and likenesses of real New Yorkers, and the cacophony of ambient traffic and bustling noises unique to the city," said Activision in a press release.  "The game also includes character concentrations specific to each neighborhood.   For example, the player will find a plethora of tourists amidst the lights and large buildings of Times Square, but predominantly locals near the brownstones of Harlem."
