<p>Nintendo of America has announced that a Pokemon RPG, tentatively titled <i>Pokemon XD</i> will be coming to the Nintendo GameCube later this year.</p>

<p><i>"Pokemon XD is a brand new Pokemon game for GameCube," explained <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</a> in an interview with IGNCube.com.  "It's a true RPG Pokemon. It's isn't a sequel to Collosseum. It's a brand new build. A brand new game that really plays off the RPG aspects. So think of it this way. If you loved Ruby and Sapphire, you're going to love Pokemon XD for GameCube."</i></p>

<p>Screens and more information on the title will likely arrive closer to the May Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>
