<p>Astaro Corporation announced today that it will be providing filtering technology for the Nintendo DS Browser software to guard users against inappropriate content.</p>

<p>The technology is called Astaro Parental Control, and will allow parents to set passwords required to use the Nintendo DS Browser.  Web requests will be pushed through a proxy service maintained by Astaro that can block a page based on 17 different criteria including "nudity", "illegal drugs", and "weapons".  Uncategorized sites are reviewed within 48 hours.</p>

<p>In Japan, where the browser software is already released, I-Filter <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2251">provides a similar service</a>.  I-Filter's service comes with a fee attached.</p>

<p>Nintendo and Astaro will be offering this service free with the Nintendo DS Browser, which hits Europe on October 6.  Nintendo has not made public any plans to release the browser software in America.</p>
