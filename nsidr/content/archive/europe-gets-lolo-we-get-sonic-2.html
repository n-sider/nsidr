The Virtual Console service on the Wii Shop Channel has been updated both here and across the Atlantic, and both territories are now home to several new classic re-releases.<br />
<br />
For Europe, as of last Friday, we have the following releases, making a total of 96 (we're expecting a "<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2829">100th release</a>" press release any day now):<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Balloon Fight</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Adventures of Lolo</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Dead Moon</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
And having gone live at 9 a.m. Pacific time this morning, these titles are now available on the North American Virtual Console:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Lode Runner</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</i> (Sega Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Golden Axe II</i> (Sega Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
Again, all these titles are available now, so if you're interested in the ones in your territory, and have the Wii Points to spend, head on over and grab one.
