<p>This week's Japanese Famitsu magazine has a new rumor nestled into its rumor section that brings excitement to many old-school Sega fans.  According to the magazine, Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed Revolution will be receiving an action game in which you fly a clown-like magician through the sky. Furthermore, the game will be developed by a game creator who has recently gone independent.</p>

<p>Few games fit this description other than Sega's NiGHTS Into Dreams originally released for its Sega Saturn console in 1996.  Furthermore, recent word is that Sega's Sonic Team director Yuji Naka recently departed the studio to create a new development team.  The team however, is said to retain support from Sega.  Sega has made no comment on this information.</p>

<p>NiGHTS Into Dreams was considerably innovative for its time.  In 1996, it brought players into a dream-like world where an analogue joypad was used to fly around 3D environments.  Naka has been concerned about creating a sequel to the game since it would have a lot to live up to.  In fact, the December 2002 issue of the Official Dreamcast magazine saw Naka saying, "I know a lot of people love it and want us to make a sequel, but for us it's a really important game. Like the way Spielberg likes E.T. so much he won't remake it, I don't want to make another NiGHTS."

<p>More recently however, including an interview in the November 2003 edition of Edge, Naka revealed he would like to continue the franchise.  "I see NiGHTS as a license. When dealing with such a license from the past it is quite a lot of work, but I would like to use NiGHTS to reinforce Sega's identity, yes."</p>

<p>If true, look to the Electronic Entertainment Expo beginning May 9 for more information.</p>
