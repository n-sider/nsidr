Yesterday, Epicenter Studios announced a game currently in development exclusively for Wii: <i>Real Heroes: Firefighter</i>.<br />
<br />
In Real Heroes, players take control of a rookie firefighter, only recently assigned to a busy metropolitan area. Players will save people by using the Wii remote to aim the fire hose, hack down doors with an axe, and pry open wrecked cars with the Jaws of Life.<br />
<br />
Epicenter has developed a "Thinking Fire" technology that will not only spread to structures, victims, and firefighters, but also cause changes to the environment. Players will need to keep on their toes in order to beat the fire and save the victims. No two scenarios will play out the same way.<br />
<br />
Real Heroes: Firefighter is being developed for a holiday 2008 release.
