Courtesy of the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu and its titular western provider neo2046 comes the first look at <i>Soul Calibur Legends</i>, an action-adventure interpretation of Namco's storied Soul Calibur franchise being developed exclusively for the Wii.<br />

The images feature series veterans Siegfried and Taki battling against various goons in a 3D setting, with one particular image pitting Siegfried against returning villain Astaroth.  Oddly the title seems not to exceed&mdash;or even meet&mdash;the graphical finesse of <i>Soul Calibur II</i> on the GameCube, but that could easily be attributed to a development cycle currently in its infancy.<br />
<br />
We'll have more on Soul Calibur Legends, particularly if the second half of this scan ever shows up, as it breaks.
