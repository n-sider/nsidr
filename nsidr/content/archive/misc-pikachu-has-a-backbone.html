<p>Artist Michael Paulus has recently put up for display a collection of skeletal structures of various cartoon and animated characters from popular culture over the last few decades. Ranging from Power Puff girls to the Flintstones, Paulus shows just what our favourite creatures and characters would look like if they were in fact, real beings with real skeletons.</p>
<p> You can check out his character skeletons gallery <a href="http://michaelpaulus.com/gallery/character-Skeletons">here</a>, or view all of his works <a href="http://michaelpaulus.com/gallery/albums.php">here</a>.</p>
