<p>On the occasion of his 60th birthday today, Nintendo has sent President of the United States George W. Bush a Touch Generations-branded bag containing a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> and a copy of brain-training title <cite>Brain Age</cite>.  Kotaku has <A href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/president-bush/nintendo-gifts-ds-lite-to-president-bush-185282.php">  a picture of the bag and the text of the letter</a> as well as plenty of Bush jokes in the comments section.</p>

<p>Nintendo has not made any announcements that they plan to give free gaming systems and/or games to any non-heads-of-state turning 60 today.</p>
