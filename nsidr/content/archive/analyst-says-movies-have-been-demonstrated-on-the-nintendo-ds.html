<p>According to CNNMoney, in an analyst report issued Wednesday, March 3, 2004, P.J. McNealy of American Technology Research said a two-hour movie on a 128 MB flash cartridge was demonstrated on Nintendo's upcoming dual-screened handheld, the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>McNealy also said that Nintendo hopes to launch the DS with an initial catalog of a dozen games, with prices ranging from $20 to $30 per title.</p>

<p>Nintendo responded to CNN's query about the validity of McNealy's statements saying the company would not comment on rumors or speculation.</p> 

<p>At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, AM3 Inc. announced it would create a dedicated adapter for the <i>Game Boy Advance</i> and would release SmartMedia memory cards that would provide full motion video play on the Game Boy Advance handheld.</p>

<p>Using special image compression technology, AM3 said SmartMedia cards would provide full-motion video replay of up to 24 minutes on a 32MB SmartMedia card without any additional software.  Below is our original news report describing the announcement in more detail from the E3 2003 show floor.</p>

<blockquote><i><p>Memory cards in a "pre-recorded" format will be available for sale - providing content such as TV animation, music, video, digital comic books, educational video, and karaoke.  Consumers can download new content onto blank SmartMedia cards at convenience store kiosks via the Internet.  The software is licensed by Nintendo for sale in Japan.</p>

<p>4 Kids Entertainment is providing its own "video paks" to use with the system that will allow 40 minutes of full motion video or animation.  The company's Video Paks will provide such children's shows as Pokemon, Kirby, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  4 Kids will release its product quarter four, 2003.</p></i></blockquote>

<p>It is not known if AM3 is involved with the supposed Nintendo DS demonstration referred to by American Technology Research analyst P.J. McNealy.</p>
