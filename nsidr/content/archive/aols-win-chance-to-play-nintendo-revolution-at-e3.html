<p>Nintendo has partnered with AOL Games to offer one person the prize of attending the May 9 Electronic Entertainment Expo where the Nintendo Revolution will be showcased for the first time.  The advertisement reads, "You could be the first fan to play Nintendo's upcoming gaming system codenamed Revolution.  Play in front of thousands at Nintendo's exclusive media event..."  This confirms that Nintendo will showcase the Nintendo Revolution in playable form at its press conference on May 9, a day before the E3 Expo opens its doors.</p>

<p>The winner will have the opportunity to spend 3-days and 2-nights in Los Angeles for E3 and also receive a Nintendo DS portable and copy of New Super Mario Bros.  If you're at least 18 years of age, you can enter <a href="http://videogames.aol.com/sweepstakes">here</a>. The winner will be announced tomorrow.  Good luck.  Even if you don't win, stick to N-Sider as we'll report live from the event.</p>
