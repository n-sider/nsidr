<p>Despite rumors circulating the internet, Nintendo has not finalized plans for the distribution of classic titles on the Nintendo Revolution.</p>

<p>"For Revolution and accessing older games, we haven't finalized how we will structure it yet," said Perrin Kaplan Nintendo of America's Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs to PlanetGameCube.com.  "It is possible that players will enjoy these games without a charge from Nintendo, or there may be some pay structure for accessing the actual product. We haven't finalized it yet. Our goal is to make it as easy and inexpensive as possible, which could be free."</p>
