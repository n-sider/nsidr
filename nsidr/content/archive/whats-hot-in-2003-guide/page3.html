<H3>What's <i>HOT</i> in 2003!!! - PAL Coverage.</H3>



<P>So, another year has passed, and another year full of gaming goodness to look forward to.  This is just a selection of what we think will be the big things to hit this year for PAL gamers.



<P>While we might get things later than everyone else in the world, in some ways it's a blessing in disguise.  Just take a look at what 2003 will offer in the one year, Metroid Prime, Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire, Game Boy Advance SP, Resident Evil Zero.  The list goes on, and that's for the one year alone.  In that sense, sometimes PAL gamers have it better!



<P>But anyway, on with the show...

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mortalkombat-front.jpg" align=left><B>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance<BR></b>February 14th (Acclaim)



<P><I>Mortal Kombat</i> comes back to a home Nintendo system with a new 3D update of the well known fighting gore-fest.  Featuring new 3D graphics, backgrounds and animations, and a huge cast of fantastical characters to fight with, <I>Deadly Alliance</i> is one the "Kombat" fans won't want to miss out on.

<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="mar">March</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/RE0box.jpg" align=right><B>Resident Evil Zero</b><BR>

March 14th (THQ)



<P>The first <b>brand new</b> edition of the <I>Resident Evil</i> series to hit the GameCube is the prequel to <I>Resident Evil</I>.  Combined with the gorgeous graphics and the familiar sense of terror that is the hallmark of the <i>Resident Evil</i> franchise; is the new twist in the gameplay.  



<P><I>Resident Evil Zero</i> introduces the ability to play as two characters at once, and will change the way people play <I>Resident Evil</i> games.  <i>Resident Evil Zero</i> is one to look forward to.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03gbasp-1.jpg" align=left><B>Game Boy Advance SP</b><BR>

March 28th (Nintendo)



<P>A special edition of the mega-successful Game Boy Advance.  This new version brings a sleek and sexy new design, switchable front-lit screen, rechargeable lithium battery, and a new multi-out port.  



<P>All of the perceived flaws in the original Game Boy Advance hardware have been addressed in this new version.  <b><i>Definitely</b></i> one to watch out for.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/smbjr-front.jpg" align=right height=108 width=108><B>Super Monkey Ball Jr.</b><BR>

March, 2003



<P><I>Super Monkey Ball</i> on the GameCube is indeed a spectacular game, with a superb analogue control system, plenty of levels and play modes.  Surprisingly, that millimetre-perfect control system has been translated to the digital controls of the Game Boy Advance without much of a hint in loss of accuracy.  All of the levels and play modes have been shrunk down into portable form for the GBA players out there.  Great single and multi-player fun.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/smb-boxart.jpg" align=left height=152 width=108><B>Super Monkey Ball 2</b><BR>

March, 2003



<P>Featuring the original mini-games from the first game with a few twists, along with some all-new mini-games, <I>Super Monkey Ball 2</i> is a class act.



<P>The main game has benefited from the addition of a story mode, as well as many new levels to once again test your dexterity with a control stick, your patience, and your brain cells to figure out the solution to the multitude of mazes you encounter.



<P>A multiplayer favourite, this will no doubt find plenty of fans.



<P><HR>



<h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="apr">April</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mprime-front.jpg" align=right><B>Metroid Prime</b><BR>

April 3rd (Nintendo)



<P>One of the <b><I>big</i></b> releases for the year.  PAL gamers will get to experience what is justifiably considered GameCube's finest hour.  Everything from the superb and brave translation into the third dimension, to the mind-blowing graphics, the massive bosses, the dazzling areas to explore, and finally the immense gameplay involved.  This will surely be a winner.  



<P>Definitely the one to start saving for, if you haven't done so already.  It is, quite simply, breathtaking.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03pokemon.jpg" align=left><B>Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire</b><BR>

April 3rd (Nintendo)



<P>Brand new Game Boy Advance adventures of the phenomenally successful and uber-popular <i>Pokemon</i> series, these new versions bring <i>Pokemon</i> kicking and screaming into the hottest piece of portable gaming hardware, the Game Boy Advance.  



<P>Featuring a massive quest, with all-new monsters to catch, and characters to meet and challenge, <i>Ruby</i> and <i>Sapphire</i> should remind the world how addictive it can be to "catch 'em all".



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03goldensun2.jpg" align=right><B>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</b><BR>

April 18th (Nintendo)



<P>Sequel to the Camelot-developed original, <I>The Lost Age</i> features another huge RPG adventure, with a whole host of spells to cast, magic to learn, characters to play as and talk to, and enemies and bosses to fight.  RPG fans will lap this up.



<P><HR>



<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="may">May</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/resevil2.jpg" align=left><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/resevil3.jpg" align=left><B>Resident Evil 2</b> and <B>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</b><BR>

May 9th, 2003 (THQ)



<P>Straight ports of these two games.  While not featuring updated graphics similar to the original <I>Resident Evil</i>, these are nevertheless welcome on the GameCube to complete the series.  Possibly only for fans though.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/burnout2-front.jpg" align=right><B>Burnout 2: Point of Impact</b><BR>

May (Acclaim)



<P>Arcade racing never felt so good.  This sequel features new play modes and even faster racing.  Careering around the roads like a crazy drunk driver, all in the name of winning, coupled with a fantastic sensation of speed, <i>Burnout 2</i> is as good as it gets.  The new Crash mode brings new meaning to "multi car pile-up", and proves to be ever so addictive.



<P>Looking for the perfect not-so-serious racing game? Look no further than <i>Burnout 2: Point of Impact.</i>



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03splintercell.jpg" align=left><B>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (GCN)</b><BR>

May 22nd, 2003 (UbiSoft)



<P>The acclaimed "espionage" game hits the GameCube after a successful stint on the Xbox where it received various awards including AIAS Console Game of the Year 2002.  



<P>Set to feature extra features not present in the original version, and should do well on the Cube.  Start saving to get some spy action in.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/zelda.jpg" align=right><B>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</b><BR>

May (Nintendo)



<P>A brave new direction for one of the most cherished franchises in videogame history, <I>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> should once again entrance gamers with absorbing gameplay, sumptuous music and sound effects, and convince gamers of the quality of cel-shaded graphics.



<P>This is probably the most highly anticipated Nintendo release for the year, and should serve to remind players of what's most important in videogames, the gameplay.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/splintercellgba-front.jpg" align=left height=108 width=108><B>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (GBA)</b><BR>

May 22nd, 2003 (UbiSoft)



<P>For the Game Boy Advance, not much is known of this 2D iteration of <i>Splinter Cell.</i>  However, it should be able to capture the essence of its big brother and thrill players with various missions to play through.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/skies.jpg" align=right><b>Skies of Arcadia Legends</b><BR>

May, 2003



<P>One of the superb Sega RPG's from the Dreamcast finds a new home on the GameCube.  Unlike other adventure games, <i>Skies of Arcadia Legends</i> is heavily reliant on its story to further the gameplay, so fans of a good old yarn will find solace with this title.



<P>Everyone looking for a more-than decent RPG adventure need look no further than this.



<P><HR>



<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="jun">June</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03gbaplayer-1.jpg" align=left><B>Game Boy Player</b><BR>

TBA Likely June, 2003 (Nintendo)



<P>The ability to play all Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games, in the comfort of your living room, using the fabulous GameCube controller.  What more could you ask for?



<P>This is the answer to many a GBA player's prayers, and Nintendo have delivered in fine style.  Will come in all suitable colours of GameCube.  Jet Black, Indigo, Spice Orange, and Platinum.  The latter two for NTSC territories.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03warioworld.jpg" align=right><B>Wario World</b><BR>

June (Nintendo)



<P>Not much is known, but the pedigree behind it suggests that this could be a winner.  Developed by Treasure and featuring Mario's devilish alter-ego, GameCube will play host to more jewel collecting, enemy bashing, Wario-morphing platform hopping fun.



<P><HR>



<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="jul">July</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03advancewars2.jpg" align=left><B>Advance Wars 2</b><BR>

July, 2003 (Nintendo)



<P>The original <i>Advance Wars</i> is still considered by many to be the finest game on the Gameboy Advance, and one of the best games on any system.  The sequel has a lot to live up to, but when Nintendo is handling the project, high expectations should easily be met.



<P>Expect more CO's, more play modes, more of everything...plus other secret goodies that can only make <i>Advance Wars 2</i> a must-own title when it's unleashed.



<P><HR>



<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="aug">August</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/afl2004.jpg" align=right><B>AFL Live 2004</b><BR>

August, 2003 (Acclaim)



<P>After the disappointment that was the cancellation of last year's version, <i>"2004"</i> should be a rocking game as well as a relief to Australian Cubers.  New stats, new players, updated gameplay mechanics, and the promise of more game modes should make this into a great "footy" game.  It should make it out around the time of the AFL finals too, to hopefully maximise exposure and sales.



<P><HR>



<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="oct">October</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03awonderfullife.jpg" align=left><B>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</b><BR>

October, 2003 (UbiSoft)



<P>Fans of <i>Harvest Moon</i> are eagerly awaiting this GameCube sequel.  Non-fans need to wake up and discover what <i>Harvest Moon</i> is all about.



<P><i>"A Wonderful Life"</i> should indeed help us game-players lead a wonderful life with all its gameplay elements.  The thought of living a life, working, eating, sleeping, breathing on the GameCube should be great fun.



<P><HR>



<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><A name="tba">TBA (To Be Advised)</a></font></h2>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03mariokart-1.jpg" align=right><B>Mario Kart GC</b><BR>

TBA (Nintendo)



<P>Update to the much loved <I>Mario Kart</i> series, this is another highly anticipated GameCube release.  While we still don't know much about it, there's huge potential for a supreme example of Nintendo quality.



<P>Rumours persist that <i>Mario Kart</i> will include an online mode, and should such a feature be included, <I>Mario Kart GC</i> could well become a jewel in GameCube's crown.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03mariotennis.jpg" align=left><B>Mario Tennis GC</b><BR>

TBA (Nintendo)



<P><i>Mario Tennis</i> on the Nintendo 64 is considered by many to be the definitive electronic version of the real-world sport, and who could argue with its myriad of shots to play, its substantial cast each with various abilities to suit different players, and its sheer playability?



<P>This latest GameCube iteration will boast all that and more besides, potentially with features that will reinforce its standing as one of, if not the, best Tennis games out there.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03mariogolf.jpg" align=right><B>Mario Golf GC</b><BR>

TBA (Nintendo)



<P>Sequel to the wonderful Nintendo 64 game, <I>Mario Golf GC</i> should give us more of the golfing fun we all had, and all want to experience again.  More courses, more tournaments, and maybe more surprises are in store.



<P>One likely change will be the shift from a power bar, to the use of the analog stick to swing the clubs.  This shift has been well received in other golf games, and would be more than welcome on this version as it represents a more natural way to control the in-game golf club.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03sc2.jpg" align=right><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/sc2.jpg" align=left><b>Soul Calibur II</b><BR>

TBA 2003



<P>Sequel to the legendary Dreamcast (and Arcade) fighter, with the added mouth-watering prospect of controlling Link (of <i>Zelda</i> fame), this should be a show stopper.  Expect amazing graphics, deep gameplay, fluid combo's and plenty of characters.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/PSO-front.jpg" align=right><B>Phantasy Star Online (Episode 1 + 2)</b><BR>

TBA 2003



<P>Originally appearing on the short-but-sweet Dreamcast, <I>Phantasy Star Online I+II</i> marks the first entry into online gaming for GameCube.  Judging by the hordes of <i>Phantasy Star Online</i> tribes and players in the world, GameCube players will have no shortage of people to play with and against.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03f-zero-1.jpg" align=left><B>F-Zero GC (GCN)</b><BR>

TBA (Nintendo)



<P>In conjunction with Sega Amusement Vision (for the arcade version), this is one on most people's "most wanted" lists.  A sequel to the impressive futuristic racing game series, this will boast <i>F-Zero's</i> unique vehicles and handling dynamics, as well as the now-customary 30-40 racers to race against.



<P>Along with jaw-dropping graphics, should the arcade version <i>(F-Zero AC)</i> make it out in PAL territories (e.g. Europe and Australia), then the two versions of <i>F-Zero</i> should incorporate innovative arcade-to-home-and-back gameplay possibilities.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh031080avalanche-1.jpg" align=right><B>1080: Avalanche</b><BR>

TBA (Nintendo)



<P>Sequel to the enormously playable N64 original, this should (at the very least) pick up right where the original left off.  Expect to see plenty of characters to choose, plenty of tricks to test your joypad dexterity, a ton of tracks (or courses) and game modes, and definitely some fantastic graphics.  From the team that brought you the incredible water effects of Wave Race: Blue Storm.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ACboxart.jpg" align=left height=152 width=108><B>Animal Crossing</b><BR>

TBA Unlikely (Nintendo)



<P>Quite possibly, <i><b>THE</b></i> most unique game to ever be released on any format, <i>Animal Crossing</i> is a game that does not fit into any established genre.  It's a game to be felt and lived, as well as played.  And it's one game that just cannot be explained with mere words, it must be experienced.



<P>While it's listed on Nintendo Australia's website, we still find it hard to believe that this will indeed be converted to PAL territories, but should this actually make it out in PAL format, at all costs it should not be missed.



<P><HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/thesims-front.jpg" align=right><B>The Sims</b><BR>

TBA (Electronic Arts)



<P>The most popular PC game of all-time finds a new home on the Nintendo GameCube.  Live a virtual life in the comfort of your TV.  Eat, sleep, work, breathe, garden, dance, shower...do it all.  On the GameCube.  This year.



<P><HR>



<P><h2><font color="#3399FF"><a name="other">Honourable Mentions</a></font></h2>



<p>Other Notable (Possible) 2003 releases (keep your eye on these titles as they all have huge potential):<br>

<P><HR>



<P><I>While there are bound to be surprise announcements and things that we may have missed, what's been talked about here should provide us all with some seriously good game time.  It's not often that there are years with new versions of both Metroid and Zelda to play through, not to mention the rest of the Resident Evil games to play.  On the portable front, there's always Pokemon to chew through.  



<P>And that's still not considering the great games that might seemingly come out of nowhere.  Whatever happens, 2003 is shaping up to be a monster year for Nintendo.



<P>Finally, for a sample of some games that will most likely hit our shelves next year, take a gander at the NTSC section of this feature.</i>
