<h3>What's HOT in 2003!!! - NTSC Coverage</h3>

<p>When we decided to create an article of short previews for the most promising titles coming out for the GameCube and Game Boy Advance this year we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. The sheer volume of quality games we anticipate in the next year or so made it prudent for N-Sider to breakdown the releases by month. Without further adieu, here is the NTSC edition of what is hot in 2003! 



<P><I>NB: Release Dates are subject to change without notice. Also, for reference, "TBA" stands for "To Be Announced" and "Q3" stands for "Quarter 3" (or 3rd Quarter) of the year. </i>

<p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03re2.jpg" align=left><b><I>Resident Evil 2</I></b><br>

GameCube - Capcom - January 15, 2003

<p>A few months after the mansion incident, Raccoon City has been infested with zombies. Play as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield as he/she tries to escape the wrath of a whole new virus. No, this isnt a new <I>Resident Evil</I> game, and it hasnt been reworked like the original remake. Its release on the GameCube is for those who enjoyed <I>Resident Evil</I> and <I>Resident Evil Zero</I> but never had the opportunity to play the originals on Playstation or Dreamcast. If youve become a fan of the series and dont own the originals, this is definitely a game you should pick up. Curiously, earlier last year Capcom announced that both <I>RE 2</I> and <I>RE 3</I> would retail for around 20 dollars, but on release have been marked up to $40. If you own a Playstation or Dreamcast (since they are unaltered versions), pick them up used for around 10 bucks.

GameCube - Capcom - January 15, 2003

<p>Jill Valentine, after surviving the mansion, is trapped in Raccoon City. Jill must fight her was through Raccoon City while being chased by a new Nemesis. Like <I>Resident Evil 2</I>, <I>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</I> is an unimproved port from earlier versions of the game.

GameCube - Sega - January 28, 2003

<p>Finally, a real RPG is coming to the GameCube. You play as a young air pirate named Vyse. During a standard raid, Vyse rescues a mysterious prisoner named Fina, who leads him on an adventure he never imagined. This is a story intensive RPG, which was one of the best on the Dreamcast. Although this is a port of the original <I>Skies of Arcadia</I>, there are some extra features such as an enhanced story and an improved battle engine.

GameCube - Ubi Soft - February 11, 2003

<p>The hit Xbox tactical shooter is finally being released on GameCube. The year is 2008, and you play as a member of an elite Green Beret squad, Ghost, which is sent to Eastern Europe to control a war erupting on Russian boarders. This is one of the most realistic squad simulators ever produced, including real life physics for both characters and weapons. Unfortunately, the GCN version will not feature any online play, so well have to see how this multiplayer friendly game translates to the GCN.

GameCube & GBA  Ubi Soft  March 04, 2003

<p>The bizarre world of <I>Rayman</I> is making its triumphant return to consoles this year in <I>Rayman 3</I>. In the game, Raymans friendly sidekick Globox accidently swallows the Lord of the Dark Lums. So the legless wonder must face the Hoodlums, an evil army bent on recovering their leader from Globox and overtaking the land, and find a cure for Globox as well. The game features numerous enhancements in gameplay, music, and style. Using the GCN/GBA linkup cable, players will gain access to a multiplayer game and unlock exclusive content.

<p>Since its Playstation debut in the mid 1990s, the Rayman series has continually displayed a level of quality of gameplay, artistic style, and pure fun (only counting the main games in the series) unmatched by most series out there. With a development time eclipsing four years now, our expectations for <I>Hoodlum Havoc</I> are enormous. Ubi Soft is well aware of this and if the past is any assessment, <I>Rayman 3</I> will definitely be worth the price of admission.

<p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03pokemon.jpg" align=right><b><I>Pokmon Ruby / Sapphire</I></b><br>

GBA  Nintendo  March 17, 2003

<p><I>Pokmon Ruby</I> and <I>Pokmon Sapphire</I> take place in an all-new region known as Hoenn. The single player aspect of the games will be very reminiscent of previous installments with a focus on battling wild Pokmon and becoming the number one trainer in the land of Hoenn. Aside from the predictable improvements in graphics and increase in the number of Pokmon available to collect, Ruby and Sapphire do offer up some brand new features. For instance, when the game begins, players can choose to be either a boy or girl. The game also features a new two-on-two battle system, which allows gamers to link up with three friends and battle in teams or battle two trainers at once while traveling through Hoenn. Two-on-two battles can also be done with two players, where each has two Pokmon on the field instead of the traditional single battles. 

<p>Another new feature in the games is the Pokmon Contest. At a Pokmon Contest, players will compete against three Pokmon in five kinds of contests -- Cool, Beauty, Cute, Smart, and Tough. Each contest type emphasizes certain Pokmon conditions, and each contest has four ranks -- Normal, Super, Hyper and Master -- that a Pokmon must pass through on its way to the top. Your Pokmon is judged as it performs actions from its moves list. The judge reviews, which Pokmon gets the most applause from the audience.

<p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03gbasp-1.jpg" align=left><b><I>Game Boy Advance SP</I></b><br>

Redesigned GBA  Nintendo  March 23, 2003

<p>SP meaning Special of course. The GBA SP is a brand new version of the successful Game Boy Advance. With a sleek new folding design, front-lit screen, rechargeable lithium ion battery, and a new multi-out port, Nintendo has addressed and improved on nearly all of the things about the original GBA that bothered fans. However, internally the SP is identical to the original GBA; this is not a new system, just the reissuing of a favorite. The new design and subsequent marketing strategy suggests that Nintendo may actually be marketing the device to adults as well as kids. Gamers can expect the built in rechargeable battery to get around 18 hours per charge if the light it turned off and around 10 if the light screen is on, with a recharge time of around three hours. 

<p>All GBA games are compatible with the GBA SP and the device is backward compatible, allowing use with practically all games and accessories previously released in the Game Boy line. Also, Nintendo will continue to manufacture and market the regular Game Boy Advance, which has now sold more than 11.5 million units in North America since its launch a little more than a year ago. The system will hit retail shelves across North America for an MSRP of $99.95 on March 23rd.

<p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03thewindwaker.jpg" align=right><b><I>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</I></b><br> 

GameCube - Nintendo - March 24, 2003

<p><I>Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</I> is undisputedly the most anticipated GCN game of 2003. All Zelda fans have been waiting for this title since a teaser trailer depicting a fight between Ganondorf and Link was unveiled at Space World 2000. However, the <I>Legend of Zelda</I> series has been reborn in <I>The Wind Waker</I>. In a controversial move, Nintendo made this new installment cel-shaded, but this new style allows Links world to come alive in ways never before imagined. Navigate Link across oceans and over islands on a quest to save his kidnapped sister Arilla. As a bonus, if you hurry up and preorder <I>The Wind Waker</I>, Nintendo will include a GCN version of <I>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</I> and the never before released <I>Ocarina of Time: Master Quest</I> (Also known as <I>Ura Zelda</I>); a remix of the game that includes tougher dungeons and other changes throughout, which has been available since February 18.

GameCube  Nintendo  April 02, 2003

<p>Avalanche is the sequel to the Nintendo 64 hit <I>1080 Snowboarding</I>. Showing much promise, the title is developed by NST (developer responsible for <I>Wave Race: Blue Storm</I>) and is said to extend on the gameplay mechanics laid out in the original and offer up a plateful of new and original features. Players should expect very interactive environments, anything from falling trees to animals that run away if spooked. The games courses (tracks, levels, whatever you would like to call them) are said to feature many different paths and interact with the player to a much larger degree than seen in the original. In addition to this, <I>1080 Avalanche</I> will contain a refined particle system, a hefty number of playable characters, and many original tricks. The game is still reality based, meaning that players will perform tricks that real professionals do as opposed to over-the-top stuff seen in other snowboarding titles. For the snowboarding aficionado, <I>1080 Avalanche</I> will be sliding into stores this April.

<p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03goldensun2.jpg" align=right><b><I>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</I></b><br>

GBA  Camelot  April 14, 2003

<p><I>The Lost Age</I> picks up right where the original <I>Golden Sun</I>, for Game Boy Advance, left off. Without revealing too much about the ending of the original, characters from it regroup to prevent the destruction of their world (in <I>The Lost Age</I>). The plot has many surprises, according to Nintendo, as the team gets closer to releasing alchemy  with all its potential benefits and perils  on the land. The game features all new puzzles, a few new warriors that join the team, and the return of the Djinn. Djinn are collectible creatures that work in conjunction with your team and aid greatly in battle and the solving of puzzles. You can expect a full review of the highly anticipated sequel come its launch this April.

GameCube  Treasure  April 16, 2003

<p>It has been over a month since Infogrames announced that the GameCube version of the arcade shooter <I>Ikaruga</I> would be released in North America, but our celebration continues on. Developed by Treasure, the game was originally released in arcades only to make a late entry onto the ill-fated Dreamcast not too long ago, and now it will be flying onto everyones favorite cube. <I>Ikaruga</I> is a top-down shooter in which players can change the color of their ship to inflict additional damage on enemies of the opposite color or absorb enemy projectiles of the same color to power up their missile gauge. The GameCube version will feature numerous options and, possibly, modes that werent in the Dreamcast version, including a world ranking feature that ranks players on the official <I>Ikaruga</I> website by means of a password system.

GameCube  Nintendo  May 2003

<p>The Game Boy Player will allow gamers the ability to play any of the huge library of Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games on the GameCube. Since it doesnt actually require a GBA to play the games, the device essentially allows all GameCube owners access to a vast library of titles. The GB Player fits snugly underneath the GameCube and connects to the Hi Speed Port, which also provides its power (so no extra cords or batteries are required). 

<p>Gamers can use the regular GameCube controller or even the Wavebird wireless controller to play the games. But if you still want to hold a GBA while playing you can connect the two systems with the GCN/GBA link cable and control games with the handheld. The only downside (to some) would be that the device will only be available in one color, Jet Black.

<p>Mario has already made his debut on the GCN, but now it's time for the evil Wario to steal the spotlight. Wario has been hording gold and other trinkets in the basement of his castle for years, but a black jewel he recently acquired begins turning all his gems into monsters. Wario must battle his way through his basement if he wishes to reclaim his riches. As an added bonus, Treasure (famous for <I>Radiant Silvergun</I>) is developing <I>Wario World</I>. 



<p><font size="2"><i>{Due to recent controversy, Wario World may actually be released on May 26, 2003 as we originally speculated.

<p>Eidos is bringing the best seller <I>Hitman 2: Silent Assassin</I> to the GameCube this March. Developed by IO Interactive, the title has been a major success on the PS2 and Xbox. In the game, players must slip into the shoes of a genetically engineered assassin and make a living by killing. It's an intense third-person shooter that should be well worthwhile checking out next season.

<p>The original <I>Advance Wars</I> has been hailed by many as one of the best games to date on the Game boy Advance. Recently, Nintendo announced that it would be delivering a sequel to the title this year. Fans can expect more CO's, more play modes, more of everything, and quite possibly a whole lot that we dont know about yet.

<p><I>F-Zero</I> makes its next generation debut this year in a joint collaboration between Nintendo and Segas Amusement Vision. Being developed for both the Triforce Arcade hardware and GameCube, the game is said to be much faster, prettier, and more stylish than ever before. The newest incarnation of the futuristic racing series should boast excellent handling, as well as the (now customary) 20 to 40 racers to compete against. Judging by recent footage, it appears that the game will feature loads of classic cars and characters as well as a host of new ones for those aspiring for a change of pace. Oh, and as far as multiplayer options are concerned, <I>F-Zero</I> doesnt appear that it will disappoint. Four-player options are also expected in the upcoming racer.

GameCube - Namco - August 27, 2003

<p><I>Soul Calibur</I> is arguably the best fighting game ever created, and has been proclaimed the best game for the Dreamcast. On its release, <I>Soul Calibur</I> revolutionized fighting games with its use of 3D environments and gameplay. Building off this hit game, Namco is bringing <I>Soul Calibur II</I> to the GameCube some time in late 2003. This new version will feature all new characters, new moves, and some interactive levels. Although the interactivity reportedly isn't as much hoped for, there will be areas where we won't be subject to the dreaded "ring out." Not only will GCN receive a great fighting game, but as a bonus Namco is including Link as an unlockable character. Come on, you know youve always wanted to test out this Hyrulians skills against the likes of Voldo, Nightmare, and Arastaroth.

<p>One of the five GameCube only (for now at least) titles shown at a Capcom press conference in Tokyo last November, <I>Product Number 03</I> is directed by Shinji Mikami and could be one of this years best games. The story follows Vanessa Schneider, a mercenary for hire, who kills robots upon her client's request. However, the dark facets of her own past are quickly catching up with her. Vanessa must dodge, dance, and weave her way through the ranks of a diabolical militia of transforming mechs. Sadly not much else is known plot wise; however, we do know that the title is full of high-tech gadgetry, a slew of impressive <I>Matrix</I>-ish moves and exceptionally beautiful graphics. Come E3 2K3 Capcom will most likely divulge further details about the game.

<p>The Harvest Moon series makes its debut on the GameCube this year in a completely new and original title. <I>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life</I> will span a lifetime on the farm and follow the drama that goes with it. In the game players will try and run a successful farm as well as a successful social and family life in the new Forget-me-not Valley. The game will feature over 40 new unique characters to interact with, a new events system with six chapters of your life, and span 30 years. It is also confirmed that the game will have a much improved marriage and family system where players can actually raise their children have and watch he/she grow up.

However, exactly what those other surprises entail, only time will tell.

<p>As most of you already know, the Harvest Moon series is very unique. Every game in the series is completely non-linear, meaning that if you dont feel like feeding your animals, planting crops, or even buying animalsyou dont have to. Of course, there will be consequences for the actions players take, but having the choice is definitely a large factor in the lasting impact the series has had. We recommend you keep your eyes peeled later this year as Harvest Moon rolls onto store shelves.

Joe is just an ordinary guy making an action film, until he meets his mentor and is bestowed with viewtiful powers. The finer elements of the storyline are still vague, but we do know that Joe is called upon to kick some butt.

According to Capcom, players can freely fly like a bird into a world of epic proportions. Players will have to deal with many monsters and other vile creatures that inhabit the ancient land with the aide of a few allies. Capcom has also mentioned numerous times that the game world will evolve and change with the passing of each day. <I>Dead Phoenix</I> looks extremely promising and will be one of the first titles of its kind to hit the GameCube this year.

GBA  Square  TBA 2003

<p><I>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</I> is one of the most anticipated handheld titles this year. Recently launching in Japan with the Game Boy Advance SP, the game immediately shoved its way to the top of the charts and continues to sell at a phenomenal speed. Pretty much a sequel to Squaresofts Playstation strategic role-playing game, the title will mark the first appearance of the famed developer on the GBA. Though similar in style to its predecessor, <I>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</I> is a completely new adventure created specifically for the GBA. 

<p>Fans of the original will be happy to hear that <I>FF Tactics Advance</I> is still focused on allowing players to build up a personalized, well-balanced squad of troops. The game also features five different character races and a very involving story. While no North American release date has been announced, as of yet, the game will most likely hit shelves later this year. The large amount of Japanese text to translate in the game could be a root cause of the delay.

GameCube  Silicon Knights  TBA 2003

<p>Silicon Knights has been in the process of creating the cinematic <I>Too Human</I> since shortly after the completion of <I>Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</I>. Though Nintendo and SK are mum on whether it is still in development, we at N-Sider cant see how the (near complete) title could have been abandoned. 

<p>An adult oriented title; <I>Too Human</I> takes place in the year 2450 A.D, where technology has taken over humankind's soul and identity. Gamers take control of John Franks, an undercover cop as he begins his journey inside a company named Aesir Corporation, where he's investigating his partner's mysterious death. The mission reveals more than Franks had bargained for. The gameplay is heavily centered on biomechanics and cyborg technology. The game is said to be similar to <I>Legacy of Kain</I> in that it's an action adventure with RPG elements as well. It is also slated to be 80 hours long (according to past Silicon Knights statements), feature everything from stealth maneuvering to epic bosses, and be in a very atmospheric and dark world. 

<p>Here is a little food for thought. When <I>Too Human</I> was originally headed to the Playstation (before SK became a Nintendo 2nd party), the game featured around two and a half hours of Redbook audio, and over an hour of pre-rendered CG. We can only imagine how refined the game will be come later this year.

GameCube  Nintendo  TBA 2003

<p><I>Mario Kart</I> makes its next generation debut this year, and yet we still know little to nothing about the title. What little we do know came from a short video at E3 2002, which showed Mario and Luigi driving the traditional go-karts around a street like area. Players can expect four-player capabilities, as well as the traditional set of characters, locales, and items. What isnt yet known is whether or not the new <I>Mario Kart</I> will feature online play. Last year Shigeru Miyamoto stated that the game would be the perfect choice for a network title, but went on to say that the company wouldnt do it unless the online business model made sense from a financial standpoint. Most likely, the answer to the online question wont be answered until this years Electronic Entertainment Exposition (E3 2003).

<p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03pikmin2-1.jpg" align=left><b><I>Pikmin 2</I></b><br>

GameCube  Nintendo  TBA 2003

<p>It has been known for quite some time that a sequel to the innovative <I>Pikmin</I> was in development. The original had players controlling Olimar as he searched far and wide on an unknown planet in a search for the missing pieces of his spaceship, which crash landed after being hit by an asteroid. While criticized by many as being too short, the title is considered by many to be one of the best offerings on the GameCube. As for <I>Pikmin 2</I>, well we dont know a whole lot at this point. Recent pictures indicate that there will be multiplayer action, but what that entails we are not certain. The possibilities are endless and we suspect that the game will make use of the GBA/GCN link up capabilities in some form as well. However, for those hoping for an online <I>Pikmin</I> game this year, nothing is for certain but dont get your hopes up.

 <p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wh03crystalchronicles-1.jpg" align=right><b><I>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</I></b><br>

GameCube, GBA  Square - TBA 2003

<p><I>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</I> is just about the most anticipated GameCube game of the year. Yet, it is the one we know the least about. Funded by former Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchis Fund Q, the game will mark the first Square title on a Nintendo console for over six years. From the little footage we have seen over the past year, it appears that <I>Crystal Chronicles</I> will be a departure from the traditional turn-based action found in most Final Fantasy titles. However, that doesnt mean that the game wont feel like a Final Fantasy title. Actually, the graphical style of <I>Crystal Chronicles</I> appears to be somewhat reminiscent of <I>Final Fantasy IX</I>.

<p>The most interesting aspect of the upcoming game is its connection to the Game Boy Advance. Nintendo and Square have claimed that the game will introduce substantial link-up capabilities with the handheld. Several publications have predicted that there will be some way to take your character on the road in the Game Boy Advance version to gain experience, only to be able to reconnect and upload your progress back to the GameCube upon return home. However, others now cling to previous announcements by Square that the Game Boy Advance completely replaces your controller in the link feature. If this were the case, all character information would be displayed on the GBAs screen; a handy means of concealment if you ask us. 

<p>In all honesty speculation is irrelevant. Trust us, ignorance is bliss. The answers to everything you could ever wonder about <I>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</I> will be on its way to a store near you later this year.

GameCube  Capcom  2nd Quarter 2004

<p>Another of the five GameCube only (for now) titles shown at a Capcom press conference in Tokyo last November, <I>Killer 7</I> is directed by Goichi Suda and follows the rivalry of Harmon Smith - a dangerous old man in a wheelchair with seven different multiple personalities and Kun Lan  a man capable of overthrowing governments. The games plot pretty much follows the two men over five stories and four interconnected worlds. Smith must do all in his power to stop the corruption Lan intends to spread. The unique story isnt the only thing <I>Killer 7</I> has going for it. The game features an artistically rich graphical style that utilizes cel-shading in a very distinctive manner. A departure from the norm, <I>Killer 7</I> looks to be a title worth checking out.

<p><b><I>Animal Crossing 2</I></b><br>

GameCube  Nintendo  TBA 2003 or 2004

<p>There has been much speculation about <I>Animal Crossing 2</I>. While unlikely it will hit North America by year-end because of the hefty translation involved, Nintendo has confirmed that the title is in development. The original AC recently picked up three AIAS awards including best console RPG. <I>Animal Crossing</I> is a game that breaks the mold. With a genre all its own, AC cannot be explained with mere words, it must be experienced. We can only expect the best from its sequel.

<p>Last March (2002) Nintendo and Camelot announced that a GameCube sequel to <I>Mario Tennis 64</I> was in development and actually released a few screenshots of the prospective title. It was stated that the title would be very similar to its 64-bit predecessor. However, nothing has been seen or heard of the title since. There have been rumors that the title has been revamped considerably, but we wont know for sure until E3 2003 this May.

<p><i>This should lay to rest any fears that 2003 is going to be anything but a monster year for the GameCube and Game Boy Advance. While release dates are subject to change, the majority of the titles above should make it out in 2003. I guess now the only problem is deciding what to buy. =)



<p>For a look at some of the excellent games that may not have been covered here or are already released in North America be sure and take a look at the PAL section of the feature.</i>
