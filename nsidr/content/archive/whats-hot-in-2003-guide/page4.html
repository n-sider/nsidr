<H3>What's <i>HOT</i> in 2003!!! - Conclusion.</H3>



<P>Phew, so ends this feature!!!  We certainly hope we've whetted your appetites with all these potentially great games that we've highlighted.  What we've tried to do is separate the men from the boys and highlight only the premium stuff, the reasons why we play on and own our Nintendo systems.  



<P>While we think these are the cream of the crop, there's plenty of room for surprises and things to come out of nowhere to blow our minds, and to that we say "Cheers!".  



<P>2003 is already shaping up to be a bumper year for Nintendo fans, and the promise of all this great stuff should be enough to keep you going until 2004 rolls around.  Funnily enough, there's probably more that we don't know about.



<P>Nintendo has a scary reputation of being very secretive, so who knows what Miyamoto and co. have cooking for us to enjoy this year and beyond.  



<P>So, no matter where you are in the world, there's something to look forward to.  And that's <I>always</i> a good thing.  Enjoy 2003 with all its gaming goodness and surprises, and hopefully it's all the tip of the iceberg for what's to come in 2004.
