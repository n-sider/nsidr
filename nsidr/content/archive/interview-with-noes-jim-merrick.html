<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Q:</b> How is movement of the controller detected?
<br><br>
<b>Merrick</b>: We use Bluetooth technology to communicate between the controller and what we call a 'sensor bar', which has two little sensors on it that are maybe a foot apart. These sensors can be detached from the bar and they can be above the TV or below the TV - it doesn't really matter. There's really no set-up other than just putting the bar by the TV. There's no calibration for size or type of TV or anything like that.
