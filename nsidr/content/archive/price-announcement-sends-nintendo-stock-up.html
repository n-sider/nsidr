<p>Japanese investors like <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>'s "less than $300" price point he <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1661">gave for the upcoming Revolution console</a> &mdash; so much so that shares of Nintendo Co. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000101&sid=auV6eyCXPnbk&refer=japan">gained 6.4%</a> before the close of trading today, according to a Bloomberg report.</p>

<p>Judging by the Bloomberg story, investors across the Pacific seem fairly confident in Nintendo's plans going forward.  For example, an analyst for KBC Securities comments that Nintendo Co. has certainly beat expectations in Japan as well as managing to "turn around their performance in the U.S., which wasn't the case earlier this year."</p>
