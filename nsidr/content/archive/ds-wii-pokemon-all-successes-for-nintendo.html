Nintendo Co., Ltd. released their fiscal year-end financials today, which displayed their revenues up 90% and operating profit up 150% from the previous year&mdash;both revenue and profit representing record highs for the company.<br />
<br />
Nintendo credited their sales success with Nintendo DS and Wii with the increases in both numbers.  Over their last fiscal year, which ran from April 2006 through March 2007, they sold 23 million new Nintendo DS systems, bringing worldwide installed base to 40 million.  Wii, introduced this past November, shipped 5.84 million units&mdash;and "virtually all" were sold, as even today it's difficult to actually find systems on retailer shelves.<br />
<br />
The company also drew attention to this week's introduction of <i>Pok&eacute;mon Diamond</i> and <i>Pok&eacute;mon Pearl</i>, new Nintendo DS entries in the proven franchise.  Since their release in Japan this past September, the games have sold over 5 million combined.  The games were released in North America this past Sunday, and in five days sold through one million copies in that territory.<br />
<br />
For the coming year, Nintendo projects sales of 14 million more Wii systems and 55 million games, alongside 22 million NIntendo DS systems and 130 million games.  They expect sales to rise 18% and operating profits to rise 20%.
