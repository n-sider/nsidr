<p>As <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/674/674746p1.html">reported by IGN DS</a>, preliminary NPD numbers for November have shown that even with the release of <i>Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories</i> for the PlayStation Portable, the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>, backed by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a>, sold about 380,000 units to the PSP's about 360,000.</p>

<p>Even more interesting is the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a>'s performance, though, selling through around 900,000 units across all platform variations including the new TFT <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=23>Game Boy Advance SP</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=28>Game Boy Micro</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, we say "preliminary"; NPD has issued an alert saying some of these numbers are "overstated" and will be corrected in the near future.  Still, with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1585">Nintendo themselves claiming</a> 2.37 million Nintendo DS units sold through October compared to the PSP's 2.16 million, the Nintendo DS appears to be winning the next-generation handheld race for 2005.</p>
