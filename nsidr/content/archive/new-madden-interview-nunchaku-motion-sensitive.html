<p>In <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/703/703727p1.html">a new interview</a> with EA Canada's John Schappert on the yet-untitled Madden installation being created for Wii, Schappert confirms a rumored feature of Wii's nunchaku-style analog stick:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>IGN Wii:</b> Does you use the trigger buttons on the nunchuck unit?</p>

<p><b>John Schappert:</b> You know, the buttons are all still being mapped out. It does use the trigger buttons right now. I don't know how much we'll have locked in for you at E3 because we are still working on the final button layout, but it does use the trigger buttons, and it does use the accelerometer in the nunchuck unit as well for juking.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition, Schappert also confirms that Wii will support 480p progressive-scan mode as well as both 4&times;3 and 16&times;9 aspect ratios, and that the Madden title will support 480p at 16&times;9 with a capable set.  EA also plans to make the title online, though they are not saying whether they will make use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.</p>
