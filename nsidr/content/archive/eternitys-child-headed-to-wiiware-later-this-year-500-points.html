Originally planned for Xbox Live Arcade, then for a retail release for Wii, <i>Eternity's Child</i> has moved once again, this time to Nintendo's digital download service, WiiWare. A DS version is also in the works, but little is known except that it is 3D rather than 2D.<br />
<br />
Eternity's Child is a free-roaming side-scrolling adventure that takes place in a fantastic, hand-drawn world. Players control Angel, an orphan who lost his wings at a young age. He is traveling through the world to find any trace of his long-lost people. The game deals with issues such as pollution, global warming, and racism.<br />
<br />
N-Europe's recent interview with Luc Bernard, the man behind the game, revealed a few new details to the world. The game will have various control schemes, with and without the nunchuk and motion controls. Bernard also mentioned that he would like to add WiFi features to the game, but said nothing more.<br />
<br />
The WiiWare version of Eternity's Child is currently planned for release in the second fiscal quarter of 2008, for a mere 500 points. The DS version currently has no release date.<br />
