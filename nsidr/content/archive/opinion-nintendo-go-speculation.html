<p>So one of the stories that is making rounds at the moment is the Nintendo Go logo.  A reader apparently sent this image to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/23/nintendo-revolution-nintendo-go/">Engadget.com</a>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-03-23-nintendogo.jpg" border="1" alt="Nintendo Go rumored logo for Nintendo Revolution"></p> 

<p>From N-Sider's perspective, the logo makes slight sense.  After all, it takes the D-Pad -- an object that represents gaming and Nintendo has standardized in the Revmote, Nintendo DS and Game Boy micro -- and puts it in the third-dimension, which again represents the somewhat 3D control allowed by the Revolution controller.  The blue logo also ties in with the blue LED that is a distinct feature on the console.  Furthermore, its been found that the Japanese word "Go" translates to "five", which may correlate with this being Nintendo's fifth console. Is this something that meshes with Nintendo's strategy?  It's hard to tell however one can envision the image being a bit amateurish and fan-made.  In the meantime, we'll just have to wait for the official word from Nintendo.</p>
