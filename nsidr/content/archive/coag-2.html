<h3 align="center"> Episode II  EB Idiocy</h3>
<p>By: Dean Bergmann</p>
<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/dean_15.jpg" align="left" alt="Don't ask.">Welcome back my loyal readers; its just about that time for the second
incarnation of what I like to call: <i> Confusions of a Gamer</i>. But before we get
started, I think I should give a brief rundown for first time readers. What this
series of articles (does it count as a series yet since this is only the second
episode?) is, are stories based on real-life experiences that relate to gaming
or Nintendo in general. Due to the feedback from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=features/confusions_episode1.htm"> last weeks article</a> (which
you can find summarized at the bottom of this page) the lovely staff here at
N-Sider has given the go-ahead to keep this as a weekly feature, apparently
updated on Saturdays for enjoyable weekend reading.<br>
<br>
Now, since most of us here are all gamers of some sort, chances are youve had
to venture to a little store called <i> Electronics Boutique</i>. Keep in mind that
Im in Canada, and our only real choices for video game purchases are <i>EB</i>,
<i> Toys
R Us</i>, and a place called <i>Compucentre</i>. Theres no fancy <i> Software,
etc</i>. or <i>
GameStop</i> or whatever other crazy stores are out there. Anyways, chances are
youve shopped at an EB before. And if youve shopped at an EB, then it is a
widely known fact of their idiocy and ignorance when it comes to answering
questions properly.<br>
<br>
If you know the back story to N-Sider at all, youll know that Fran Mirabella
(formerly of <i>IGNCube</i>, now of<i> IGNInsider</i>) funds and operates our site. Back
before the GameCube launched in 2001, IGN started the Educate the Retailers
campaign. I of course, participated and took the entire booklet of info to EB.
Dumbfounded they took the package and undoubtedly used it to keep a PlayStation2
kiosk from wobbling. What they did not know however, is I recorded the entire
thing on audio  which was later posted on IGN as probably one of the most
comical pieces of my online-journalistic history.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to May 10, 2003. Brenden arrives for our trip to E3 and we had
earlier discussed getting a link cable for the flight/hotel Four Swords action.
Our first, and most logical choice was Electronics Boutique (this is on our
pre-e3 antics video released in the forums and on our VCD by the way), and we
venture into the store.<br>
<br>
Do you have any GBA Link Cables? Brenden asks. The EB employee proceeds to
give us a Monster 3rd party link cable, and promptly says thats the only ones
they carry. I pipe up and say We can go up to Zellers and get the official
ones, she quickly replied with Oh you wanted the official ones?<br>
<br>
Needless to say, they didnt have any official Nintendo GBA Link Cables, and
it strikes me as odd that she wouldnt offer the ones of higher quality first.
So that wasnt the best example but this next one youll just die for.
Either itll be you laughing at me for being a mega-nerd, or you laughing at
me because you realized that you do the exact same thing as Im about to
outline.<br>
<br>
Being media, and you being readers of online-media, we all get information
before most print sources and stores; and because of that fact I absolutely love
to go in and test the employees at my local EB on their various knowledge, or
lack thereof. Remember the announcement for the Onyx and Crimson/Red GBA SPs
coming to North America later this year? Well I trucked in and proceeded to ask
the question What is the expected release date and price point for the Onyx
GBA SP?  Now, granted there isnt a release date (that I am aware of)
yet, I wanted to see if they had even heard about the new colours. Apparently
not, according to Electronics Boutique, those systems do not exist, and wont
ever exist, because its not in their computer system! I asked them if there
is an expected release and they proceeded to tell me that the only available
colours were the Platinum and Cobalt Blue, no others, ever. I found it funny
that she said ever, because I just left with a grin on my face.<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention earlier that almost a year ago, before I got my job at the
Cineplex Odeon (in the very same mall) I had an interview at EB. All was going
well until they asked me what I thought about Napster. Napster?! Hasnt it
been dead for like 3 years now? However, I replied saying that the company was
not at fault as it was the users spreading the files; they were merely providing
a service. Needless to say I didnt get the job  the irony, an editor for
an online-gaming media site isnt good enough to work at a game store. Oh
well, life goes on.<br>
<br>
Continuing the story, just last week I told a friend of mine, Ben (formerly of
Tendogamers) about the idiocy of Electronics Boutique and having some experience
with it himself, he agreed to ask the Onyx GBA question. I walked in with him
and proceeded to browse the used GameCube section. Listening in, the
conversation went as follows:<br>
<br>
<b>
Ben></b> Do you happen to know the price and release date of the Onyx GameBoy
Advance SP?<br>
<b>
EB Employee></b> What system is that for?<br>
<b>
Ben></b> Uh, the GameBoy Advance SP<br>
<b>
EB Employee></b> Im not seeing it listed, let me check another source. You
said its for the GameBoy Advance SP?<br>
<b>
Ben> </b> It is the GameBoy Advance SP. Its a new colour. They have a red one
coming too<br>
<b>
EB Employee></b> Where did you hear about this?<br>
<b>
Ben></b> Well Im media its my job to know this stuff<br>
<b>
EB Employee></b> Well we dont have it coming out here. I know its going to
come out in Japan but not in North America<br>
<b>
Ben> </b> Nintendo just announced it.<br>
<b>
EB Employee></b> No they didnt, its not coming out here.<br>
<br>
We quickly left. I always find it weird when EB employees who either blatantly
knows theyre wrong or are plain stupid, try to cover up their own mistakes by
trying to make you look like an idiot for asking the question. She thought Onyx
was a game, now granted that could be a pretty cool title but I really dont
know what it is with these people. If any of you are EB employees, then I extend
my pure grievance for you  Im sure youre not as bad as the ones around
here. The only reason I even applied for that job was to balance out the Xbox/PS2
surplus of fanboy employees with a little GCN goodness. Alas that did not happen
and my life goes on.<br>
<br>
Over the years, EB has been a constant source of frustration and angst. Ive
tried various other questions about games (such as Eternal Darkness, and Final
Fantasy to which I was told that Nintendo would never see another Final Fantasy
game on their systems ever  isnt that a hoot?) and Nintendo hardware. The
only positive advice Ive ever gotten from EB was to not buy a VirtualBoy when
it came out  they told me it was a stepping stone from the SNES to what was
then called the Ultra64.<br>
<br>
Granted not all locations are this bad, over at another mall in the city, a
former artist of ours, Kevin Freitas used to work at EB (this was somewhere along the
lines of 3 years ago) and he really balanced out the stupidity, he balanced it
to the point where the entire rest of the staff became GameCube lovers and
eventually all got fired (no joke) at the same time  coincidence? I think
not!<br>
<br>
In the end Im sure EB isnt totally a lost cause, however its stores
like the one near me that are responsible for the teenage gamers between the
ages of 12-15 who think that <i> Grand Theft Auto 3</i> is the shrine of all videogames
and that life is about hookers and drug-dealing. With that said, this article is
coming to a close  join me next week when I talk about my beefs with the
gamers who think they know everything crowd. You know the type, they tell
you that every game under the sun featuring a gun (yes that rhymed, shut up.) is
cool and that everyone and their mom should play it? Yeah, those kids, see you
guys (and gals) next week!<br>
<br>
Now as I stated above, here are some of the horror stories I asked for last
week. Which reminds me, if you have any EB idiocy or any other game-store
related idiocy, dont hesitate to <a href="mailto:dean@n-sider.com?subject=eb idiocy"> email me</a> with it.</font>

<p><b><font face="Arial">The Nightmare of Young Gamers</font></b></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial"><font size="2">Dean, first of all I would like to commend you on<br>
writing that piece.  Im glad somebody can stand up<br>
and tell people what they believe in.  I work for a<br>
gaming site (it isnt popular yet and I dont want to<br>
give out the domain), but sometimes what I write<br>
sounds fanboyish or ignorant or it just doesnt flow<br>
with the rest of the staff, and so I throw it out,<br>
even though secretly I wish I could publish it. <br>
<br>
Secondly, I would like to add that it isnt just the<br>
younger gamers that do this, high school students (you<br>
said it in your forum post) act like this too.  Im 18<br>
and my friends were the on again off again type gamer.<br>
 I eventually became the hardcore gamer and then<br>
became the casuals.  Whenever I talk to them they<br>
talk about how Grand Theft Auto is the greatest series<br>
ever and how Mario sucks.  It makes me upset and I try<br>
to go into the whole hardcore gamer mode, but it<br>
doesnt work.  I also notice how they dont care about<br>
beating a game the regular way.  They ask for codes<br>
and for help.  One time a guy even called me up and<br>
asked me how to get a weapon and it took me about<br>
twenty minutes to finish telling him how to do it.<br>
<br>
Another thing I want to mention about the new high<br>
school gamer is the fact that they just dont get the<br>
difference between games.  I own an Xbox, I bought it<br>
for Halo and a DVD player, and a lack of something<br>
else for Christmas, and basically one day my friend<br>
found out that Metroid Prime was in first person. <br>
This in itself is a double standard, he thought it was<br>
third person and he said that all games in third<br>
person suck!  Well he takes the controller, I start<br>
him in the frigate part of the game, and before he<br>
even gets to the Queen Parasite he gets mad and says<br>
this game sucks, its not like Halo at all!  I go on<br>
to tell him that it isnt supposed to be like Halo,<br>
and he just looks at me like Im an idiot.<br>
<br>
Then theres my experience with Final Fantasy X.  Im<br>
not an RPG gamer, and I own a PS2 but I never play it,<br>
but the only time I ever saw the game being played I<br>
was completely unimpressed.  Five minutes worth of<br>
battle and twenty minutes worth of FMV with a short<br>
five second walk does not make a good game.  At least,<br>
thats not my definition of a good game.  Then I sit<br>
next to a gamer that Ive known for years, he used to<br>
play with me on a daily basis and then we had a drift,<br>
and he quit gaming for a while.  He tells me about<br>
Final Fantasy VIII (I think) and he explains that it<br>
was amazing because the ending was a half hour long! <br>
I about killed the guy because he said that was the<br>
best part of the game.<br>
<br>
Then of course Ill go back to Metroid guy.  I already<br>
discussed Halo well a while ago we had Halo night<br>
for a great multiplayer experience.  Before he<br>
became good he whined about the rest of us being too<br>
good.  I did well, prior to our fourth member being<br>
there I destroyed the two (they were new, and so was<br>
I) by losing by three or four, they were a team and I<br>
was just myself.  Then we played free-for-all, and we<br>
had to change the rules to teams and a special weapons<br>
set for him so that he could win.  Eventually he took<br>
lessons to become good by learning to camp and<br>
snipe.  We take them on and Snipes sits back and camps<br>
and he says hes good when I tell him that he sucks.<br>
 We switch games to Nightfire one night, a game Ive<br>
played a bit, I didnt own it though, and I lead with<br>
kills.  He says the game sucks and then yells that we<br>
have to go back to Halo.  This to me is equal to your<br>
cousins and asking for your help.  I just want to<br>
win, and if I cant win then Ill bend the rules so<br>
that I can.<br>
<br>
This actually brings me to my own cousins.  A few<br>
weekends ago we were sitting there waiting for my<br>
grandparents, aunts and uncles, and parents to arrive<br>
and I was watching them play a few sports games on the<br>
PS2.  My older cousin was destroying my younger one,<br>
ages 19 and 14, and I saw another pattern.  The<br>
younger one couldnt beat him, and he knew he couldnt<br>
beat him, so he asked for a different game.  After<br>
five games the guy realized he couldnt win, and<br>
instead of improving he just gave up.  I remember when<br>
I was younger I would keep playing until I could at<br>
least be equal to my brother. <br>
<br>
Part of your problem though is that your cousins are<br>
young.  I started gaming at the age of 3, and I<br>
watched my dad and brother play Atari, usually Donkey<br>
Kong.  We bought our NES when I was 5, the first time<br>
I ever played Super Mario Bros., I asked my dad to<br>
help me.  Eventually when I was six or seven and<br>
couldnt beat a really hard part I would ask my<br>
brother.  Big brother will you pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease<br>
beat this for me?  After a while he would and I would<br>
go on playing.  It was because I just didnt have the<br>
necessary skill to beat certain games.  While others<br>
that we both couldnt I would just pop in my game<br>
genie and have a good old time.  I played for the fun<br>
though, not to win.  Then eventually I evolved and got<br>
better.  Then I stopped asking for help and just tried<br>
and tried again.  They might grow out of it Dean, if<br>
not then you will hate them for life, just like I do<br>
with all of my gaming friends and my younger cousin. <br>
<br>
The one thing that almost all of these people have in<br>
common is that they havent played games prior to the<br>
Playstation era.  I hope this has been insightful, or<br>
at least make a few points to help illustrate your<br>
point.</font><br>
