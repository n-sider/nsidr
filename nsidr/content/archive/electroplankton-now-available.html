<p>We've given <i>Electoplankton</i> its due coverage here, to be sure, starting with James Burns' definitive <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/inside-electroplankton">Inside Electroplankton</a>  a look into not just the game and its impact, but its and its creator's history as well.  Most recently, we've also had <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1637">a look at the US version</a>: the title survived localization with all its charm intact.</p>

<p>The title is rated E by the ESRB and sells for around $35 wherever it may be found, including <a href="http://store.nintendo.com/electroplankton/">direct from Nintendo's online store</a>.</p>
