Present for the event was producer Kentaro Hisai, who signed autographs and talked about the title with shoppers.<br />
<br />
Spectrobes is a rarity for Disney&mdash;a title without any preexisting Disney IP attached to it.  Developed by <i>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</i> studio Jupiter, Spectrobes has players excavate fossils of the titular creatures using the touch screen, then train and outfit them for battle.  The game supports wireless competition and an online linkup to the Spectrobes web site via Wi-Fi, as well as a novel card system where players tap holes cut out of the cards to unlock new game features.<br />
<br />
Spectrobes should be available in stores today and is rated E by the ESRB.
