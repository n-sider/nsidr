We're proud to announce the winners of our Naruto Giveaway Extravaganza.  David Orr, of Hazel Crest, Illinois, walked away with Naruto: Clash of Ninja for the Nintendo GameCube by submitting the following Haiku:<br><br>

<div style="padding-left: 10px; margin-left: 140px; border-left: 1px solid #808080;">
Red haired Sakura...<br>
Wants Sasuke's affection?<br>
Or his butt sex - su?
</div><br>

...a little unorthodox, but amusing enough to tickle our fancy.  Naruto: Ninja Council for the GBA went to the lucky Rebecca Burks of Toronto, Ontario.<br><br>

<b>Update:</b> Just to clear up any confusion, we counted "Sasuke" in the second line as three syllables, not two, due to its pronunciation in Japanese as "Sa-su-ke" and the Japanese origin of the Haiku itself.<br><br>

Congratulations to the winners, and better luck to everyone else on our next contest!
