<p>The California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement has closed the offices of video game publisher Interplay after finding the company was without workers compensation insurance and had not paid employees, according to GameSpot.</p>

<p>Interplay was fined $1,000 for each employee on the payroll for a total of $79,000. This sum is in addition to the $179,000 it already owes the state in back taxes and the $432,000 in unpaid rent it owes its landlord, Arden Realty.  The company is also being sued for $156,000 in unpaid <i>Baldur's Gate</i> royalties by BioWare.</p>

<p>Interplay CEO Herve Caen insists that the company is still alive, however many Interplay employees are weary of the company's future.</p>
