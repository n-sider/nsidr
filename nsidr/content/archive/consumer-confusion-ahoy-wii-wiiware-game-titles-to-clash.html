New Sydney studio Nnooo has a small problem with their debut WiiWare effort, <i>Pop</i>: it's going to be beat out of the gate by a 505 Games disc release confusingly titled <i>Pop!</i><br />
<br />
"We would like to confirm that our title Pop is still on track and on schedule to be released within the WiiWare launch window and would also like to point out that our game is in no way related or affiliated with Pop! which is coming out as a Wii disc game in the near future," Nic Watt of Nnooo tells us.  "Pop as developed by Nnooo is currently exclusive to Wii and the WiiWare service."<br />
<br />
From retailer sites, we've gathered that 505's game will at least hit the UK and Australia in February.  Nnooo's effort (which we've got <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6114&view=screens">25 new screens</a> for) can probably be expected in March or April&#8212;whenever Nintendo decides the time is right for WiiWare to get off the ground.
