The latest in fashion for the DS Lite is a two-tone color scheme&mdash;the top half crimson and the bottom half black. This new color will hit stores August 21 and come bundled with a brand new copy of <i>Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day</i> for the price of $149.99. <br />

The bundle is already available to Canadians for $159.99, and it comes with a snazzy carrying case, which is as of yet unconfirmed for the US bundle.
