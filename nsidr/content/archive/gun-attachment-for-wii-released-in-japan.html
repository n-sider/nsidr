Japanese company Vis-a-Vis recently released a <a href="http://www.visavis.jp/shop/WebObjects/vv.woa/wa/dp?p=6927043058015">Wii gun attachment</a> for the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. The unit, called Gun Hazard, works like a cradle, and the Nunchuck fits into the handle; the Wii Remote attaches into the top of the barrel.<br />
<br />
This accessory was made to offer gamers a new method to play <i>Resident Evil 4</i> for Wii (known as Biohazard 4 in Japan), but there is nothing barring it from playing other games as well. It is selling for 2,520 yen, and no announcement has been made about its release in other territories. However, Rob at <a href="http://www.nintendo-gaming.nl/">Nintendo Gaming</a> in the Netherlands found the attachment for sale at the <a href="http://videogame.brando.com.hk/prod_detail.php?prod_id=00463">Brando Workshop</a> for $17.<br />
