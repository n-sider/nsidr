<p>At his blog <a href="http://www.apreche.net/blog/">Gourmet Geek</a>, Scott Rubin details <a href="http://www.apreche.net/blog/2005/10/14#dswifi">his experiences with the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Connection</a> interface at the DigitalLife expo in NYC (which <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1399">we previously reported on</a>).  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/apreche/sets/1139761/show/">Pictures</a> are also supplied.</p>

<p>Rubin confirms that users are able to create up to three connection profiles.  WEP encryption is explicitly supported, however, unfortunately, WPA encryption is not.  Users also have the option of using Buffalo's <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/wireless/products/AOSS.html">AOSS technology</a> to configure their connections with significantly less effort than manual setup.</p>
