<p>Zelda series producer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=6">Eiji  Aonuma</a> recently sat down with EGM and revealed a few cryptic clues about the upcoming Zelda DS game to the magazine.</p>

<blockquote><p>"What I can tell you is that it's going to use the touch screen for a very unique control system that people have never experienced in a Zelda game before.</p>

<p>"What I I think one of the important elements of the Zelda series has always been that you feel like you're in the world doing the things that Link is doing and touching the things that Link is touching.</p>

<p>"This time you'll be able to use the touch screen and actually touch those items and objects yourself.</p></blockquote>
