EBGames Canada has recently sent out an e-mail stating that Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation 3 pre-orders will be available on Monday, October 16th. A $50 trade-in credit or $200 cash deposit is required for either console.<br />
<br />
EB suggests calling ahead for availability, as supplies are limited.
