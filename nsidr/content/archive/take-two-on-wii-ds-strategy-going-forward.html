At their second-quarter earnings <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/38017">conference call</a> for FY 2007, Rockstar and 2K parent company Take Two Interactive were asked by Banc of America's Michael Savner about their strategy for Wii going forward, in light of the company's previous management largely ignoring the platform.  Board chairman Strauss Zelnick responded thusly:<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Strauss Zelnick, Chairman of the Board, Take Two Interactive</span>To be perfectly frank, I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to realize what's going on with Wii and DS. I will tell you that very quickly we turned to both 2K and to Rockstar and said "guys, we need a DS strategy and a Wii strategy" and we are working on it. As we get into the next quarter and into budget season for 2008, everybody in this company is completely focused on it.<br />
<br />
Having said that, development cycles are long. Sports aren't as good as games develop for specific platforms but we are looking at all of them across the board for Wii and DS. I will tell you that <i>Carnival Games</i> that we've announced for the Wii have gotten a lot of attention in the marketplace, as well as with our first-party partners. So we are pretty excited about that.<br />
<br />
We have some&mdash;some have been announced, some Wii titles have been announced and we are working to put more out on the Wii and DS.</div></div><br />
Despite what Zelnick says, Carnival Games doesn't seem to be Take Two's big attention-grabber for Wii: Rockstar is currently garnering a lot of attention for their upcoming Wii port of <i>Manhunt 2</i>, which offers increased levels of gore as well as a rather hands-on control scheme. Manhunt 2 hits retail July 10, and Carnival Games is slated for a summer release.
