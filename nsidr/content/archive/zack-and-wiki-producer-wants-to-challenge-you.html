In an interview with <i>Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure</i> producer Hironobu Takeshita, Wired's Chris Kohler got <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/09/interview-zack-.html">a few good quotes</a> about the title as well as the Camelot-developed <i>We Love Golf</i> Capcom is also working on.<br />
<br />
"The director of Zack and Wiki is a really big fan of PC point-and-click titles," Takeshita explained in response to a question about the game's genesis.  "He played those for many years. After he joined Capcom, he was always saying that he wanted to make one of those adventure games himself. So when we decided to make this adventure game, we were able to combine some of the elements of PC point-and-click games and also use the Wii remote control motion system and put them together into a sort of action/adventure/puzzle game, which really allows us to create a new experience for players."<br />
<br />
Capcom has no intention of making the game easy-mode, either.  "There are puzzles where, if you don't look properly at the hints in the start, you're going to be in trouble," Takeshita says. "But one of the main ways to play this game is to look at the screen. You have to look at the screen&#8212;all the answers that you need to solve the puzzles are there on the screen. There are some people who say they don't understand the puzzles, but really, they're not paying enough attention. All the answers to the puzzles are right there if you're able to solve them."<br />
<br />
Zack & Wiki is slated to hit North American retail October 16.
