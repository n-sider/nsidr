Okay; maybe not that many, but user "king zell" from Gaming Age Forums has put together the most comprehensive <a href="http://www.ga-forum.com/showthread.php?t=70449">DS line-up</a> we've ever seen.

Everything is there -- from <i>Super Princess Peach</i> to <i>Tottoko Hamtaro Ham Ham Q</i> (don't ask), so it's definately worth a once-over. Just don't be surprised if a few favorites don't make it out before your 80th birthday -- some of these aren't even in the pipeline, yet.
