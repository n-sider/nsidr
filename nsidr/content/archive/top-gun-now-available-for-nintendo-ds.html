<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-05-04-topgunnintendods.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="Top Gun now on Nintendo DS">Top Gun is now available on <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=180125">Nintendo DS</a> for $29.99.  Top Gun currently has a 40 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/928414.asp?q=top%20gun">GameRankings.com</a> (based on one review).  More info can be found on the game's official <a href="http://www.mastiff-games.com/">website</a>.</p>

<p>Top Gun is inspired by the movie of the same name.  It allows players to jump into the cock-pit of an F-14, F/A-18 or F-16 and take to the skies for some dogfighting action in 11 locations.  The game also offers multiplayer for up to three players using a local wireless connection.</p>

Nintendo Power says (4/10),<br>
"Only scattered remnants of the movie remain - one might catch snippets of the theme music or some reference to Ice Man or Maverick, but that's about it.  The game also tries to adhere loosely to the movie's main plot points, such as by letting you play as the wingman in a dogfight or protect a disabled navy ship.  But the gameplay is so simplified and dull that after a few minutes in the cockpit I was ready to crash into a nearby mountain."
