<p>Via Joystiq, news has arrived that <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000663066819/">you can buy a floating NES on eBay</a>.  Well, to be more accurate, it floats if you tie it up with the included fishing line.</p>

<p>(Sorry, readers, but it's a slow news morning so far  at least until the guys on the West Coast wake up and bring <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/">NintendoWifi.com</a>  up for real.)</p>
