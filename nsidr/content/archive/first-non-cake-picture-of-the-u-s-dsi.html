Doubtless you have seen many major media outlets showing you pictures of the lovely cakes they have a received with their review DSi units.  But here, today, as a <i>world exclusive</i>, we present to you the first media review DSi (that we know of) that did not come with an enclosed cake!<br />

Of course, it wasn't <i>just</i> the retail packaging that we got.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />

Inside the nondescript white shipping box was this delightful outer packaging:<br />

Upon opening it, I was treated to strains of applause!  That shiny thing is a mirror with which I can reflect my ugly mug.<br />

I am the star of my Nintendo DSi, it says.  This rings true with what Satoru Iwata said in <a href="http://www.nintendodsi.com/iwataasks/vol4_page1.html">the final volume</a> of his Iwata Asks about the DSi; the "i" stands for personalization.<br />
<br />
We'll have voluminous coverage of the DSi&#8212;a positively <i>huge</i> feature&#8212;coming up as soon as we can get it up, so stay tuned! In the meantime, if you have any questions about the system, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=40&view=contact">send them my way</a>, and I'll do my best to answer!
