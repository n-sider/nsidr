Nintendo UK and Dogs trust, the UK's largest dog welfare charity, have partnered for the release of Nintendogs for the Nintendo DS.  Dogs Trust and Nintendo hope the game will encourage potential dog owners to test their ability to care for a dog before making the commitment to own one.  The Dogs Trust partnership will see joint through-the-line marketing activities taking place from August to December including on-pack branding and fund raising initiatives.

"Dogs Trust is pleased to be associated with 'nintendogs'," said Adrian Burder, Dogs Trust Marketing Director.  "The philosophy behind the game has a lot in common with our own aims of ensuring that every dog is a happy and loved pet. Despite the fame of our A Dog is For Life slogan, thousands of dogs are still abandoned and unwanted every year, so it's great that there's a game that is not only fun to play, but supports the message that responsible dog ownership means more than giving your dog an occasional stroke."
