<p>From <a href="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/694/694807p1.html">IGN</a> comes the report that Nintendo is adding a Player's Choice line to its expansive Game Boy Advance library. This moniker has previously been applied to high-selling titles as far back as the SNES and Game Boy Classic days, and is a welcome addition as they are generally re-issued at a much lower price-point.</p>

<p>The series will make its debut on April 2nd with <i>Mario and Luigi: Supertar Saga</i>, <i>Super Mario Advance</i> and <i>Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3</i> leading the way, all priced at a generous $19.99 (MSRP).</p>

<p>Stay tuned to N-Sider for more as it develops.</p>
