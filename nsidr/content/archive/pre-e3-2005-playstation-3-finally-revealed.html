<p>Earlier today, Sony officially unveiled it's next generation console. Unsurprisingly, the system is officially named the PlayStation 3, or PS3. The company announced a vague launch window of Spring 2006 (which will likely be the Japanese release); however, a price point has yet to be set.

<p>Sony confirmed the usage of Blue-ray discs as the PS3's media format. The discs can hold up to six times as much data as current-generation DVDs. In addition, the machine will be backward compatible all the way to the original PlayStation, will have slots for Memory Stick Duo, SD cards, and a compact flash memory slot. There is also a slot for a detachable 2.5-inch HDD. The PS3 will also be able to support up to seven, yes seven, Bluetooth controllers out of the box and will have six USB slots for peripherals: four slots in the front, and two in the back. The system even supports 1080p, progressive scan, for all of you gamers with fancy High Definition televisions.

<p>Finally, the PS3 will be online enabled. From what we've heard and seen thus far, the system is basically a much more powerful version of the PS2. However, for the first time in the history of the brand, Sony has really tinkered around with the design of the PS3 controller. Though, functionally it will remain nearly identical.
