On Friday, Bethesda announced <i>Star Trek: Conquest</i> for Wii&mdash;inexplicably priced $10 above the $20 version for Sony's PlayStation 2, something consumers are not used to seeing as Wii game prices are generally in-line with last-generation titles.<br />
<br />
The strategy/action hybrid set in the Next Generation era offers players the change to play as Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Cardassian, Dominion, or Breen on a mission to conquer the galaxy.  Wii controls include using the pointer to click one's way through the interface as well as using the Nunchuk to manuever and Remote to fire in combat.<br />
<br />
Conquest is set for release this holiday season, and is not yet rated by the ESRB.
