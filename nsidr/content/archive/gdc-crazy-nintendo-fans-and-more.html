<p>More various tidbits coming out of the Game Developer's conference...

<p><ul>

<li>Via <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/">Wired Games Blog</a> a crazy man is standing outside the Game Developers Conference convention center holding up a sign that reads, "Iwata Drop the Bomb."  Take a look <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/Photo_032306_001.jpg">here</a>, if you dare.

<br><br>
<li>In case we can't keep up, <a href="http://revolution.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=6475">Advanced Media Network</a> will be transcribing the speech live from the keynote.  It's but 30 minutes away.  <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/">IGN.com</a> will also have a transcript shortly after the event.  N-Sider will keep you posted.
