<i>Rune Factory Frontier</i> arrived today, and I got to spend my first game week in Raguna's new digs in the town of Trampoli.  Immediately, I noticed how absolutely beautiful the whole thing was.  Winding paths go everywhere in town, from area to area; I got a little lost more than a few times before I figured out the town's layout.  It's a great feeling.<br />
<br />
<i>Frontier</i> controls with either a Classic Controller or a Remote/Nunchuk combo.  If you choose the latter, you'll be able to optionally shake the Remote for tool or weapon use; shaking the Nunchuk is amusingly mapped only to "knock on door"&mdash;something that doesn't seem to have an equivalent with the Classic Controller, but I don't know that it's important, as knocking on doors isn't getting me anywhere until I become better friends with the townsfolk anyway.  There isn't any awkward forced motion-control that I've seen, which is good; but there aren't any pointer controls for menus either, which is rather annoying.  Apart from that, the Nunchuk combo feels the best to me, if only because I can set my hands apart.<br />

Things seem to be progressing faster than I recall from previous <i>Rune Factory</i> entries.  Money's easier to come by (weeds are worth 10 gold now!) and I'd only been in town days before I was able to buy all the weapons&mdash;which I have used in a couple rooms of the first dungeon, and they seem to handle somewhere in-between <i>Rune Factory</i>'s occasionally-awkward control and <i>Rune Factory 2</i>'s massively improved combat schemes.<br />
<br />
For tools, I've only got my hands on the cheap hoe, watering can, and hammer thus far.  Targeting them is troublesome without the precision of a d-pad (you must use analog sticks for movement), but I expect it to be less of an issue when I'm able to charge them.  I don't yet know when or from where my next tools and upgrades will be coming (and in particular, I don't yet have the tool to deal with the ubiquitous floating Runeys), but I have discovered a new purpose for the hammer: removing fruit from trees.  Just whack the ground, or if you're feeling particularly arbor-abusive, the tree itself.<br />
<br />
There've been little bits of story thus far which I'll let new players discover for themselves, but I've already run into several of the eligible girls from the original <i>Rune Factory</i>, and more are promised.  I'm looking forward to getting deeper into the game, though I've also got <i>Avalon Code</i> and <i>Marble Saga Kororinpa</i> to tackle as well&mdash;so  I might just have to wait a bit to get much further.  Thus far, I'm quite happy to be getting into this new adventure.
