The real news is what they're offering the Platinum members&mdash;which is practically everyone this year, as many long-owned and long-registered games (such as <i>Super Mario 64 DS</i>) were grandfathered in when the service launched late last year.<br />
<br />
Japan's Platinum gifts have been a source of envy for many a year and were behind the calls for Nintendo to bring the service worldwide.  2007 was particularly awesome, giving members a choice of a two-disc <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> soundtrack or a Super-Famicom-styled Wii Classic Controller.  Last year was a little less-than-thrilling, offering Japanese Platinum members a Mario hat or a gold-painted Wii Wheel.<br />
<br />
That same Mario hat is now available to North American Club Nintendo Platinum members, along with what is I suppose <i>sort of</i> cool but still smells a little like a cop-out: a downloadable (presumably WiiWare) single-bout version of <i>Punch-Out!!</i> featuring Doc Louis.<br />
<br />
Well, there's always next year, right?
