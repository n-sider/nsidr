<p>N-Sider has learned that <a href="http://www.rikai.com/perl/LangMediator.En.pl?mediate_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fnamco%2Dch%2Enet%2F">Namco</a> has three titles planned for Wii.  The first is dubbed Final Haron and categorized under the "racing" genre.  The other two lack titles but fall into the genres of Action and RPG. Thanks to N-Sider reader <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=3255">Samer</a> for the heads-up.  We'll bring you more as we learn it.</p>
