Independent game developer Metanet Software, creators of N+, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14077">will be bringing</a> their Independent Game Festival Audience Award winner to the Nintendo DS and PSP in the fall.<br />
<br />
N+ puts players in the shoes of a ninja hunting for gold. Taking cues from Lode Runner, the physics-heavy platformer will be upgraded for its new homes away from the internet. The original game, N, is Flash-based and is still available to <a href="http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/n.html">play online</a>.  In January, Metanet had previously announced that a version would be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.<br />
<br />
N+ is being published by Atari, and development by Silverbirch Studios, who are promising "new features and graphics."
