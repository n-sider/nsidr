<p>Unlike <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1303">Peter Moore</a>, Xbox VP J. Allard has mostly negative commentary concerning the Revolution controller in a recent <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200510/N05.1005.1820.37210.htm">interview with Game Informer</a>.</p>

<p>In the interview, Allard first claims to have pitched a similar idea to developers, only to meet with a decidedly lukewarm response:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Allard:] And there wasnt that much enthusiasm around it. Maybe Nintendo will be more persuasive and have more ideas in first party than we did and that will take off. I dont think thats the way youre going to play FIFA. I dont think its the way youre going to play Madden. I dont think its the way youre going to play racing games. I think the traditional controller for traditional categories is really going to be what drives that. I dont think most Electronic Arts games are going to be played with that thing. I think theyre going to be designed for the classic controller.</p></blockquote>

<p>Allard also spends time bemoaning the lack of buttons, specifically because he doesn't see it working with multimedia functionality:</p>

<blockquote><p>I dont know if I like the implementation because it aint my remote. How am I going to watch a movie on Revolution? Am I going to have a different remote than that or am I going to have to use the four colored buttons?</p></blockquote>
