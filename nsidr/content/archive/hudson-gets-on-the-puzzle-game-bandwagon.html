<a href="http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20060221/sudoku.htm">Game Watch Japan</a> has learned that Hudson Soft will release three casual puzzle titles for the Nintendo DS.  These include Sudoku, Crossword and JigSawPuzzle.  Players will be able to use their stylus to control the on-screen puzzle action.  No word yet on a North American release.
