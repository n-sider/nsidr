2K Games has unveiled its E3 lineup. Unfortunately, only one game has been announced for Nintendo platforms. Fortunately, however, it's an original game from Sid Meier's popular Civilization series.<br />
<br />
<i>Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution</i> will make its official debut at E3, and is heading for both the DS and Wii, as well as the 360 and PS3. Developer Firaxis Games promises a faster-paced game than fans are accustomed to, but it will still be a Civilization game at its core. If that sounds undesirable, fans can at least take solace in Sid Meier's own words: "This is the game I've always wanted to make."<br />
<br />
All versions of the game are slated for Spring 2008, except the Wii version, which is anticipating a Fall 2008 release.<br />
<br />
As always, 2K's E3 lineup is not set in stone, and there could very well be some unannounced titles at the show.
