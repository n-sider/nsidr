<P>The weekly system sales charts from Japan come to us via <a href="http://www.the-magicbox.com">The Magicbox</a>.
<P>
  1. Nintendo DS - 106,081 [316,259] units<br>
   2. PSP - 30,657 [259,371] units<br>
   3. PlayStation 2 - 24,580 [170,677] units<br>
   4. GameBoy Advance SP - 5,946 [41,283] units<br>
   5. GameBoy Micro - 3,042 [25,854] units<br>
   6. GameCube - 3,036 [26,414] units<br>
   7. Xbox 360 - 1,976 [19,176] units<br>
   8. GameBoy Advance - 179 [1,212] units<br>
   9. Xbox - 128 [486] units </P>
<P>The sales of Nintendo DS are up almost 50% from last week's total of 64,515 units, while the PSP lost nearly 8,000 units from last week.  Of note as well: sales of the XBox 360 have fallen almost in half since last week: maybe all the Japanese males who wanted bouncy boobies picked up DOA4 already.  Other systems took almost uniformly small hits from last week's totals.</P>

<P>Again, the DS is playing the dominating role in the Japanese videogame market.</P>
