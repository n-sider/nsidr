<p>According to an article by the New York Times, Nintendo Co., Ltd. president Satoru Iwata has said the Nintendo DS will cost under $200. Furthermore, Shigeru Miyamoto told the Times that some of the features of the handheld were left out to keep costs down.  One such feature may have been to include a tilt sensor for gyroscopic control.</p>
