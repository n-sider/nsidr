In an <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/geometrywarsgalaxies/news.html?sid=6171537&tag=topslot;title;1">interview with Gamespot</a>, <i>Geometry Wars: Galaxies</i> producer Roger Carpenter revealed some choice details regarding how the game will work. Much of it reiterates what <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2799">we already learned</a> from Nintendo Power, but some it does contain some new information.<br />
<br />
There will be various options for control on both the DS and Wii, according to Carpenter, but he cited one specific example for each. On the Wii, players can use the nunchuck to control the movement of the ship and then use the Wii remote to aim. The DS sports a similar option, where the D-pad is used for movement and touching the screen replaces the remote as an aiming instrument.<br />
<br />
Nothing new was revealed about the multiplayer mode, but he did confirm its existence. The Wii version will be played with both players on one screen, while the DS version will be played via local wireless.<br />
<br />
Carpenter also says that despite the obvious difference between the DS and Wii, Bizarre Creations and Kuju are aiming to create one game that will work well on both systems, rather than two distinctly different games. They also plan to have some sort of reward for players who purchase both versions of the game. "As far as I know, it's pushing the link between the two systems further than any other game out there," said Carpenter. What exactly that means is anyone's guess, but it's one of the few hints of any developer utilizing DS-to-Wii connectivity.<br />
<br />
The Wii version will even use said connectivity if players don't own the DS version. Players can download a temporary copy of the original Xbox Live game, <i>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</i>, to a DS using the Wii. An option will also be available in the DS version to send the same demo to friends via local wireless.<br />
<br />
Both the Wii and DS version of Geometry Wars: Galaxies are currently set to release well before the Christmas season.
