<H3>The N-Sider Files Volume #1</H3>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/nsiderfileslogo.jpg" ALIGN="right">Welcome to the first edition of the N-Sider Files. This new feature is where fact and speculation meet for a detailed look at the latest happenings in the world of Nintendo. In our first issue we discuss Metroid 4, Intelligent System's Future, Nintendo's first party studios, and Shin Megami Tensei.

<p><b>The Minds behind Metroid 4</b>

<p>When development of a new Metroid for the Game Boy Advance was announced, several Metroid enthusiasts and the more traditional loyalists were thrilled to see a second, and most importantly 2D Metroid title from Nintendo. As highly welcomed as the idea of a <i>Metroid 4</i> title was, its E3 debut has sparked a lot of controversy and questions we would like to share our information on it. 

<p><i>Is Retro Studios developing Metroid 4?</i><br>While Metroid Prime is being developed in Texas by the Nintendo funded upstart Retrostudios, Metroid 4 is being developed inhouse in Japan. 

<p><i>So Intelligent Systems is developing Metroid 4?</i><br> We are sure the title is being developed inhouse at Nintendo Company Limited without the aid of Intelligent Systems. For the record, Intelligent Systems was only involved in programming the Super NES incarnation of the title in conjunction with R&D1's designers and artists. The primary reason being the R&D1 team's programmers had few resources to spare on any outside of Game Boy project at the time,  however the true creators are at R&D1. More specifially, we have on good authority that the majority of the <i>Wario Land 4</i> team is in charge of the title. 

<p><i>Why did the game look so early at E3?</i>
<br>Like we mentioned before, we believe R&D1 was developing <i>Wario Land 3, Legendary Starfi,</i> and <i>Metroid 4</i> for the <b>Game Boy Color</b> simultaneously sometime in late 1999/2000. Apparently, sometime in 2000 the decision was made to drop all internal GBC projects and switch them to the Game Boy Advance. <i>Wario Land 3</i> was the only game released, while <i>Legendary Starfi</i> was bumped to GBA. We feel strongly that <i>Metroid 4</i> was in development at the time, and like <i>Legendary Starfi</i> bumped to the GBA last minute. That is why we believe the early E3 footage was a very unoptimized state of transition from the GBC to GBA conversion.

<p>One thing obvious from the <i>Metroid 4</i> E3 footage, is that it's definitely pushing the envelope as the fourth installment of the epic. Most importantly, all the Metroids can't be extinct when there is one inside of you.

<p><b>Intelligent Systems 200X</b>

<p>While the group has been working on Game Boy Advance titles, we are positive the team does have one GameCube project in the works. Specifically, Toshiyuki Nakamura and the Paper Mario team have gone unaccounted for thus far. We expect the development team is working on Intelligent System's first GameCube title, knowing Nakamura's background, it's very likely this till be an original title of some sort.

<p>Meanwhile Toru Narihiro and most of his <i>Advance Wars</i> team are moving on to finish development on <i>Fire Emblem</i>. Not too much of a surprise considering both games use the same battle engine. Many are still worried about how the new <i>Fire Emblem</i> will turn out with the departure of Shouzo Kaga. While Shouzo Kaga created the series, and has indeed left Intelligent Systems, much of the team remains intact. Toru Narihiro, the Chief Director of Operations at Intelligent Systems, has taken over the project. Narihiro was one of the creators of the <i>Wars</i> franchise, and has supervised and produced all Intelligent Systems titles so he should have no problem filling in his shoes with the rest of the FE team.

<p>We realistically expect to see possible GameCube incarnations of the <i>Wars</i> and <i>Fire Emblem</i> series sometime in 2003 and 2004. 

<p><b>Inside NdSTCUBE</b>
<p>With the coming new year upon us, several projects brew inside Nintendo's inhouse facility in Kyoto. What about Nintendo's two other main internal prefectures? We know both facilities were actually established with the idea of expanding internal R&D with the Nintendo brand. Both studios are 85% composed of first time game developers straight out of college. Both studios also house several Chief Directors once employed at NCL; Nintendo Software Technology's Shigeki Yamashiro was a designer on the original <i>Wave Race</i> and <i>Wave Race 64</i> before moving to Redmond, WA to work on <i>Ridge Racer 64</i> and <i>Wave Race: Blue Storm</i>.

<p>As we reported earlier, both studios have both GameCube and Game Boy Advance titles slated for 2002. Though we don't know what the titles are, looking at the developers latest titles it seems like a sure bet we will see more updates to past Nintendo Company Limited franchises. With <i>Wave Race: Blue Storm, Pokemon Puzzle League, F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,</i> and <i>Yakuman Advance</i> serving as history, could the future see a <i>Kid Icarus, Pilotwings, Punchout</i> or even a new <i>Mach Rider</i>?

<p>While many questioned why Nintendo has delegated its studios to a predictable line of software, take into consideration this is Nintendo's method of training the studios until the designers become self-sufficient. Furthermore, both developers run on very streamlined projects, meaning most of them are developed in a shorter than usual time span with a very moderate budget; interestingly enough the opposite philosophy initiated and soon eradicated at Retro Studios.

<p><b>Shin Megami Tensei on Cube ?</b>

<p><b>Atlus</b><br>Fact: Atlus has pledged support to the Nintendo GameCube. While no specific software has been named, Mr. Okada from R&D1 has confirmed the group is working on a secret RPG for the platform.<br><br>Speculation: Mr. Okada and his R&D1 group have two flagship RPG franchises, <i>Megami Tensei (Devil Summoner)</i> and <i>Shin Megami Tensei (Persona)</i>. While <i>Megami Tensei Online</i> has been confirmed for the XBOX, the <i>Shin Megami Tensei (Persona)</i> franchise is still a possible candidate for the GameCube platform. Mr. Okada has been adamant about producing the franchise for the Game Boy Advance, and was once rumored to bring the franchise to the 64DD. Cross your fingers when Atlus officially announces the title sometime in the first half of 2002.
