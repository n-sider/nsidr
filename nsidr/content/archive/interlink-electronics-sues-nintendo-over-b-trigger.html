Interlink Electronics, Inc., makers of hardware primarily intended to help businessfolk deliver always-informative and unfailingly-interesting PowerPoint presentations, have <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6162912.html">brought suit against Nintendo</a>, claiming the B trigger on the underside of the Remote infringes on a patent they hold on a similarly-shaped device.<br />

The patent, numbered 6,850,221 and titled "Trigger Operated Electronic Device", appears to cover a device that has little in common with the Wii Remote other than general shape and, of course, the trigger on the underside.  Interlink is seeking a trial to determine damages in the form of "loss of reasonable royalties, reduced sales and/or lost profits as a result of the infringing activities".  As Wii and Interlink's products are in entirely different markets, it seems to this reporter that such a determination may not fall in Interlink's favor.
