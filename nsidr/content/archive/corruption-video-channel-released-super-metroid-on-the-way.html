Those who would claim that Nintendo has no intention of promoting the upcoming release of <i>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</i> are eating their words today as Nintendo overnight unveiled a direct-to-consumer promotional plan for the title, all downloadable through the Wii Shop Channel.<br />
<br />
First, and available right now, is the Metroid Prime 3 Preview Channel.  This free download takes a scant 70 blocks, primarily because it is a video viewer and a simple Flash-type "uncover the picture" activity.  As of today, two videos are available on the channel, and both stream from the Internet.<br />
<br />
Coming in the next two weeks as well are Virtual Console releases from the Metroid Series.  Next week will see the release of the original NES <i>Metroid</i>, which is admittedly something Metroid fans might not be so interested in, as it's shown up on the original <i>Metroid Prime</i> for GameCube, as a NES Classic release for Game Boy Advance, and both remade and in its original form on <i>Metroid: Zero MIssion</i> for Game Boy Advance.  However, a week after that, on the 20th, the oft-clamored-for <i>Super Metroid</i> will be available on the Virtual Console.<br />
<br />
The news of the Preview Channel's release was announced via yet another Message Board message from "Nintendo".  Whether Nintendo plans to continue releasing previews and demos in this fashion is unknown.
