<div class="box">Tell us a little bit about the game's story and tone.  I've found it rather humorous; is that true to the original?  It feels like a natural fit.</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Mark MacDonald, Executive Director, 8-4, Ltd.:</span>Yep, the original Japanese has the same kind of lighthearted and playful tone throughout. We did play up certain elements and add a few character traits here and there, but the overall story definitely reflects the mood of the original. Glad you liked it!</div></div><br />
<div class="box">We heard that there were some changes made for the U.S. release to make <i>Heracles</i> a better game, particularly in the area of battle speed.  Can you elaborate on those changes?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Nishimura:</span>Here in Japan, along with high evaluations, we received some requests that the gameplay should have been speedier.<br />
We sincerely considered that feedback and added some improvements including skipping the effect animation during combat, instant access for frequently-used commands, and better gameplay interface. We hope the game is now more enjoyable for Western players with these improvements.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">What sort of person would be interested in <i>Glory of Heracles</i>?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">MacDonald:</span>I think any RPG fan looking for something a bit different would appreciate <i>Heracles</i>&mdash;it's a nice change of pace from the all the super-serious, Lord of the Rings-type fantasy tales out there. And really, that goes for anyone looking to get lost in an interesting story on your DS, RPG fan or not.</div></div><br />

<div class="box">Do you see a future in continuing the series here as it sees a revival in Japan?  I suppose that has a lot to do with how well it performs, of course.</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Nishimura:</span>Of course the performance is important, as one of the elements to make decisions. We would like to consider continuing our discussion based on the experience we built during the development of this title, but we are unsure at this point whether if the next installment is going to be a part of series or takes different forms. We are looking forward to your support!</div></div><br />
<div class="box">I have to say that I've been particularly enjoying the 8-4 localization; it's been quite entertaining and definitely up to the standard I expect from of a Nintendo-published game.  You did <i>Baten Kaitos Origins</i> too, I remember, which I also really enjoyed.  I hope Nintendo continues to use you for projects like this.  I know that's not a question, but...</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">MacDonald:</span>No, no, I think it's an excellent question! In fact, I propose you make this the first question in every interview you do from now on.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">Is there anything else you'd like to say?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">MacDonald:</span>I just want to say thanks to you guys at N-Sider for your coverage of <i>Heracles</i>. A lot of positive word-of-mouth about the game has built up thanks to people like you, and it's especially gratifying when anyone recognizes what a difference a good story and quality localization can make.</div></div><br />
<i>Glory of Heracles</i> has been available for Nintendo DS since January 18.  It's a fun game and&mdash;as Mr. MacDonald said&mdash;definitely a nice change of pace from traditional fantasy.  Fans of both entertaining story and unique battle systems should check it out.
