When Nintendo releases or publishes an RPG in the States, my default position is "sit up and take notice."  So it was with <i>Glory of Heracles</i>, the latest entry in a revived series that has had a bit of a history in Japan on the Famicom, Super Famicom and Game Boy, originally a Data East property but bought up by oft-Nintendo-partner Paon, where a number of the former Data Easters had gone.<br />
<br />
<i>Glory of Heracles</i> was brought to Japanese players first in 2008, then shown at E3 last year and released a few months ago here.  I found myself enjoying its world, story, script (localized by the team at 8-4, who are fast becoming one of my favorites), and the unique way in which its battle system works; so I pitched some questions Nintendo-ward about the game which NCL producer Kentaro Nishimura and 8-4 executive director Mark MacDonald were kind enough to answer.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
<div class="box">Thanks for taking the time to talk <i>Glory of Heracles</i> with us today.Â  Let's start off with a bit of history: this is the first time the series has seen the light of day in the West, but the series has been running since 1987 on the Famicom, I understand.Â  Can you talk a little bit about its history?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Kentaro Nishimura, Assistant Producer, NCL:</span>Sure. It was in 1987 when <i>Tojin Makyo Den: Heracles no Eiko</i>, the first title of the <i>Glory of Heracles</i> series, was released for NES in Japan. The following sequels including <i>Heracles no Eiko II: Titan no Metsubo</i> for NES in 1992, <i>Heracles no Eiko III: Kamigami no Chinmoku</i> for SNES in 1994, and <i>Heracles no Eiko IV: Kamigami kara no Okurimono</i> were released in Japan.  <i>[Editor's note: We think something was mixed up in translation here; as far as we know, <i>Heracles II</i> released in 1989, <i>III</i> in 1992, and <i>IV</i> in 1994 for the Super Famicom.]</i><br />
<br />
It is our great honor to deliver <i>Glory of Heracles</i>, or the fifth <i>Heracles no Eiko</i> in Japan, to people in North America for the first time!</div></div><br />

<div class="box">What made Nintendo decide that now was the time to bring this series stateside?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Nishimura:</span>As the demographic of the Nintendo DS user varies so much, we believe we have to deliver varied kinds of games accordingly. <br />
<br />
Even though we do not have a large number of RPGs at Nintendo, we have a huge amount of RPG fans among our customers. Considering the balance of our software library, we decided to release this game at this time.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">For me, personally, what generally draws me to an RPG is its battle system.Â  I've had some time with <i>Heracles</i> now, and have been playing it on and off since launch.Â  It seems to me to be an edge innovator, taking tried and true turn-based systems and doing new things around the edges.Â  What sorts of things do you think sets Heracles apart in this regard?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Nishimura:</span>I think it is the idea of Front Row and Rear Row, which the series has been applying since the first title.<br />
<br />
I believe it sets <i>Glory of Heracles</i> apart from general RPGs where you have no idea of plural rows or distances and characters are standing in one same row.<br />
<br />
For this title, we have expanded the idea into a more strategic system where you can more effectively advance by considering positions of characters, formation of your party, magic spells, and a combination among them. It might be more similar to SRPG than general RPGs. This title is a natural fusion of the two.</div></div>
