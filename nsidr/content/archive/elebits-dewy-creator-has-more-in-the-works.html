Konami's Shingo Mukaitoge, producer of <i>Elebits</i> and the just-released <i>Dewy's Adventure</i>, sat down with Revogamers at the Games Convention this year and gave <a href="http://www.revogamers.net/articulos-186-Shingo-Mukaitoge-responde-sobre-Dewy-y-Elebits-4.html">an interview</a>.  Perhaps most importantly, especially to those worried about Mukaitoge continuing to produce games after Dewy's reportedly poor showing in Japan, is this exchange:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote"><b>Revogamers:</b> ... This, <i>[Zack & Wiki]</i>, [and] <i>Mario Galaxy</i> seem to be what we call a Wii-feeling game, which is something that combines clever use of the Wiimote and ground up design and gameplay. Are we seeing more games like this from your studio?<br />
<br />
<b>Mukaitoge:</b> Yes, definitely.</div><br />
The interviewer also asks about the difficulty level Dewy presents (Mukaitoge responds, "I think it's a [somewhat] difficult game. If you try again and again, then you will be really good at controlling it and you will find it very enjoyable. So trying again and again is the point.") and  inquires about Mukaitoge's favorite project on Wii, to which he replies, "Oh, has it to be Wii? Not Wii, but the game I [am] really looking for is the DS Zelda. I think [it] is perfect."<br />
<br />
Dewy's Adventure released to North American retail yesterday and should be available in a store near you&#8212;soon if not now.
