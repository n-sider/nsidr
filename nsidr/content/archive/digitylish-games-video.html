Nintendo of Europe has released a video for the first part of the <i>Digitylish</i> Game Boy Advance series of games, according to Game-Science.com. The titles shown in the video include Dialhex, Neopong, Dotliner, Digidrive and Coloris (these five titles were trademarked earlier in the year by Nintendo alongside the names Orbital, Sneakout, Sojourner, Swimworm and T-Typo).  <i>Digitylish</i> was showcased at the past Electronic Entertainment Expo as a collection of simple, colorful, and stylized games.  It is unknown if they will release on a single cartridge or sold separately, however they are rumored to release alongside the Game Boy micro later this year.
