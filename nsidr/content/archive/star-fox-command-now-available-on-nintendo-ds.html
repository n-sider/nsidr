"Star Fox Command might offer a new and different experience, but along with some key gameplay and presentation elements the feel of the classic SNES game is intact. The stylus controls might still need some work but the core idea is sound, with accuracy and precision that previous Star Fox games - and air combat titles in general - just never offered before."

"Star Fox Command has great controls and introduces a strategic layer that's fairly interesting. However, the random feel of the story battles and the frantic multiplayer mode don't make the most of this game's solid foundation, which might cause nostalgic fans to long for the series' good old days. Fortunately, Star Fox Command still has a lot of good qualities going for it, so anyone looking for an original, portable flight combat game should set their sights on this one."

"Star Fox Command isn't a return to the glory days or a flawless project that redefines the series, but it's a solid and interesting title that takes on new ideas and comes up with something entirely worthwhile. The flight-jockey animals and the resulting serious but silly drama may not click with people who didn't grow up with the series, but the gameplay speaks for itself. The game takes on more responsibilities than simply blasting enemies, and asks players to do so as well."
