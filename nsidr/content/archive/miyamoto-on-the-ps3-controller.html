<p>After Nintendo UK head honcho's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2179">commentary on Sony's controller</a> for the PlayStation 3, which incorporates basic motion-sensing technology, EAD senior managing director and general manager <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>'s considerably more diplomatic <a href="http://wham.canoe.ca/news/2006/05/20/1590245-sun.html">commentary</a> on the same issue has surfaced, courtesy <cite>The Toronto Sun</cite>.</p>

<p>"It's kind of what always seems to happen," Miyamoto said.  "But the fact that they looked at what we were doing and decided it was a good path is kind of flattering; it kind of reinforces in our minds that we're doing the right thing.</p>

<p>"What they've done is just take your standard controller and add in this motion-sensing device &mdash; that's similar to what we did back on the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=8">Game Boy Color</a> many years ago. Maybe if they were to completely copy and go with a remote and a nunchuk and two motion sensors, I might be a little more concerned. But I don't think they're anywhere close to that."</p>
