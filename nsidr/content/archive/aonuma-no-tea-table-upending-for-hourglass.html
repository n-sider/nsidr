In an E3 interview with Wired's Chris Kohler, Zelda honcho Eiji Aonuma noted that EAD general manager and all-around Nintendo rock star Shigeru Miyamoto broke with his usual tradition and completely failed to "upend the tea-table"&mdash;referring to his penchant for sending a team scrambling back to the drawing board&mdash;when he first checked out the team's progress on <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>.<br />

<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Eiji Aonuma</span>This is a first for the Zelda franchise, but Miyamoto actually didn't "upend the tea table" even once. I was really surprised. After we were almost done with the game, Miyamoto played it. I was bracing myself for the worst, but instead he said, "This is good!" And I was like: "...wha?" And it was probably because, for the four months prior, I myself had been upending various smaller tea tables.</div></div><br />
<a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/07/e3-interview--2.html">The interview</a> covers a wide range of topics, including the genesis of Phantom Hourglass itself, the news that Aonuma's team is looking at new ideas on both Wii and DS, and a polite acknowledgement that yes, Chris Kohler <i>does</i> want Four Swords on DS&mdash;without any commitment to actually make said title.<br />

Phantom Hourglass is already out in Japan and hits North America this October.
