Nintendo has launched the official <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/azej/index.html">Japanese website</a> for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>, and with it come a bevy of gameplay videos.<br />
<br />

  <li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/azej/penaction/index.html">Basic movement</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/azej/penaction/02.html">Sword combat</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/azej/penaction/03.html">Boomerang control</a></li>
  </ul><br />
There are three other sections of the site that are still locked away, sure to be opened progressively as the title's Japanese release date approaches.<br />
<br />
Phantom Hourglass hits Japanese shores in a scant 10 days, and is set to arrive in North America later this year.
