Nintendo of Europe has announced the addition of four titles to their edition of the Wii Shop Channel's retro Virtual Console service.  The titles are as follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Streets of Rage 2</i> (Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>ToeJam and Earl in Panic on Funkotron</i> (Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Kid Chameleon</i> (Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>World Sports Competition</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
The titles are live and available now.  Of these titles, World Sports Competition has not previously seen release on the North American VC, and Panic on Funkotron hasn't yet seen release&mdash;but should soon, based on its appearance in Nintendo Power.<br />
<br />
<b>Update:</b>  The above story was updated on 6/4.  Previously, there was some confusion about Panic on Funkotron's North American status.  We apologize for the error.
