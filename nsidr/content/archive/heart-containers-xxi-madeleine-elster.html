<h3>[06.20] XXI - Madeleine Elster</h3><P>Can you at all possibly believe that on my first column back from a three-month hiatus I received the largest number of letters in the history of Heart Containers?  At least I'm pretty sure this is the most.  FOURTEEN LETTERS for christsakes!  And most of them are actually funny, completely going against the Heart Containers Way.  Maybe it was the promise of a free swag giveaway that jumpstarted your contributions!</P>

<P>Last week I told you to write in with your best idea for a game that Nintendo would never make.  It's probably the best topic ever.  Nothing gets your creative juices flowing like extreme crossover fantasies!  So, anyway, I'm really glad all you people wrote in.</P>

<P>I think that I need to tell you a story before we start the column though.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Hey you scalleywag!  Stop your scrolling down and read my damned story.</P>
<P>Last night I was sitting here in my room and all of a sudden I was like "hey I really need some Taco Bell" and so I decided that since it was such a nice evening, I'd go for a stroll to the nearest one.  Taco Bells aren't really abundant in central Iowa: "Taco John's" is our (regional) texi-mexi franchise of choice around here.  Their commercials consist of an exploited monkey wearing a cowboy hat riding around on a dog or something.</P>

<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/hearts21tacodog.jpg"></center></p>

<P>...but I digress.  Anyway Taco Bell is only a couple of blocks away so I walk over there and it's not a bad walk but I get there and it's like 10:30 in the evening and only the drive-thru is open.  So I think "whatever" and walk over to the menu thing and of course they don't answer cause I'm not as heavy as a car and the damned thing doesn't trigger.  So I jump on it like I can generate a ton of force or something and I can't so I walk over to the window and the guy comes over to it and I'm like "hey can I just order here" and he's like "no sorry our insurance doesn't let us do that" and I'm like "what?"  And so I say "I'm just gonna walk over to the menu then, and you take my order."  And he's like "sorry I can't do that" and I'm like "so in order to physically get food here, by ordering and then paying you with money, I have to first own a car?"  And he's like "yes" and so I'm like "fuck that" and then I walk back home and take the damned car up there and order and after I ordered I was this goddamned close to parking the car and walking up to the window to get my food.  I mean what the hell could they do?  Not give it to me?  I could just drive my car over the menu and order like thirty-five burritos and then not pay for them cause they wouldn't accept my money.  Those goddamned buttertits I think I'll sue them for discrimination based on income!  WHO'S WITH ME</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Um bad ideas for a Nintendo game.</P>

<P>Nintendo does not make enough games based on movies.
I suggest a game based on the hit film "Sin City".</P>

<P>The definite casting is as follows.</P>

<P>Mario as the Yellow Bastard, Princess Peach as the grown up Nancy, King Koopa as Marv, Luigi as Kevin.  (The cannibal)</P>

<P>All the major scenes of the film will be kept, the language
will remain as well as the violence and blood flow.
As the game progresses you play as the "hero" of that
particular story line.</P>

<P>Gamers at first might feel a tad confused after they finish
cutting off Mario's (Yellow Bastard) genitals, but they will
soon be desensitized by the game's copious amounts of
violence and sex. </P>

<P>I've read your articles often, but never bothered to write in. Maybe
it was sympathy for your lack of emails, maybe it was the allure of a
free Mario Kart stylus, maybe it was sheer boredom- but I'm,
nevertheless, writing in to share with you a horrible idea that you're
sure to love- or perhaps like slightly. Or maybe you'll hate it. You
suck if you hate it. Anyway, here goes, the game Nintendo will never
publish (aside from Stage Debut [haha.. ZING!]): Donkey Kong Porno
Beat. Yeah, that's right, I said it. I know everybody reading this has
made jokes about beating their drums. Well, make a game where you can
beat your drums to some porno and you have the makings of... well, a
very sticky controller. Well, that's the best I could do, aside from
"Megafeetman," which Capcom would have to publish. It's been a
pleasure contributing; have a nice day man.</P>

comedian, living in New York, he has a friend, a neighbor, and an
ex-girlfriend, which is all true.</P>

<P>GEORGE: Yeah, but nothing happens in the game. You see, it's just like life.
You know, you eat, you go shopping, you read.. You eat, you read, You go
shopping.</P>

<P>IWATA: You read? You read in the game?</P>

<P>JERRY: Well, I don't know about the reading.. We didn't discuss the reading.</P>

<P>IWATA: All right, tell me, tell me about the gameplay. What kind of
gameplay?</P>

<P>IWATA: No gameplay? So, what is it?</P>

<P>GEORGE: (Showing an example) What'd you do today?</P>

<P>IWATA: I got up and came to work.</P>

<P>GEORGE: There's a level. That's a level.</P>

<P>IWATA: (Confused) How is that a level?</P>

<P>JERRY: Well, uh, maybe something happens on the way to work.</P>

<P>GEORGE: No, no, no. Nothing happens.</P>

<P>JERRY: Well, something happens.</P>

<P>IWATA: Well, why am I playing it?</P>

<P>GEORGE: Because it's a Nintendo game.</P>

<P>IWATA: (Threatening) Not yet.</P>

<P>GEORGE: Okay, uh, look, if you want to just keep on doing the same old
thing, then maybe this idea is not for you. I, for one, am not going to
compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is
the game and we're not going to change it. (To Jerry) Right?</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Hi Heart Containers</P>

<P>Here's a game that would never be made by Nintendo.</P>

<P>It's called the pokemon talk show game.</P>

<P>Basically, Pikachu (nearly forgotten how to spell
that) is the lead character, and you have to get him
ready by playing a minigame of choosing a suit and
getting your make up done. For a bonus level you could
get to argue with some fly on the wall programme
director while getting ready.</P>

<P>From there, just keep on hitting 'A' so that Pika
keeps on spitting out his catchphrases repeatedly,
leaving a bemused 'celebrity guest' like maybe Bill
Gates to sit around looking puzzled.</P>

<P>You'd win if you managed to reach a point where they
actually gave you a sensible answer.</P>

<P>Ok, that idea sucks, but it was better than my first
idea, which was Mario Cell- Chao Garden Theory. In
that one, the portly plumber has to sneak around
Sonic's castle, trying not to be detected until
finally garotting him as final revenge for the
Nintendo/Sega wars. </P>

<P>Well, actually, my first idea was to say 'Super Mario
in an all new GBA platformer' but that was probably
being a bit too cynical.</P>

<P>Of course, I don't actually have a DS myself, but if I
happen to win the Mario Kart one I could always take
it into GAME, and use it on their display model. Also,
it will cost you big bucks postage all the way over
here to the fine kingdom of England.</P>

<P>So I get the last laugh.</P>

<P>He who laughs last, is the last one to laugh.</P>

<P>I don't have a DS anyways but I could use it for many other fun activities, such as meatball stabbing.
Don't ask.</P>

<P>Anyways, about your question... well seeing as how Mario will be on every sport imaginable in a few years, with Mario table tennis, Mario goat rider and Mario throw-a-rock-in-the-pond-to-see-it-bounce sports games, Its hard to find something that nintendo would say NO.</P>

<P>The mario-gta is an obvious though.  I once read a ranting fanboy writing about how cool would be a mario game where he goes back to brooklin and bowser try to takes over the city.  Sure I can see mario randomly stealing karts and running over koopa troopas and goombas.  Or the princess ordering him to go to X place and kill everybody there because they belong to Daisy's kingdom and they're doing blackmarket with the shrooms.  so you get there and firebal the crap out of everybody, including the random koopa troopa that was just passing by. Oh yeah so many possibilities.</P>

<P>What about a turn based Zelda game?.  or maybe a pokemon where you are a badass mofo and you want to exterminate every pokemon off the face of the earth.   No well that actually would be a blockbuster.  Or a metroid game where samus falls in love with ridley uh? complete with sex scene.</P>

<P>Oh god I have such a sick mind.</P>

idea down the other month, telling me "Nintendo wouldn't make [it] in
a million years.  You:  Brandon, bastard - crusher of all my greatest
dreams.</P>

<P>I think Nintendo would profit handsomely if they designed a first
person shooter with a variety of playable characters, SSB style.  If
they wanted to tone it down a bit, it could be a PAINTBALL game.  Now
come on, how awesome would Mario Paintball be?  Think of the levels! 
The colors!  The mayhem!</P>

<P>I would buy it.  You know what, Brandon?  You are wrong about this
one.  Nintendo WILL make Mario Paintball, mark my WORDS! 
Muahahahahaha!</P>

<P>by the way, i'm sending a package in the mail to you, it involves
oleander caterpillars and several sticks of dynamite.  it's a secret,

<P>PIKMIN 3: BLOODBATH</P>

<P>Having saved his company's fortune with the aid of dim-witted sidekick Louie and made a hefty profit thereafter with the company's president in Pikmin 2, Olimar returns alone to the mysterious planet of the Pimin for a much-deserved vacation. But Olimar's expectations of a warm welcome from the colorful little guys are wrong.</P>

<P>Dead wrong.</P>

<P>Angered by his befriending them, using them, and then abandoning them twice, the Pikmin swarm over Olimar's ship as he's landing and rip him from the cockpit, planning to feed him to an Emperor Bulblax. A lucky escape puts Olimar on the run, hiding stealthily from hordes of evil Pikmin, beginning a search for weapons to take out the fragile, but impossibly numerous creatures, and this time he has to do all the work himself. </P>    </TD>

<b>The Press says:</b> <P><b>Several Pikmin Dead after Vicious Attack in Garden</b></p>

<P>Several Pikmin were found dead this afternoon following an apparent onslaught of rage by their creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. Reportedly, Pikmin of not only the red and yellow varieties, but the blue as well, were harmed or destroyed.</P>

<P>One next-door neighbor spoke candidly to The Press.</P>

<P>"I've never seen him like this before. He was thrashing and flailing about with a bottle in one hand and a Garden Claw in the other. Those poor little Pikmin were flying everywhere. I heard their cute little screams!"</P>

<P>One group was reportedly felled as they attempted communally to carry a large token with the number ten on it back to a large onion-shaped object from which other Pikmin were emerging.</P>

<P>Captain Olimar was unable to be reached for questioning, but stated in a public conference that the incident was "distressing" and that he was unable to be certain that he would ever "repair [his] ship" and "get off of this un-inhabitable planet."</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Dear Heart Container in the barn behind the ranch inside the secret passage blocked by crates on the left,</P>
 
<P>For this weeks topic, you asked for a game that would never get made if presented to "Nintendo people". To be fair, what I came up with after hours of research in my lab was a game that would and has been created by "Sony people" or "Microsoft people", but more likely than not will not be gracing my Gameboy Color anytime in your very short for reasons to be discussed later okay hunny? lifetime.</P>
 
<P>Here's what I wrote to NOA:</P>
 
<P><i>Dear Mario,</P>
 
<P>I had selected the preset "game ideas" for this letter, yet my option to write in was immediately taken away from me. However, this idea for a game is SO good, I cannot possibly let it rest within my brain any longer without donating it to my very favorite game developers. So, my apologies for letting this rest under "Other".</P>
 
<P>Anyway, on to my awesome idea.</p>
 
<P>Basically, this would be a game where you were this dude, and you had guns. Any dude really...just so long as he was "2legit2quit" (that's where the marketing comes in for the sequel), and was able to pick up fly hunnies if so required to. Now this dude's job is to basically kill stuff such like zombies and bears and cops and stuff, with the incentive not to get caught. I'd like to see lots of nudity too, but no wang. I mean, I guess you could give the dude a righteous wang, but we don't have to see it.</P>
 
<P>I haven't really thought of a story for the game, but I know you guys are good with, like, just making some drug inspired names up for towns, making your enemy an evil version of yourself (like in the last three Metroid games), and putting Mario in the game for no reason just for more sales...so just do that. The more cameos the better.</P>
 
<P>Oh, and the dude should be voiced by Emo Phillips too. Yeah, don't forget that.</P>
 
<P>That's pretty much it really...dude, gun, wang, zombies, evil something-or-the-other, and Emo Phillips. Just e-mail me when you finish it. Thanks.</P>
 
<P>-Alan</P></i>
 
<P>Look, all I'm saying is that it's been more than 24 hours now, and I don't see how every effort to get back to me has been taken.</P>

<P>I think everything should be voiced by Emo Phillips.  And in regards to the inclusion of the righteous wang... wouldn't our hero have a righteous bulge.  Nobody needs to see a four-hundred polygon wang bulge.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The prize for next time is going to be this exclusive snowmanny Atlus screencleaner thing with this dude on it:</p>

<P>You're dying for E3 swag and just like last time, all you have to do is send a letter which is on-topic.</p>

<P>The topic for next week is Videogame Movies.  What existing videogames should be made into movies?  Who would direct them?  Who would star in them?  What would they be about?  Don't limit yourselves to the Metroid/Zelda/Final Fantasy realm, either.  Let's really try to get creative here!  My money's on the Ice Climbers movie.  It would be directed by Uwe Boll and would consist of Fiona Apple and Al Roker climbing a mountain and then falling off.</p>

<P>Tell me yours for crap's sake, it'll only take a minute!</P>
