Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> will reveal more information regarding the Nintendo Revolution during his Tokyo Game Show keynote address on September 16, according to Spong.com.  Nintendo has not confirmed this information and so it is still a rumor at this point.
