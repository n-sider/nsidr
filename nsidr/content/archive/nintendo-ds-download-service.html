<p>Nintendo Japan is slowly rolling out its download service for the Japanese Nintendo DS.  The first run of the service will span from February 26 through March 21, according to Game-Science.com. Nintendo DS owners will be able to download demo versions of <i>Chokkan Hitofude</i> and <i>Meteos</i> as well as extra songs for <i>Band Brothers</i> from retailers around Japan.  The game demos are said to remain in memory until the machine is turned off while the Band Brothers songs will be downloaded to the software cartridge permanently.  A list of locations in Japan where the service will be available can be found at Nintendo's official <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/download/shoplist.html">website</a>.</p>
