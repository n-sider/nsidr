Like Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, Kirby GCN (tentative title) is planned as one of the last big Nintendo-developed games on its platform.  In his latest adventure, Kirby sets off to right the wrongs of the nefarious (yet oh-so-cute) King Dedede.  A video of this recently-announced title was shown at the Nintendo Press Conference before E3 and periodically on the large display screen at the back of the Nintendo booth.<br><br>

The E3 video highlights several of Kirby's trademark transformations, from a sword-toting adventurer (Link?) to a water-spitting aqua puff.  Kirby GCN, however, allows the floating pink wonder to release these enemies from his jaws in their original form.  For example, the clip opens with Kirby slicing up a stone golem.  Later in the video, Kirby gives up his stone hat (and its powers) to summon an identical golem.  These released enemies seem to follow Kirby and aid him on his adventure, much like in Kirby Super Star for the SNES.<br><br>

Players in Kirbys multiplayer mode will take the role of Kirby and three companion characters.  Some of these characters, such as the hammer-wielding monkey, are also minor enemies in the first-player mode.  Kirby and his three companions move through side-scrolling environments, helping each other dispose of countless enemies.  <br><br>

While Nintendo has revealed that multiplayer characters can ride piggyback to form a column of pastel justice, this element was not shown in the video.<br><br>

Kirby GCN is being developed by HAL Laboratories and published by Nintendo/HAL Laboratories Inc.
