Reports surfacing this morning reveal that longtime Nintendo advertising agency Leo Burnett has <a href="http://www.mcvuk.com/news/27056/Nintendos-advertising-agency-quits">resigned their account</a> with Nintendo.<br />
<br />
Marketing, media, and PR news site Brand Republic cites insiders claiming Leo Burnett dropped the account because of "increased interference from Japan".  Leo Burnett has been with Nintendo a long time, having <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5D81639F932A25757C0A967958260">won a $25 million contract</a> to launch the Super Nintendo Entertainment System many years back.<br />
<br />
Nintendo UK's marketing director Dawn Paine said the split was due to a "change in business requirements".  The split leaves Nintendo searching for a new agency.
