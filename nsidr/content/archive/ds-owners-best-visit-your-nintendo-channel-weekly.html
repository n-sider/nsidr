If you're a fan of the DS demos on your Wii's <i>Nintendo Channel</i>, consider this your heads-up to check out the channel at least once a week.<br />
<br />
Some demos that debuted with the channel's release, including one for the oft-overlooked but excellent <i>Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword</i>, have already been removed from the service and replaced with others.  Other lost demos include <i>Jam Sessions</i>, <i>Rayman Raving Rabbids 2</i>, <i>Cooking Mama 2: Dinner with Friends</i>, and <i>Disney Friends</i>.  New demos have taken their place include <i>The Spiderwick Chronicles</i>, <i>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</i>, <i>Eco-Creatures: Save the Forest</i>, <i>My Word Coach</i>, and <i>Iron Man</i>&#8212;though all of the above are set to expire on the 18th, just three days away.<br />
<br />
It seems that third party titles are most likely to fall out of rotation; Nintendo's own <i>Brain Age</i> line as well as <i>Flash Focus</i> and <i>Crosswords DS</i> appear to be immune from expiry, for now.
