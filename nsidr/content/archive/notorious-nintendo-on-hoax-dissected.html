<p>Shortly before this year's E3, an amazingly well-produced CG video began circulating the 'net that promoted a supposedly upcoming helmet-based gaming device from Nintendo called the "Nintendo On".  Though later revealed to be a hoax, the video captivated the minds of many Nintendo fans with its high quality production and radical concept.</p> 

<a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3141783">1up.com</a> recently managed to find the creator of the video, and sat down with them to discuss some behind-the-scenes action.  What was the motivation behind making the video?  How was it made?  These answers and more, along with a soul-crushing misspelling of N-Sider staffer Jeffrey Van Camp's name in what should have been his precious five minutes of fame, can be found at the above link.</p>
