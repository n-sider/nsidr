I just got off the Balance Board, playing some <i>Marble Saga Kororinpa</i> in lieu of the usual <i>Wii Fit</i> yoga I do each morning.  (I'm pretty sure it's not equivalent, but I enjoyed myself.)  As you may have read in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/rolling-marbles-with-hudsons-osamu-tsuchihashi-and-mike-pepe">our Q&A</a>, <i>Marble Saga</i> comes with 30 Balance-Board-specific levels.  They're markedly less twisty and turny than the levels you play with the Remote, and the time threshholds must be set <i>incredibly</i> high since I've yet to get anything but Platinum trophies on them, but they're enjoyable nonetheless.<br />
<br />

It might just be my imagination, but it seems that in these levels, the marble physics are a lot closer to the original <i>Kororinpa</i>.  If you're following Internet impressions of the game, you may have heard that <i>Marble Saga</i>'s physics seem different.  I think the best way to describe it is that there seems to be a "dead zone" in the middle of the range of tilt you can get out of the Wii Remote.  I <i>think</i> it's less pronounced in "Normal" mode (though I could be wrong); but in both modes, it does make it more difficult to perform tiny, precise movements.<br />
<br />
That said?  I didn't notice it when I <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/tilting-at-marbles-the-short-but-sweet-kororinpa-2-demo">played the demo</a>.  I can't go back and verify against the demo&mdash;I've already loaned it out to family; isn't that what demos are for?&mdash;but I think the reason I didn't catch it is that it I didn't really use the animal marbles; the resistance on those is <i>much</i> more pronounced, feeling like they are coated in sticky goo.  Playing with the standard marble (the best one I've got unlocked thus far) feels just fine and its physics reasonable.  I can understand how it might throw someone who's got extensive muscle memory trained up on the original <i>Kororinpa</i>, of course; but as for me&mdash;and maybe it's just been a long time since I played that game&mdash;it doesn't present a problem.
