<p>Players going online with <A href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a> with the downloads option turned on (as it is by default) are receiving a special item from Nintendo today, attached to the following message:</p>

<blockquote><p>I hope you are enjoying your Nintendo DS.  Please accept this New Year's gift with my gratitude.</p>

<p>From S. Iwata</p></blockquote>

<p>The item in question is a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=235"><i>Super Mario Bros.</i></a> coin, previously <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/396-Animal-Crossing-Wild-World-Hacks.html">found by homebrewers</a>.  Nook will buy the coin for 256 bells, and it doesn't appear in the game's catalog for reordering.  It's not quite downloadable content as such, but it's a nice plus for game owners nonetheless.</p>
