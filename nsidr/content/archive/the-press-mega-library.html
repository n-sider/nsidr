<b>Man Mods NES to House Second NES</b><br />
<br />
An enterprising local man has cashed in on the latest craze in D.I.Y. chic and found himself an excellent place to store his aging Nintendo Entertainment System videogame console.  Tom Salisbury, a 45-year-old data entry specialist from the lower east side, said the idea "just came to him" as he was watching an edited-for-television airing of Pink Floyd's The Wall motion picture.<br />
<br />
"Well, I always was wishing that I had some place to put that old Nintendo, there," Salisbury told Press reporters Sunday.  "I was strolling through the Goodwill earlier in the day looking for a couple pairs of new socks on account of Betty threw them in with the reds, and a man can't be wearing pink socks, and I remembered seeing an old Nintendo system for a few dollars.  I picked it up you know just cause and bought it really cause, well, you don't even know why you buy stuff sometimes.  That's how it got started, man."<br />
<br />
Salisbury was quick to point out that he was wearing white socks.<br />
<br />
"Anyway, I saw it on the news how people was putting different things into Nintendo systems, oh, one fellow put a DVD player in it, and there was some people putting even computers in them, and I was like... wow, I gotta get in on this stuff.  And when I was watching Floyd well... it came to me," Salisbury said with a grin.  <br />
<br />
The Press reporters were then led to a back room with a peculiar aroma where Salisbury demonstrated what "months of hard work" had brought him: his old Nintendo Entertainment System placed entirely within a second system's shell.  When asked to comment on what realistic, functional value the object had, Salibury remained silent for a moment, and then stated that it was "so [postmodern] that [he] couldn't even figure out why [he] should have to respond."  Salisbury then offered Press reporters a bag of Chex Mix, adding that he "really enjoy[s] the crunchy brown things."<br />
<br />
"I plan to have pictures and video up on my website in the next couple weeks so people can see how to do this too," he remarked.  "When you think about it, we've all got a little of ourselves inside of us."<br />

<b>Generic Guy Beaten to Within an Inch of Life, Then Grabbed and Flipped Over Head into Some Other Guys</b><br />
<br />
For one local guy, Thursday began as any other day would have.<br />
<br />
"I was just waiting around, a little out of sight," this sort of purple guy with brown hair said.  "I was talking to my friend with the white shirt, who is next to the guy with the chain, like any other morning.  Nothing too out of the ordinary."<br />
<br />
But then, tragedy struck.<br />
<br />
"These two dudes, a blue dude and a red dude, who I have never seen before in my life, come rolling up here all of a sudden and beating up everyone for no reason, just walking down the street absolutely destroying everything," the guy told us.  "Punching barrels in half, throwing rocks around, jumping through the air and kicking people in the face... I don't know what was special about me, but they went for me as soon as they saw me."<br />
<br />
The two assailants, who were pursuing their kidnapped girlfriend according to reports, began punching and kicking the guy.  "I was just about done for, obviously not any kind of threat.  Maybe I could have withstood I dunno, one more punch before I had had enough.  But then he held back, almost like he was toying with me, wouldn't finish the job."<br />
<br />
What happened next was especially vicious, according to the guy with the chain.  "He grabbed him by the hair and just flipped him over his shoulder, right into me and some other guys, knocking us all down," the guy with the chain said, still brandishing his chain and standing in place.  "What would possess a man to do that?  Dangle a guy's life in front of him?  Just sick."<br />
<br />
The Press awaits comment from the two assailants, who were last seen leaping from a local roof and grabbing onto the bars of a rapidly-departing helicopter, reportedly in search of some other, different guys.<br />

News in Brief:<br />
<br />
<b>Resident Evil Evicted</b><br />
<br />
After a stay of residency lasting nearly sixteen years, one local landlord has finally bid 'farewell' to a distinctly evil upstairs renter.  "Never did know what they? It?... was getting into up there," said Bill Sergeant of Sergeant Units last Sunday at a nearby coffee shop.  "It got to be too much after a while, though I couldn't tell you exactly why.  Itchy, tasty."<br />
<br />
Though the evil inhabitants always managed to pay their rent on time, it was a risk Sergeant was unwilling to take any longer, he told Press reporters.  "I really needed to clear the unit for someone a little more good."<br />
<br />
<b>Area Cats Feel Slighted by New Nintendo Game</b><br />
<br />
Though area dogs are riding high a wave of popularity reinvigorated by Nintendo's recent "Nintendogs + Cats" game for the 3DS system, area cats are reportedly not so enthused.<br />
<br />
"We aren't even considered good enough to be prefaced with 'Ninten'," one cat, who really loves people and goes just nuts when you pull the string around like this, said at a press conference this week.  "It's just a formality, but it would really mean a lot if we could get the same respect as those other hairy animals," he mentioned so cutely, while licking his paw and rubbing it against the side of his face.<br />
<br />
The cat started talking about something like merely wanting equality or whatever, which many people in the audience weren't really paying attention to because the way his little tail was flicking back and forth was just so adorable.<br />

<b>QUESTIONABLY CRAPPY</b><br />
<br />
<b>Nintendo President Reggie's Face Photoshopped onto Picture of Reggie's Face</b><br />
<br />
"It sounded like a freight train," 78-year-old Myrna Winters told Press reporters, anxiety in her voice, at her home in New Brunswick today.  "I've never felt anything like it.  It was like my ancestors were trying to call me from their graves, God rest their souls."<br />
<br />
Dozens of people in and around the New Brunswick area reported sensing something just "wasn't right" this morning, following an incident in the dormitory of a local college student, who spoke with The Press on condition of anonymity.<br />
<br />
"I mean, this is the final frontier, right?  We've put Reggie on everything&#8212;The Terminator, animals, Jesus&#8212;the only way to really stand out on the Internet is to do something totally radical, and putting Reggie's face onto a picture of Reggie was the way to do it."<br />
<br />
The student, who downloaded a copy of Photoshop illegally from the Internet last year, said this was only his latest foray into the world of image manipulation.  <br />
<br />
"Just last week I figured out how to use lens flares, which was pretty cool," he said, beckoning Press reporters to his Gateway-branded personal computer.  "Ever wanted to see what Reggie would look like with some pearly whites?"<br />
<br />
"It's just sick," said Tom Slop, 55, of the lower New Brunswick area.  "The way that kids today think they can just... what was it?  Vodashop, anything onto anything else, it's got to be stopped."  He continued, "One day you'll be walking down the street and it'll happen to you.  That poor Reggie.  That poor poor man."<br />

<b>Microsoft's Xbox Division Changes Official Pronunciation of 'LIVE' Online Service Name, Instantly Causing Over Six Billion to Die</b><br />
<br />
After a late-day change Tuesday to the official pronunciation of their Xbox LIVE service&#8212;which touts its always-on "live" persistence as a main selling point&#8212;the world finds itself without all of its inhabitants save for the thirty million current Xbox LIVE users.<br />
<br />
"We're... not completely sure what happened," said chief Xbox LIVE engineer Rick Sandham, when questioned about the effects of the official pronunciation change.  "Things break, though obviously we didn't entirely plan on converting nearly all of the human civilization into a thick, inanimate goo.  At this time we are not calling it a hardware issue."<br />
<br />
Xbox LIVE spokesperson Larry Hyrb, who is known by the moniker Major Nelson, continued.  "But hey, looking at the bright side of things, separating our potential userbase into the LIVE group and then all other people really increases the value-add for our subscribers, who as of this weekend enjoy some really exclusive benefits."<br />
<br />
Though a speech analyst hired by Microsoft had initially voiced some concerns, executives were unconvinced.<br />
<br />
"I told them," analyst Lori Dumas said.  "Most people don't consider the very real ramifications of just changing the way you want people to pronounce a product name.  Imagine if Kraft had changed the pronunciation of Minute Rice&#8212;rice-loving Americans could be facing a real hunger problem."<br />
<br />
Though Microsoft insisted it was a harmless mistake that led to the six million humans being "unceremoniously burgered," as Hyrb put it, Dumas was unsatisfied.<br />
<br />
She continued, without being prompted, "The examples are everywhere.  Did you ever see the movie 'Rebel Without a Cause?'  Thank god we pronounced that one the way we did, or we might have had a nation fraught with chaotic, violent teenagers... this move just shows ignorance on Microsoft's part."  She continued, asking "who will console the console owners now?"  At this time, Hyrb told Dumas to shut her "stupid face."<br />
<br />
Microsoft has not announced any changes to their pricing structure, though Hyrb did voice some concerns about how they might continue to grow their userbase now that over 99% of the Earth's population&#8212;who were magically destroyed at the time of the name change&#8212;are ineligible.<br />
<br />
"The real gains to be had are in monetizing our current userbase.  We have the new LIVE Anywhere system we're working on, which will be made easier now that a lot of the world's housing has freed up."  Accompanied by some stifled laughter, Hyrb expressed only a small amount of regret that he was unable to convince his wife and children to join Xbox LIVE before the switch.<br />
<br />
"They had never really been interested in my work," Hyrb told Press reporters.  "I guess it's a little late now," he added, customizing the t-shirt on his in-game avatar.<br />
