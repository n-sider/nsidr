Publisher Gamecock is bringing Red Fly Studio's <i>Mushroom Men - The Spore Wars</i>, a backyard battlefield action game, to both the DS and Wii.<br />
<br />
The story goes that a passing comet sprinkled green dust all over the Earth, but while scientists decided it didn't cause any problems, certain plants had suddenly gained full consciousness. Among these new intelligent plants, tribes arose. The different mushroom species split into three distinct tribes: primitive Boletes, aggressive Amanitas, and inventive Morels. With these newly formed nations came war.<br />
<br />
Players take control of a Bolete and use the unique control schemes of the Wii and DS to transform everyday household items into weapons. For example, in the Wii version players can use the remote as a bazooka, and in the DS version the stylus simulates a rapier.<br />
<br />
Red Fly intends to give each version of the game its own distinct storyline, as well as adapt the gameplay to best match their respective control schemes.<br />
<br />
Neither version of Mushroom Men has been given a specific date, but Gamecock and Red Fly Studios are currently aiming for a release in Fall 2008.
