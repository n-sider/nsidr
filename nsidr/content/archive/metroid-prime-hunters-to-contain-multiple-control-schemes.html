<p>Shigeru Miyamoto was interviewed in the latest issue of Nintendo Official Magazine, according to Cube-Europe.</p>

<p>Miyamoto commented on <i>Metroid Prime: Hunters</i> for the Nintendo DS. He said Nintendo would include a control scheme for the game that does not require the touch screen, due to several complaints from users about having to hold the DS and use the touch screen simultaneously. He also commented on the touch screen itself, saying if it gets dirty, a cotton swab can be used to clean the screen.</p>

<p>Miyamoto mentioned the next Mario title saying Nintendo is currently experimenting with the game and deciding upon which system to create it for.</p>
