<p>Australian publisher QVS will distribute Mercury Type R from Ignition Entertainment in the land down under, according to AdvancedMN.  The publisher has the Wii title listed on its <a href="http://www.qvsoftware.com.au/products/products.asp?cat=Wii&scat=0&pid=243&rc=0&keywords=">website</a> with an $89.95 price tag and availability date of December 2, 2007.  QVS will also publish the Atlus-developed Metal Slug Anthology in Australia and has it listed for a November 17, 2006 release.  Dates and prices for these games are likely not final.</p>

<p>Some may recall that back in <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3151598">June</a>, European distribution lists had two Mercury titles scheduled for Wii.   Ignition Entertainment was contacted then but declined to confirm either game's existence.  At that time, Ignition president Paul Robinson responded to the information saying, "Because of the versatility of Mercury Meltdown it certainly lends itself to a number of next-gen console opportunities. We can't comment further at this time but we plan to have additional announcements regarding Mercury Meltdown in the near future."</p>

<p>We'll let you know of further confirmation.</p>
