<br />
Nintendo is offering video previews of Virtual Console games on the game pages of the <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/virtualconsole.jsp">Virtual Console catalog</a> at wii.nintendo.com.  The videos show off the gameplay of the various titles, offering Virtual Console buyers at least a little taste of what they're plunking down Wii Points for before they actually push the button and flood their room with the sound of Mario getting coins.<br />
<br />
In a rather ironic twist, though, reports are that Wii's own Internet Channel can't actually view the videos, despite the fact that they are apparently published as Flash video files.  Hopefully, this oversight will be corrected&mdash;or at the very least, compatible videos will be added to the Wii Shop Channel itself.
