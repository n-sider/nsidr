<p><b>Wii Sports</b><br>
Format: Wii<br>
Launch Date: TBA<br>
ESRB: RP (Rating Pending)<br>
Game Type: Sports<br>
Players: 1-4, depending on the game<br>
Developer: Nintendo</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Tennis (1-4 players): Players grab the controller like a racket and swing - the
game will register forehands, backhands, volleys, lobs, slices, spin and power
depending on how fast the user swings and at what angle. Don't worry about
moving around the court to get to the ball - the game automatically moves players
into position.
<li>Baseball (1-2 players): Grip the controller like a bat and swat fastballs out of the
park in a home run derby. Timing and bat speed will make all the difference
between going yard and whiffing, so keep an eye on the ball and swing for the
fences. In the two-player game, one player pitches and the other bats.
<li>Golf (1 player): Step up to the tee, hold the controller like a golf club and swing
naturally to smack the ball onto the green. The harder players swing the club, the
farther the ball will fly, so be sure to take some practice swings before going for
the pin. After reaching the green, line up putts carefully, practice the stroke and
try to hole out.
<li>Additional games may be added to the Wii Sports group.
