<br />
Officially released yesterday, both versions of the game feature over 100 new battlin' critters, as well as a wealth of online features using Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection.  Voice chat using the newly-released Nintendo DS Headset is a possibility for friends, and Nintendo is also running a global trading station for Pokémon exchange as well as a "Battle Tower" where players can download data from other players to compete against and rise in rank.<br />
<br />
Both versions of the game have sold millions in Japan, and Nintendo expects the titles to "be among the top-selling games of the year in the United States."
