<p>Peter Moore, vice president of Microsoft's Games Division, told <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051100612.html">Reuters</a> Thursday that he predicts consumers will choose two consoles: Nintendo's Wii and Microsoft's Xbox 360.  "Tell me why you would buy a $600 PS3?" he asked. "People are going to buy two (machines.) They're going to buy an Xbox and they're going to buy a Wii...for the price of one PS3."</p>

<p>Sony will begin selling its PlayStation 3, depending on the hard drive size, for $499 and $599 when it debuts in North America on November 17. Moore told Reuters, "People will always gravitate toward a competitively priced product -- like what I believe Wii will be -- with innovative new designs and great intellectual property like Mario, Zelda and Metroid."</p>
