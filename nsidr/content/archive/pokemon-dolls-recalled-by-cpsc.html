The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said it has announced the recall of 9,200 Pokmon plush toys because their stuffing may contain "tips of sewing needles that can pose puncture hazards."  The dolls were sold at Nintendo World in New York City and also given away as a promotion at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May. No injuries have been reported.  If you are in possession of one of the "PokDoll" character toys, you can contact Pokmon USA to receive a free replacement via its <a href="site.http://www.pokemoncenter.com/store/recall.asp">website</a>.
