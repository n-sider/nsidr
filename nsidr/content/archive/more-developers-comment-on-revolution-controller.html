Gamasutra.com posed the question to several professionals in the industry, "What genres and types of games do you think will be most suited to the recently revealed Revolution controller? Are there any specific ideas or concepts that you're itching to see brought to fruition on Nintendo's next-gen console?"  The column received a wide array of responses.<br><br>

Johnnemann Nordhagen from Sony Computer Entertainment America, responded to the question saying, "The obvious answer is first-person shooters, but I think that the question almost misses the point. Trying to shoehorn existing genres into the controller concept is not the exciting part of the new system, although I don't doubt we'll see some excellent interpretations of things like RTS games. To me, the promise of the new controller is that it allows new types of games. The question that should be asked is not "How can we do what we've been doing on this controller?" but rather "What does this controller allow that was not possible or not elegant previously?" Much like the DS games that would not have been enjoyable on any other system, I'm looking forward to the games that can only exist on Revolution."<br><br>
