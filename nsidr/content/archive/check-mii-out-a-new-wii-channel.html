During the Nintendo E3 press conference, a new Wii channel was revealed.<br />
<br />
This free Wii channel builds on the phenomenon of people creating fun Mii caricatures. Now people can show off Miis they have created either on their own or for Nintendo-suggested competitions.<br />
<br />
The channel will be available sometime this year as a free downloadable in the WiiWare shop.
