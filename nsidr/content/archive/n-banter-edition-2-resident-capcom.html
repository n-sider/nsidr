<h3>N-Banter Edition 2: Resident Capcom?</h3>
<b><font size="2">Edition: 12.18.02</font></b><br>
Two minds...<i>one</i> site. Two motives...<i>one</i> goal. Two editors...<i>one</i> conversation. You have now entered a dimension unlike any other. This is <b>N-Banter</b>.


<p><hr>
<b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Did you see the US box art for <I>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</I>?

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Nope. How is it?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b><a target=newwindow href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/380/380145p1.html">Gold</a>

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Very simple...but I suppose elegant at the same time.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I dont know if I care for it. The new logo just doesnt mesh with the color like the classic sword and shield did. Anyway, what do you think about the rumors of Nintendo buying out Capcom? <a target=newwindow href="http://spong.com/index.asp?art=4105">Heres a link.</a>

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, I saw thatScary.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Capcoms relationship with Nintendo has gained much strength in recent years: developing <i>The Legend of Zelda Oracle</i> series for the Game Boy Color, gearing most of its resources toward the GameCube, etc.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I know. But, it's scary nonetheless.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Indeed. However, the question remains, would you be happy about it? 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, in a way, definitely, from the point of view of a Nintendo fan...but at the same time, no.  Its difficult to predict the direction the video game industry is heading. ^_^

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah, the whole Rare situation kind of threw me for a loop a few months back. I didnt think the two companies were ready to part ways. So, Im hesitant to take a firm stance on this issue.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>...with the Square Enix announcement, Microsoft consuming third parties left and right, and rumors of Nintendo doing the same, Id say it's pretty frightening.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Definitely, it kind of leaves one in a <I>Super Powers</I> state of mind.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>This is what I see happening.  I think that the industry is going to get to a point when new companies with new ideas simply won't have a chance to start from scratch and be creative. They'll have to rely on the big guys from the mega-corporations. This, in a way, is already happening.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Much like what happened to the movie industry; its sad.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>In the end, I feel it could hinder the growth of the industry - the growth of innovation - rather than progress it. Hopefully, at the end of the day, Nintendo will stick to its values. Who knows its outcome though...I don't even understand the company anymore. Not that I really did in the first place, but I at least had a general understanding of them. Now, they're just crazy.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>They have always been crazy.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>True, true.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>It was crazy to make a console in the first place, but they made it work with the NES (Famicon).  

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah...but the circumstances in which they made it...they did all the right things.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>It was crazy to stick with the cartridge format with the Nintendo 64. It was crazy to let another company make Zelda games (for the Cdi). It was crazy how they burned Sony on the SNES add-on

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Hehe. That sure came back to bite them in the butt.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>It was crazy that they attempted to support an entire console with only a <I>Dream Team</I> of developers.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>So are you saying acquiring Capcom could potentially be a crazy blunder?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Hey now, I wasn't done with the crazy list. There are some positives.  It was crazy that a <I>Sonic the Hedgehog</I> game appeared on a Nintendo system and <I>Resident Evil</I> became exclusive.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>That it was.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>It was crazy to see the Game Boy Advance shaped like its predecessors greatest threat (GameGear). It was crazy to hear that Nintendo was entrusting a license like <I>Metroid</I> to an unproven Texan developer.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Okay, okay, you've proven your point that Nintendo has always been crazy. ;-) So, if you could look into the future, could acquiring Capcom be a good crazy or a bad crazy?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Hmm. Capcom owns many of the most enduring and well-known characters and franchises in gaming. And the company has proven that they are fully capable of making top quality titles if they put their heart into it. I believe that Capcom has been trying to up the quality of its products for a few years now. Attempting to bring quality and innovation (at least lately) to the forefront.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah. Don't just look at the benefits for Nintendo and/or Capcom though. I mean, as childish as it sounds, could this cause Microsoft to retaliate by gobbling up Konami or Sega or...?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>From my standpoint, Konami is pretty much ungobblable currently. They are doing too well.  

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Okay, take Konami out of the question then.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>It would be a poor business decision for Microsoft to acquire Sega. Unless, of course, you can name an Xbox exclusive (from Sega) that sold welland I dont think you can. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I mean, once it starts, who's to say it will ever stop until there are just three <I>mega companies</I> left?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I doubt it. Sony hasn't acquired anyone lately. On the other hand, Nintendo has let go of Left Field and Rare so they have some gaps left to fill from my standpoint.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, that is true. Also, Sony has the <I>Grand Theft Auto</I> license exclusive. Perhaps they'll make the decision to make it permanent?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Not really, it is still on PC. They just cut a console deal. Sony is into just getting a few major licenses like <I>Tomb Raider</I> or <I>Final Fantasy</I> exclusive and living off their own hype.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, that was in the past though. Who's to say that if Nintendo acquires Capcom, that it won't start a trend in the industry? It may or may not, but think about what would happen if it did. That's all I'm trying to say.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>If Nintendo does purchase Capcom it would be a very strong statement that they are here to be competitive and are going nowhere.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I agree. I think primarily it would be beneficial to Nintendo's market perception, as Capcom develops the majority of its titles for older demographics.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Whos to say that Nintendo's purchase of Rare and many other developers in the mid-90s wasn't going to set a trend?

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>In a way it did...Sony acquired many studios during its early years, Naughty Dogg, 989 Studios, and others. However, a lot of them fell apart...likewise the same situation occurred with Nintendo and Left Field, etc. Yet, Rare and Left Field were small developers at the time, as were the others. With Capcom, were talking about a company composed of thousands of people around the world. The situation is at an entirely different level.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>True.  But Microsoft's entire strategy has always revolved around purchasing their way into gamers homes...even at the price of 2 billion dollars in losses on the Xbox, that says something.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah...and that's what scares me.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I mean, what did "Opening the Xbox", the book about Microsoft Xbox's history say...at one time Microsoft approached Nintendo to make games for its console?  That would have been horrible had it gone through.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yes, but Nintendo is too set in its ways to ever do that. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I suppose.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Microsoft has purchased many developers already, most notably would be Bungie.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah...here's a bigger list. ;) Bungie Software, Digital Anvil, Ensemble Studios, Gas Powered Games, Relic Entertainment, FASA Interactive, NetGames USA, Access Software, Big Huge Games...and of course, Rare.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Getting back to the point. Nintendo is one of the most conservative companies around. They design their games to uphold their tradition of being the best and selling the best on their own systems. Purchasing Capcom isn't going to cause other companies to run to the nearest Japanese developer and <I>buy, buy, buy</I>. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I dunno, heh. Microsoft could use a boost in Japan. ;-)

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Anyway, this is simply a rumor. I probably shouldn't be calling it the "end of the world" just yet. *stubs toe* It's the end of the world!

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b> Hah.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>You know, I don't understand why websites post rumors when they have no evidence themselves (referring to the Nintendo buys Capcom rumor). All they're doing is spreading and nourishing what could be potentially untrue.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Indeed, I wouldn't think of posting a news story such as this rumor about Capcom and Nintendo. Until it is a little more official or the rumors start to come with a little more evidence.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, it's just sensationalism. All entertainment, no news value at all.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>So what do you think of Miyamotos Pikmin 2 announcement...err, what did you think of the original?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I thought it was a pretty cool game; it was very original and unique. Not necessarily my favorite on the GCN but rather a game played for a change of pace. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah. It could have used more length in my opinion. I didn't care for the feeling of being rushed either (with the individual level time limit). It would be interesting if Nintendo could somehow make Pikmin 2 online...having players battle each other with their armies of Pikmin would be something neat, no?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yes, I am very interested to see what Nintendo will do to make Pikmin 2 unique.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Perhaps, it'll become <I>MegaMan Pikmin Adventures</I>, heh.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Haha, I don't know if they will have the guts to put it online though.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Just like Pikmin online is probably a fanboy's dreamso is the prospect of Nintendo buying Capcom.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Pikmin Online is a fanboy's dream, but I don't know that Nintendo is out to fulfill fanboy dreams. They run their own agenda. We are still waiting for a <I>Mother 3</I> (Earthbound), but I just don't know if we will end up getting one
