<p>We've received word from Nintendo that a webcast of its E3 press conference will be available on May 9.  We've also heard that those lucky few attending the show live will be assigned to different Nintendo-themed seating areas including Warioland, Mushroom Kingdom, Yoshi's Island,  Hyrule, etc.  We'll let you know of further details as the time approaches.</p>

<p>Only ten days remain until the big morning where Nintendo will finally take the veil off its revolutionary console and games.  N-Sider will be in attendance to cover the press conference and the following days of the E3 expo.  For a history of the event, check out N-Sider's feature <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/the-history-of-e-3-2006-update">The History of E3</a>.</p>

<p>Third-party developers are already preparing for the overload of information that will arrive at the show with early software announcements.  N-Sider has compiled a list of games officially announced for Nintendo's Wii console.  Keep in mind, especially if you notice any games lacking, that this list reflects only those that have a publisher or are being created by an established developer.</p>
