<p>We've had some interest expressed in our forums regarding how one would go about breaking into the video game industry.  Our number one suggestion would of course be to complete your education.  But if you live in the Seattle, WA, area and need some further assistance, here's something that was passed on to us.  The Game Initiative will be holding the "Seattle Video Game Industry Job Conference and Resume Workshop" on February 12, 2005 at the Shoreline Center.  More information on the event can be found <a href="http://www.thegameinitiative.com/seattle/">here</a>.</p>
