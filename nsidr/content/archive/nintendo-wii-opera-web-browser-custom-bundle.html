<p><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/709/709705p1.html">IGN.com</a> has tagged Scott Hedrick, executive vice president of Opera for Devices, to get the skinny on the company's involvement in providing a Web browser for the Nintendo Wii.</p>

<p>Opera is developing a customized version of its browser that will make use of the Wii's features including its motion-sensing remote control. Hedrick said, "I think that Nintendo quickly found that Opera was really the only browser that could meet and exceed their expectations in terms of speed, functionality and innovation. We are also very like-minded companies, placing the user experience first and ensuring that our products are not exclusive but rather inclusive, no matter age or gender."</p>

<p>Although he doesn't confirm it, Hedrick's comments indicate the Opera Web browser will be included as standard software in every Wii console. "I can confirm that it will not be sold as a separate item, as it is for Nintendo DS," he said.</p>

<p>Hedrick believes Nintendo's Wii Connect 24, which gives the console a permanent connection to the Internet, is a natural environment for the inclusion of the Opera browser. "As Nintendo touts Wii as "always connected" it is natural that a browser should be a part of their strategy, as a gateway to the Web," he concluded.  "I believe that Web technology will increasingly be a part of the gaming experience, whether it's live content being pushed onto games or you're just checking your Web mail while playing Mario Kart."</p>
