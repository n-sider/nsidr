Nintendo Europe has pulled the latest iteration in the Mario Party series from store shelves due to an <a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/news/article.do?elementId=_jR0wKfS2CwpY0y7n8lt4K8-wPFfex7l">assembly error</a> which wrote the wrong version of the game to some disks. They refrained from commenting on exactly what the problem is, but reports say that the game contains the word "spastic," a derogatory term for people with mental disabilities. <br />

<i>Mario Party 8</i>, for Wii, is the second game in less than a month to be pulled from shelves for that reason&mdash;the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2902">first game</a> being Ubisoft's <i>Mind Quiz</i>, for DS and PSP. Nintendo Europe has yet to announce a date for a relaunch.
