Cartoon Network New Media is introducing an "interactive video and gaming experience to broadband-enabled consoles" in late 2007 to early 2008 called MEGA Series.<br />
<br />
The service, developed by AFI's Digital Content Lab, is an application made for adaptation to a wide variety of devices, and will begin its launch on the Wii along with the PC and PS3. For Wii, MEGA Series will be launched through the console's internet browser and utilizes Adobe Flash. MEGA Series programming will be based on Cartoon Network and Adult Swim shows, while all content is created to display simultaneously, with streaming video, and delivered episodically over time.<br />
<br />
Cartoon Network is the first television network to use Flash to reach a wide console audience with a video-on-demand and gaming service.
