<p>Over the past two months, third-party support for Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> has nearly tripled.  In fact, there are almost 30 studios confirmed to be working on content.  We've performed an exhaustive update to N-Sider's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/a-third-party-revolution">A Third-Party Revolution</a> piece which lists every developer and publisher currently readying titles for Nintendo's new device. Recall that Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo's executive vice president of sales and marketing, told <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/20/the-engadget-interview-reggie-fils-aime-executive-vice-preside/">Engadget.com</a> at the end of February that Nintendo had already shipped over a thousand controller development kits to developers.  As such, expect developers, as they begin to realize their ideas, to add to the support that is guaranteed to grow even more over the coming months.</p>
