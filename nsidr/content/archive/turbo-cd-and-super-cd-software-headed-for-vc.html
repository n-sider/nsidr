Hudson has announced today its intent to bring Turbo CD and Super CD games to Wii's Virtual Console service.  Specifically:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">Wii owners with a high-speed Internet connection can redeem Wii Points to download these classic games through the Wii Shop Channel. Soon, Wii owners will be able to enjoy even more software titles previously released on other platforms. These titles will be available for download beginning in October of this year in Japan, and thereafter will extend to North America, Europe and Australia. Now Wii gamers will be able to play games originally created specifically for CD-ROM media, in addition to TurboGrafx-16 game titles already available via Virtual Console.<br />
<br />
Players will simply select their favorite games in the Wii Shop Channel to download the software via the Internet. Each Turbo CD and Super CD download will be priced at 800 Wii Points, which can be purchased either by credit card or through a Wii Points Card which are available at various retail locations.</div><br />
Hudson plans to bring more than five titles from these systems in 2007 and more than ten in 2008.
