The game details for <i>Mario Kart Wii</i> are finally officially out from Nintendo, and there's an unsettling confirmation for those who don't think they can abide racing with the Wii Wheel or the Remote.<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">Control: Mario Kart Wii is compatible with four different control schemes, so players can customize how they want to play:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Wii Remote Controller (with or without Wii Wheel): Steer by tilting the Wii Remote left and right. Or snap the Wii Remote into the Wii Wheel to transform it into a steering wheel for an intuitive, motion-based control scheme.</li>
  <li>Nunchuk Controller: Steer with the Control Stick on the Nunchuk and use the Wii Remote to accelerate, perform tricks and drift.</li>
  <li>Classic Controller: Mario Kart veterans can let their thumbs do the driving with the Classic Controller. However, players cannot perform certain moves with this control scheme.</li>
  <li>Nintendo GameCube Controller: Experienced Mario Kart fans may also enjoy this familiar scheme, although some maneuvers cannot be performed.</li>
  </ul></div><br />
What these "certain moves" are isn't entirely clear&#8212;IGN already confirmed that tricks can be pulled off by mashing the d-pad.
