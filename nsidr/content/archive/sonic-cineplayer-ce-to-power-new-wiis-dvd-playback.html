Sonic Solutions, makers of CinePlayer DVD playback software, has announced that Nintendo will be using its CinePlayer CE DVD Navigator software in a future version of Nintendo's Wii console&mdash;one that comes equipped with DVD playback technology. <br />
<br />
The planned release of this new Wii model was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2500">confirmed by Nintendo</a> last month.  Nintendo is most likely required to release a new Wii model in order to make this move, as they probably opted to omit the content-protection hardware that the DVD Copy Control Association requires for DVD playback to keep costs low.  This hardware allows DVDs with the appropriate flag set to turn on Macrovision's technology that prevents VCRs from recording the video from a DVD player.<br />
<br />
Sonic said Nintendo plans to release the DVD-capable Wii in the latter half of 2007, though they did not say what regions this hardware would be in.  Nintendo has previously said such a device would only be released in Japan.
