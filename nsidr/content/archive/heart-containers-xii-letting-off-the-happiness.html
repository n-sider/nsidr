<h3>[05.06] XII - Letting Off the Happiness</h3><P>I sit here typing this at 12:21 which is really at night and not at noon like you might think.  I am done with school now and super grateful that it is over.  I can move on from writing fourteen page stories on three hours of sleep and hammering out several page rhetorical essays about nothing and instead go back home and write Heart Containers columns on time and work a poopy job to make money so I can buy one of those sexy new PowerBook G4s.  I think I will post a picture of one of those sexy PowerBook G4s now.</P>

<P>God, I'm such a bad boyfriend.</P>
<P>Oh yeah this week we're talking about quirky stuff in videogames.  I mean, if you want.</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Hi Brandy or Scotch, or whatever you like to be called,</P>
 
    <P>How are you i'm doing just fine, i hope you read this because i'm taking a lot of time to write it, although not enough time to capitalize letter and such, that's why i don't have any periods because if i put a period i'd have to capitalize a letter and that would be a pain, not like the final fantasy x-2 pain, but the bad one that hurts when you fall on your bum, i think that pain is kinda hot although rikku is hotter, and rydia owns them all let me tell you, pixels turn me on.</P>
 
    <P>But that's OK, because the only thing that turns me on more that Rydia from Final Fantasy II/IV is Earthbound. I enjoy nothing more than smacking New Age Retro Hippies around with a baseball bat. And really, that's why I love videogames, they let you do all the things you wish you could do it real life, but can't because it's illegal and not nice. One time I was SMAAAAAAASHing this New Age Retro Hippie and he dropped a hamburger and I was all, "What, no soyburger?" </P>
 
   <P> In fact, that reminds me, I was in Evansville, Indiana for Spring Break (it's like Florida, but there's no beach, and there are more farms, and the closest city, Princeton, is pretty old. Oh and at 10:00 Fox shows old reruns of Andy Griffith! There's an Andy Griffith group that meets every once in awhile and talks about the show) and I was flipping through the six channels of free TV we get there and I saw it: SpamJam. Do you know what SpamJam is? Probably not, so let me explain. SpamJam is what God does when he's feeling pissed off. This is the 21st century, he's beyond locusts and disease, God is hip with the times and is resorting to biological warfare. SpamJam, as the name implies, is basically a restaurant that serves meals made entirely out of Spam. That's right, they take perfectly good normal meals and replace the beef, pork, fish, and whatnot with Spam, it's horrible. Of course, I've never been there, so I could be wrong (yeah right, I saw on TV, the place was surrounded with New Age Retro Hippies just waiting to be SMAAAAAAASHed) so don't take my word on it, try and find a SpamJam near you. Oh, and if you don't like Spam, they also serve beef and pork hot-dogs. No joke.</P>
 
    <P>Although, seeing as how I don't like Spam, I turned the TV off and decided to play some Fire Emblem goodness. No really, I was actually going to play Fire Emblem, I swear! It's just that when I turned my Gameboy Advance on the title-screen for Golden Sun: The Lost Age was there, and I couldn't resist. I had a fun time, but I really wanted to play Fire Emblem, so I saved and turned it off. Needless to say, when I turned my Gameboy Advance on again there was the title screen for Final Fantasy Tactics Advance! I could have sworn that I put Fire Emblem into by GBA, but there was FFTA proving me wrong. Rather than ruin the moment, I spent a few hours beating my 120-something-ith mission. But I really wanted to play Fire Emblem, it's such a fun game! I really wanted to have more Fire Emblem, even though at the same time I was subconsciously dreading the game because I knew that there was no room for error. Still, I did it, I saved and turned off Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and I picked up Fire Emblem and I put it in my GBA, and tuned the power on, and lo and behold, I looked down and discovered that I was holding the TV remote control! I don't know how it happened, but rather than waste a good opportunity I turned on the TV just in time for a Just Shoot Me rerun. Don't get me wrong, the whole time I wanted to play Fire Emblem, but how often to you get to hear great lines like, "She fell on her fanny, and I saw a little panty!" Classic.</P>
 
  <P>  And that's where I am today. Right here on my fanny,  mere hours after playing Final Fantasy V (translated ROM, I hope Square doesn't mind seeing as how it's their own fault for not bringing over the SNES version in the first place!). Yes, I have made it my goal to beat all of the old NES and SNES RPGs that I missed. You know what that means? That means that from here until 2006 I will have no life outside of my computer. Here's a list of games I have to either start playing, or finish playing. (Because I know that everybody cares about my life this much)</P>
<P>-Final Fantasy I<BR>
-Final Fantasy II translation<BR>
-Final Fantasy III translation<BR>
-Final Fantasy V translation<BR>
-Earthbound<BR>
-Secret of Mana<BR>
-Terranigma<BR>
-Chrono Trigger (again and again)<BR>
-Tales of Phantasia</P>
<P>and I'll probably look into the older Dragon Warrior/Quest games if I feel like it</P>
<P>I've played most of the other big RPG's, but I'm always glad *forced smile* to add more to my list. Don't worry though, I'm at the end of FFI and V. And of course, I'll always have room for some Magical Drop II goodness. That's another one of my quirky videogame moments:</P>
 
<P>QUIRKY VIDEOGAME MOMENT:</P>
 
<P>I like watching The World's boobs shake as she jumps up and down after winning a match in Magical Drop 2!!</P>
 
<P>She could eat my soyburger any time she wants... if that makes any sense all. Heck, who am I kidding, this is the internet, you know what I mean. I might as well mention that Rebecca Chambers is pretty hot too, as is Cammy, and both girls from Chrono Trigger. </P>
 
<P>So is Ayumi Hamasaki. Hot, I mean. I'm listening to July 1st right now, it's a nice song. Oh yeah, and she's cute. Sure, she had surgery, but as long as her nose doesn't fall off I'm ok. She should get a videogame, like Michael Jackson had. Only it would be more like a slideshow and less like a videogame. And she could wear a ribbon instead of clothes and jump up and down in a provocative manner! I would so buy that! </P>
 
   <P> Although I'd also buy a Final Fantasy I-IX compilation, but Square-Enix doesn't listen to me either. That cool though, because I'll own them one day. If you remember one thing, remember my name, because it will help you remember the new World National Anthem you'll have to be reciting every morning in a few years. Good luck with the website, and try to update more often. </P>
 
<P>No, really, I did get around to playing Fire Emblem,</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>My favourite moment(s) in video game history come from Goldeneye.  You can't help but smile when Natalya dies and makes those stupid grunting noises.  </P>
<P>And its especially funny to throw proximity mines out of the door at the end of bunker 2 and watch her die as she runs out behind James and attempts to run through the flames like him (c'mon, you've all done this).</P>
<P>The best of all is in the very last level, when you have the fast motion cheat on, and just before you kill Baron Samedi for the third time, you switch the control setup to use two controllers, with the fire button on the second controller.  Then in the ending clip he runs up and starts laughing super fast, then you can hit fire and he dies.  Classic.</P>

What I didn't know, because I was in grade 3 and Nintendo games were Nintendo games, was that all of the rentals were Konami games :P   So, I had played one already, and knew a REALLY secret code for it...  This is probably the most SECRET code EVER DESIGNED!!!</P>
 
<P>UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, START</P>
 
<P>And whaddya know, the code worked with every game I rented that day!   We attributed it to the Nintendo consoles themselves, and got frustrated and tried for an hour and a half when it wouldn't work for Super Mario World and Kirby's Adventure...  then we ate cake and forgot all about it...</P>    </TD>

See, I didn't really get into Konami games until Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 for NES, and the code for that was B A B A UP DOWN B A LEFT RIGHT B A START.  That would give you the ten guys plus a stage select.  BUT HERE IS THE KICKER.  I always liked playing with two players.  So you know what I did?  I thought maybe I could put in a select.  So I did B A B A UP DOWN B A LEFT RIGHT B A <B>SELECT</b> START.  And you know what?  It worked and I thought I was a genius.  I must have beat that game forty times with that lovely code.</P>

<P>Oh and curses for people getting SNESes for birthdays.  I never got that much money for my birthday!  I did get a Gameboy one year though.  That was hot.  Except the only game they gave my ten-year old self was Yoshi's freaking Cookie.  Gah.</P>

<P>My favorite "quirky" videogame moment would have to be in Super Mario 64.
Go to WetDry World, jump in the cannon on the little island thing in the far
left corner, aim for the sun and fire.  It may take some practice (and
slight cannon adjustment), but if done right, Mario will fly up, hit an
invisible ceiling, fall back down, hit the ground hard enough to make him
loose health and then slide back into the cannon. If you do it multiple
times you will eventually kill Mario but he will still fall into the cannon.
You can shoot Dead Mario over and over. If you shoot him into the water, he
will instantly drown and if you shoot him onto land he will instantly pass
out. Pretty funny stuff...Zombie Mario.</P>


<P>Either that or my quirkiest gaming moment had to be watching my friend
incinerate a Gingerbread Man in Timesplitters 2 with a flamethrower-wielding
duck. That was freakin' hilarious (you'd have to be there). It brings a
smile to my face even now....</P>

<P>A pretty craaaazy column last time.  And the time before that.  And the time before THAT.  OK, so most of them were crazy.</P>

 

<P>Anyway, quirkiest game moment.  Hmm.  It would have to be when playing Super Smash Bros. Melee with a few of my buds.  Some choice pause-screen images there... I wish I'd saved them.  It was the day of my 18th birthday, you see, and after my birthday meal my friends and I returned to my abode for some SSBM insanity.  A variety of screenshots included Pikachu impersonating Neo (doing that weird lean-back-and-dodge-bullets (or in this case, Super Scope shots) thing), Link slicing off Ganondorf's *cough* manhood *cough*, Ganondorf getting revenge for that by crushing Link's... you know, and so on.  The bonus about this quirky moment was that it had a dual purpose - it was quirky and entertaining!</P>

 

<P>Anyway, keep up the good work.</P>
