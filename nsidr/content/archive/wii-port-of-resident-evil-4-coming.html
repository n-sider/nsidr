A Wii port of GameCube hit <i>Resident Evil 4</i> is <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/news/7198/1/Resident_Evil_Wii_Scans;_Resident_Evil_4_Wii_Confirmed">on its way</a> in Japan, as confirmed in a recent Famitsu.  The port will feature aiming with the Wii Remote and give Wii owners access to the additional content that was created for the PlayStation 2 release.<br />
<br />
Additional details were also made available concerning upcoming Wii exclusive <i>Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles</i>; the title will take the form of an on-rails shooter.  The title will tell the tale of the Umbrella Corporation, and a trailer for it will be included with copies of the Wii version of Resident Evil 4.<br />

Resident Evil 4 for Wii was originally rumored for North American release when a page appeared on gaming retailer GameStop's site, priced at $29.99 and with a release date of June 25.  When we have an official announcement as to release plans, we'll let you know.
