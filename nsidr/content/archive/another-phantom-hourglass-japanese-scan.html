<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3190-1.jpg" width="200" height="113" class="image_styled" /></div>The Japanese magazine scans for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i> just keep coming, as the game's release date approaches.<br />
<br />
The <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2007-05-10-phantom_hourglass_scan.jpg">latest scan</a> shows a few previously-unseen game elements, such as pirate leader Tetra, what is presumably the titular hourglass apparently being used to give Link a timed challenge, and treasure hunting.<br />
<br />
Phantom Hourglass hits Japan on June 23, and on some unspecified "holiday" date will come stateside.
