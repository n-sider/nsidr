So, starting today, you might notice us writing about games that aren't on Nintendo platforms.<br />
<br />
Eeyup.<br />
<br />
The times, they are a-changin'.  Or maybe we're just the ones who've changed.  Where it was once easy to place naught but a single Nintendo-box beside our behemoth tube televisions, these days find us with grander appetites.  As much as we adore and cling to Nintendo and her idiosyncrasies, it is undeniable that we need some fast lovin' on the side.<br />
<br />
Why, we ask ourselves, do we find ourselves at odds with our very own website these days?  The answer is simple: we're playing games we can't write about.  Sure, it's a Nintendo site, we're all basically Nintendo gamers, but this is a barren season.  Nintendo's big guns are all reloading, but this is some Civil War musket shit right here.  They won't be shooting for a <i>while</i>.  Billing <i>Animal Crossing</i> as the fall's most notable gamer's-game?  Trying times indeed.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />

I'd like to think that you, the reader, can identify with our plight.  Maybe you've been filling your time with some of the recent PSN and XBLA releases, or blasting some chumps in TF2, or playing Peggle on your iPhone.  Or maybe you don't know what any of those things even are!  If so, don't fret: N-Sider isn't going anywhere.<br />
<br />
Nintendo gaming is our focus, and it always will be.  We're gonna be trying something new, though, and move forward as the first dedicated Nintendo site that understands that Nintendo gamers can also be everything-else gamers.  In between our usual Nintendo pieces, we'll be talking about anything else we happen to find interesting in this vast and growing industry of ours.  We'd like to think that you'll find these things interesting, too!<br />
<br />
The hallmark of a well-adjusted Nintendo fan is the ability to appreciate gaming experiences regardless of the name on the box.  We're not going <i>multiplatform</i>, per say.  We're just writing to a Nintendo-groomed audience who might like to hear about what else the gaming world has to offer.<br />
<br />
Welcome to N-Sider: a site for Nintendo fans who maybe like other things, too.
