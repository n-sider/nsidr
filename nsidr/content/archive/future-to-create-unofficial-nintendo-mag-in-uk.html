<p>Buried in a story about recent editorial shakeups at Edge Magazine is the news that new senior editor Tony Mott will <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8985">help create a new magazine</a> devoted exclusively to Nintendo &mdash; though this one will be unofficial.</p>

<p>Future is <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1563">already responsible for Official Nintendo Magazine</a> in that territory, having launched it this past February.  The official magazine has already gained a bit of notoriety for claiming the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a>'s stand would double as a power stand &mdash; a report they later retracted.  ONM has very recently been the focus of attention as they had a feature that strongly hinted at a fall release for Revolution in Europe.</p>
