The <a href="http://www.dfcint.com/game_article/dec05article.html">DFC Intelligence</a> has published their latest report examining the state of software publisher stocks and market value.  Nintendo's market value has increased by 8 percent since the beginning of the year.  This is compared to Electronic Art's decline of nearly 17 percent.<br><br>
The article went on to further discuss what's to come in 2006 as well as what's currently happening on stores shelves.  Their investigation found the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> is more widely available and that many retailers are focusing much of their Sony PSP space on UMD videos.<br>

<blockquote><font size="2">"The biggest disappointment we have found so far is what we would consider to be very weak merchandising for the Sony PSP.  Many stores have displays for the Nintendo portable systems, but not the PSP.  What is worse is the tendency for stores to have a larger selection of UMD movies than PSP games.  Furthermore, the movies are often mixed right in with the games.  The portable battle is likely to get very interesting over the next two years."</font></blockquote>
