Bandai Namco Holdings has announced today that <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/784/784029p1.html">it has sold 80%</a> of its 96% stake in Monolith Soft to Nintendo, effective May 1.  Bandai Namco gave Monolith's growth potential as well as stronger ties with Nintendo as reasoning.<br />
<br />
Monolith is currently at work on Wii exclusive <i>Disaster: Day of Crisis</i>, and was also known to GameCube owners as the primary team behind <i>Baten Kaitos</i> and <i>Baten Kaitos Origins</i>.  Outside Nintendo, Monolith was responsible for the Xenosaga series (which partially appeared as a remake on Nintendo DS); and prior to that, members of Monolith were responsible for <i>Xenogears</i> with Square Enix as well as the Chrono series&mdash;having departed Square after <i>Chrono Cross</i>.<br />
<br />
Bandai Namco will continue to hold a stake in the company and use it for planning and development.
