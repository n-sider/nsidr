Hudson Entertainment has announced their initial batch of games for Wii's Virtual Console feature, which allows console owners to purchase games over the Internet.  By the end of the year, Hudson will have the following titles available:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Bonk's Adventure</i></li>
  <li><i>Super Star Soldier</i></li>
  <li><i>Victory Run</i></li>
  <li><i>Bomberman 93</i></li>
  <li><i>Dungeon Explorer</i></li>
  </ul><br />
Each above title will cost Wii owners 600 Wii points to purchase, which is equivalent to US$6.<br />
<br />
Hudson has plans to offer over 40 games over the next year, including third-party titles, that were originally released for the TurboGrafx-16.  The Virtual Console is, at least for now, primarily to be home for classic titles presented in emulated form, but Nintendo has confirmed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1880">it will also have new games</a> eventually, presumably smaller or lower-budget titles that may not sell well through traditional retail channels.
