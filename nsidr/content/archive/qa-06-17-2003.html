What is the release date for MK:DD?

<p><b>Josh:</b> The official word from Nintendo is only "Q4 2003". Look for a strategic release positioned near the holiday season.

<hr><h3>Viewtiful Joe</h3>

Hey guys,
   <br>      I guess my question this week is more of a ramble.  What is it with everyone showing so much love towards Capcom's Viewtiful Joe?  Sure, I have the preview disc, and I've played the demo a few times, and from beginning to end it doesn't seem like a solid concept.  The graphics are trying to be rough so I wont cut them down.  The slow/fast forward aspect is nifty at first, but as far as I can tell it's just button smashing nonsense with a lot of jumping.  
<p>
         I'm sure I'm setting myself for the "don't judge a game until you've played the finished version" response but I'm just wondering what's up since this game seems to be receiving mad praise from multiple websites.  Any thoughts?

<p><b>Josh:</b> Everyone has different tastes, and some people simply cannot force themselves to enjoy a particular game, even if it is highly acclaimed. Though I -- and probably many others -- would call you on several of your points (the graphics are actually very impressive, etc.), it is ultimately up to you to decide what you like. I don't think you are overlooking something from the demo that would cause your opinion to change, but I would encourage you to at least rent the final version. It may grow on you. If not, oh well -- whatever suits your tastes.


<hr><h3>Good games on the horizon?</h3>

Hello,<br>
My "America's Army" username is Vicious RDS ("Cowboy Bebop" rocks) so I'll go by that name. I'm wondering about any noteworthy games that come out before September that you guys can tell me about.

<p><b>Josh:</b> On the first-party front (I'll assume you're referring to the GameCube here), we've got Wario World, F-Zero GX, and Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour (the latter two hit in very late August). Some third-party games you may want to pay attention to are Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, Mega Man Network Transmission, Sonic Adventure DX, XGRA, Gladius, and obviously, Soul Calibur II. That last one is a given, but as far as the rest of the third-party efforts listed here go, you should exercise caution; they all have the potential to be solid games, but I've heard fair enough criticisms about most of them as well. Still, even if you play it conservatively and only pick 3 or 4 games out of that list to get, you should be good to go until September.

<h3>The ever-popular "GBA VS. PSP"</h3>
<p>


<b>
I just want to give my 2 cents worth on the GSP(Gameboy SP) vs PSP debate that has exploded on the internet lately.  Just like you I think the PSP is a good thing; it'll keep Nintendo on their toes by delivering better software quality and help spur competitive pricing (maybe have game prices at$19-$24. instead of $29-$39).  However, I don't think that the PSP will dominate the handheld market like it does with the PS2.  Handheld games in general doesn't need insane amounts of memory or power to enjoy.  It is gaming on the go; when one has extra time not a massive time consuming at home effort. Second, I see PSP being priced at somewhere between $139.99-$159.99 (being sold at a loss); by that time Nintendo would have lowered their GSP by $69.99 w/free Zelda four swords game.  At that deal it's hard to justify PSP over the GSP; with GSP boasting more user base thus more software availability.  My prediction is that the PSP wil! l be outsold by a margin go 4:1 by the GSP.

<p><b>Josh:</b> Certainly, you have many valid points; however, I wouldn't underestimate Sony. I would expand on this, but it is currently being covered very well -- by both staff members and readers -- in our forum thread <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=003011">PSP v. GBA/GBA2 and the winner is... </a>. I encourage you and anyone else interested in this comparison to check it out.

<P><B>Mark:</b> Also, for people who still haven't read it or want a quick run-down of the early PSP/GBA happenings, check out the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=features/sonypsp1.htm">PSP: Friend or Foe?</a> editorial that I wrote on this subject.  Obviously the forum thread linked above has our staff and forum members latest thoughts, so my article can now serve as an introduction of sorts.
