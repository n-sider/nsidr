Brushing the stigma off was no easy task as competitors extrapolated the term "kiddy" into a marketing campaign against the company. That was then.  The now consists of a new Nintendo in the midst of a resurgence with a new internal campaign to develop software that appeals to the 18-60 demographic, female gamers, and non-gamers.<br><br>

It is probable that the development spark came from the successes of Animal Crossing and Wario Ware Inc. Of course Nintendo still has divisions and teams inside its two central offices (Kyoto and Tokyo) developing traditional sequels to the Mario, Zelda, and Donkey Kong franchises. Meanwhile, Nintendo has dedicated several of its R&D to push concepts and ideas specifically targeting the aforementioned demographics. <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=130">Hideki Konno</a>, manager and producer of EAD Software Development Group No. 1 produced the hit Nintendogs. <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=17">Katsuya Eguchi</a>, manager and producer of EAD Software Development Group No. 2 produced Animal Crossing. However, the biggest breakthrough in software has come from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=310">Shinya Takahashi's</a> EAD Software Development Group No. 5 in the form of Brain Age, Brain Age 2, Jam With The Band, and English Training DS. Here is a couple of demonstration videos courtesy of Shigesato Itoi's online magazine showcasing these new and valuable IPs from Nintendo.<br><br>
