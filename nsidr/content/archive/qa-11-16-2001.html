<p>Question:<br>
</b>Do the Q&amp;A questions suck this week?</p>
<i>
<p>Brent</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> Hey, Brent Childers our EIC sent us a question.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Should we answer it?</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> I don't know, I guess since this is the Q&amp;A, we kind of have
to.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> So lets look it over... *browses draft*</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Yup, seems so.. Our readers need to learn how to send in good
questions, Pete must have faked these QA's back when he did them.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Hey There N-siders.. I wanted to ask, When Will you start reviewing games?
Or GameCube games to be exact And Does N-sider have any connection with Fran
Mirabella from IGN Cube? If You guys do know him, tell him to bring back his old
haircut, it = makes hime look likw a Psycho...</p>
<i>
<p>Amit</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> Fran is our Owner/Director. Hes the wonderful guy that
founded N-Sider.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> But it's his evil (or is it good? I can't remember which one we
got) twin that works at IGN.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Lucky us eh?</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> As for game reviews, rest assured the day the gamecube is launched
we will start playing the games, and reviewing them. We'll have our standard
3-man team doing reviews for all major launch games.</p>
<b>
<hr>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>What about Too Human? Is it still in development or has it been canceled? I
was so looking forward to playing that game.</p>
<i>
<p>Monkeysmash</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> Too Human's still in development, but it's safe to assume we
wont be seeing much of it for the next little while as Eternal Darkness was
pushed back.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Where did you meet Miyamoto-San?</p>
<i>
<p>Shaw52</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> This one is for me I suppose.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> I would assume so, you're the lucky bastard that met him.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> I met him when I was on shore-leave in the dutch-east indies...
Thats where I got the cl-- wait a second.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> It was at E3, the Day 1 media breakfast. He sat down across from
us, and I yelled out 'ITS SHIGGY!'. I quickly went over to get a pic and
about 30 other gamers followed suit... not many people got their picture taken
with that gaming god.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> I even got pictures of Howard Lincoln and Mr. Arikawa...</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> And Peter Main.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Ok ok, quit braggin.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Hey, I wanted to know if you need to get a new RF Switch/RF Modulator for
the gamecube or if you could use the one used for the N64. Since you haven't
been able to do that in the past I would think that you can't but, I have heard
mixed answers.</p>
<i>
<p>Gibbs</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<i><br>
</i></b><i>Dean:</i> I believe they are the same, again, for backward-compatability.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Is the control pressure sensitive?</p>
<i>
<p>Rodrigo</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> Are monkies flying out of my butt?</p>
<p>Brenden: Hopefully not, the last time it happened was really scary.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Only the L and R buttons are pressure sensitive.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Have you guys herd anything on Killer Instinct or Castlevania for the
gamecube?</p>
<i>
<p>Clue1882</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> I haven't heard anything about Killer Instinct, but there
have been rumblings about a Castlevania game in the works.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Any chance of doom 2 coming out on GBA? Cya round.</p>
<i>
<p>Drunk Caterpillar<b><font SIZE="6"></p>
</font></b></i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> Hey, Dean! Check it out, it's Alex asking a dumb question.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Alex. You're a freak. I'm not answering this question. Don't think
that because we met this summer I'm going to answer it. I refuse to answer it.
Its so lame and stupid... Just like Alex.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Well, the GameCube launch was low key in Japan (read: tanked). I was
wondering how the little cube is doing over there now, did the initial shipment
sell out already? Why so little games over there? Looking at the list of games,
I wouldn't have bought a cube over there either. Japan is usually a good
indicator on how a console is going to do in the long run, doncha think?</p>
<i>
<p>Saul Santiago</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> The GCN didnt 'tank' in Japan per-se, it just sold how nintendo
expected. Nintendo didn't hype the machine like some other company we all
know...</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> I believe its selling steadily how it should be, It seems as if
Nintendo's focus this generation is heavily on the North American Market.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Yeah, it should be remembered that Nintendo doesn't have the
same market appeal here, in North America, that it does in Japan.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Do you think that Golden Sun for GBA is a game worth getting?</p>
<i>
<p>Rafael Lopez</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> Yes.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> If youre a big RPG fan, I definitely recommend it. Expect a
review from N-Sider in the near future.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Hello,</p>
<p>What do you people think of the new Zelda game for the gamecube? I personally
think it looks funny, in a good way.</p>
<i>
<p>Eric</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> Zelda, however it will turn out, will be revolutionary. I
absolutely love the cel-shaded look. All they have to do is change Link's model
and i'll be a happy man.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Same here, if they change Link's goofy face, I'll be very
pleased. Either way, its going to be great.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Which do you prefer, Sega's NFL 2k series or EA's Madden series? Just
wondering which to get. thanx!</p>
<i>
<p>Skyler Cornish</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> Sega sports are always better, in my opinion, because I feel
Sega is more dedicated. Sega = quality (sound familiar?) while EA, is broad, and
just meh. I would reccomend Sega Sports, but the real test is rent them both,
and see which you like better.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Dude, Im not going to put meh into the Q&amp;A.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Yes, you are.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Aye aye!</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Good boy.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>This Cas Ra game for Gamecube by Konami, any chace it's a new</p>
<p>castlevania game? I heard something about it on another website and was</p>
<p>wondering if you knew anything about it. Thanks, keep up the excellent</p>
<p>work!!</p>
<p><br>
<i>Sergio Correia</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> Thanks for the compliments.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> The Cas Ra game is being developed by Capcom, not Konami... so I
highly doubt it would be a Castlevania game.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Compliments? there was only one there dumbass.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Don't make me bring out the penguin.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Hh crap his box is empty.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> NO!!!</p>
<p>*silence*</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Good penguin.</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>Hey, I was just wondering why the &quot;Gallery&quot; menu at the top
doesn't seem to work. I wanted to see some nice Nintendo fan art, but there was
none to be found there.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work.</p>
<i>
<p>Lucas</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> Dean, that's your field of expertise... things not getting
done.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Well, maybe it doesnt like you... did you try to touch it in its
bathing suit area?</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> The gallery is very touchy about stuff like that.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> He'll be up when he's ready to Its almost like Galleria-Viagra,
takes a while to kick in</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Not that I'd know about that, of course</p>
<p>Brenden: No Of course not</p>
<hr>
<b>
<p>Question:<br>
</b>do u guys sell hubcaps for a '72 pinto hatchback?</p>
<i>
<p>Zgemar1660</p>
</i><b>
<p>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> Brenden is N-Sider's baglady. I'm sure he's got something in
his magical bag of mystery.</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Hey!</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> I'm the bagman, thank you very much.</p>
<i>
<p>Dean:</i> Whatever. Did you find one?</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> *rummaging sounds*</p>
<i>
<p>Brenden:</i> Yep, here we go, a hubcap for a '72 Pinto. Ill send it as
soon as I can.</p>
