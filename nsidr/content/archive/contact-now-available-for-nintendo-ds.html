"In short, it's an altogether enjoyable and entertaining adventure with a few rough spots. Its high-concept nature never translates into pretentiousness -- on the contrary, the English script is by turns hilarious and intriguing. Despite its imperfections, it's unique, daring, and occasionally strange. Even if Contact turns out not to be your kind of game, you owe it to yourself to at least find out for yourself."</div><br />

"For anyone looking for Wi-Fi support, Contact allows players to link with their friends and share data, putting a virtual representation of each other in the game. It isn't online co-op, but it's a fun little extra just the same. The game's music is solid, and the presentation makes a fun (though sometimes a bit shallow) use of the two DS screens. It may not be for everyone, but if you're looking for something unique, immersive, and unconventional, Contact is calling you."</div><br />
