<p>EA has released some of the storyline for the upcoming <i>GoldenEye: Rogue Agent</i> first-person shooter for GameCube.  Instead of playing as James Bond, players will instead take the role of the villains.</p>

<p><blockquote><i>As an aspiring 00 agent dismissed from MI6 for reckless brutality, the player is hired as an enforcer by Auric Goldfinger, the wealthy super-villain with a lust for all things gold. Goldfinger is locked in a ruthless war against his archenemy, the brilliant scientist Dr. No. The prize is control of the world's greatest criminal organization. A brutal encounter with Dr. No costs the player an eye, but Goldfinger's technicians replace it with a gold-hued, synthetic eye, earning the player the name 'GoldenEye'.</i></blockquote></p>
