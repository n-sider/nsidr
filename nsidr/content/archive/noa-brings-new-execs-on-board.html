Nintendo has announced two new execs will be joining the fray at NOA, likely as part of the restructuring that has seen the departure of longtime corporate mainstays Beth Llewelyn, George Harrison, and Perrin Kaplan.  Both new execs will be based out of Nintendo's new Silicon Valley offices in Redwood Shores, California.<br />
<br />
Coming on-board as executive VP of sales and marketing is former Yahoo! chief marketing officer Cammie Dunaway.  Dunaway takes responsibility for marketing in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, filling the probably-huge shoes NOA president Reggie Fils-Aime left unoccupied when he accepted his current position.<br />
<br />
Among Dunaway's credits are the curiously-named 2006 Gold Reggie Award from the Promotional Marketing Association.  (The significantly less-amusing truth of the award's name is that it is derived from "cash register"&#8212;think "cha-ching", not "kicking ass" or "taking names".)  Dunaway will report to Fils-Aime.<br />
<br />
Shigeyuki Takahashi joins NOA as executive VP on special assignment, coming off a stint as president of Nintendo Research, Inc. where he was responsible for investigating Nintendo expansion opportunities in North America.  Takahashi will report to NOA chairman and CEO Tatsumi Kimishima.
