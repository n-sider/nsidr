<p>Amongst the craziness of today's April Fool's jokes (as well as <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/">our own</a>), we decided to inform our loyal readers that we will indeed be producing a DVD for this year's E3 show.</p>

<p>In the coming days, pre-orders will open up for the DVDs at the low price of $6 with free worldwide shipping. And the expected ship date will be within  the month of May.</p>

<p>Without further delay, click <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/media/e3_trailer.wmv">here</a> to view the trailer (WMV Format, 2.5MB)</p>
