The EX3 Ron Sandwith Teen Center, the first permanent teen center in Federal Way, officially opens September 17 with a Teen Launch Party highlighted by a Nintendo video games tournament. Several companies have contributed to the project including Bank of America, The Boeing Company, Capital One Services, Microsoft Corporation and Nintendo. <br>

Nintendo's contributions include a high-tech video game lounge called Nintendo
Zone.  "EX3 is a great way to keep teens off the streets while the Nintendo Zone contributes to its allure and will be a lasting presence at the facility," said the press release.  "The high-tech Nintendo Zone is equipped with plasma screens and the latest gaming systems.  The video game library offers teens the opportunity to check out games and will be continually updated with the newest and best Nintendo products."  The center will host a Mario Kart: Double Dash!! Tournament for teens ages 13 - 19 with the winner of the tournament receiving a Nintendo prize package.
