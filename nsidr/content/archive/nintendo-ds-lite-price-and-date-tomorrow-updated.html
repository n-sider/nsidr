<p>Nintendo will divulge the North American release date and price for the Nintendo DS Lite handheld tomorrow morning, according to <a href="http://ds.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=3473">AdvancedMN.com</a>.  Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> will include the information in his speech which begins at 10:30AM PST.  Word has it Nintendo will continue production of the original Nintendo DS model even after Lite has hit store shelves.  It's suspected Nintendo will do similarly as it did with the Game Boy Advance after the upgraded Game Boy Advance SP released and continue selling the Nintendo DS unit but at a reduced price.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697671p1.html">IGN</a> has posted pictures of inside Nintendo's GDC booth.  Several DS games are on display and Nintendo is using the new Nintendo DS Lite to show them off. </p>
