Nintendo has released a new system update for their Wii console which can be accessed by choosing the system update option from Internet-connected Wiis.  One might also select "update" on the placeholder screens for the Forecast or News Channels.<br />
<br />
Upon completion the updater purports to have made parental controls available, but this reporter found no differences in the menus or options post-update.<br />
<br />
More as it develops, if my mom lets me back online.
