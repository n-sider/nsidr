<p>Animal Crossing community site <a href="http://www.animalxing.com">Animal Crossing Ahead</a> has posted <a href="http://www.animalxing.com/articles/acdsdemo.php">a hands-on account</a> with Nintendo's upcoming <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a> from the DigitalLife expo.</p>

<p>From the account, a few new details can be gleaned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nintendo has apparently settled on "Tag Mode" as the new name for their wireless broadcast feature, which will make an appearance in the game.  (The feature first appeared in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967">Nintendogs</a>).</li>   <li>The game appears to feature a hybrid plant breeding system; no details are yet known.</li>
<li>House placement, previously known to be no longer restricted to one acre, is determined by the questions you answer when you start a new game.</li>
  </ul>
