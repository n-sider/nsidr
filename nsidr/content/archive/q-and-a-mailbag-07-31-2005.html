<p><b>Edition: 07-31-2005</b>

<p>Only two weeks! Thats not TERRIBLE. Not good, but not too horribly late. Cut me some slack guys. Jeez. But anyway, I am pretty happy with the variety of letters we got this week. In any case, be sure to send your questions, criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>. The more good letters I get, the more motivated I am to publish the next edition!

<p>In this edition, GTA takes some heat, people try and make fun of us, I try (desperately) to find new ways to insult N-Siders Brandon Daiker, someone hates me (Jeff) for backsassing his Zelda Voice ideas, people want to play Genesis on their Revolution, someone thinks 2D games are better than 3D, and MORE!

<h3>GTA in Hot Coffee</h3>
<p>Hi there!
<p>There's one thing I don't understand, and still don't after reading those stories: If this mod ist downloadable, and not even an official addition, why is the original game's rating affected? The Sims, Tomb Raider, and dozens of other game had nude patches or similar stuff before, yet the didn't get an AO...

<p>And on the other hand... there were a lot of sex scenes in the Larry games, and nobody cared...
 
<p>Regards, 

<p><i>- Markus</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Hey Mark, glad to see you checked out some of the stories I linked to about the recent <a href= https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1050>Grand Theft Auto fiasco</a>. Its a very touchy subject, but the problem is that the minigame is within the original code of the game. Every copy of <i>GTA: San Andreas</i> had this minigame within it, just not unlocked for normal play. Whether or not you have to download a small patch to unlock it or not is irrelevant: its still there. The copy of GTA that the ESRB ratings board reviewed contained this hidden pornographic minigame. So the real problem is that Rockstar deceived the ratings board by keeping this content within the game code (and the developers DID know it was there) without showing it to the board. 

<p>The ESRB doesnt actually play the games through when they rate them. How it works is that game makers send in a very detailed description of what the game is about as well as video of selected scenes and portions of the game that are deemed most offensive. That information and footage is then reviewed by a team of raters. This entire system has, thus far, relied on the honesty of game developers and publishers to provide an accurate representation of the material within their games. By including this minigame in GTA and not informing the ESRB of that, Rockstar broke that trust and it will have repercussions for the industry.

<p>The sad thing is that the ESRB rating system is actually applauded and hailed as the best entertainment ratings systems by the FTC. I am glad that Rockstar and Take Two will be hurting in their pocketbooks for this. Its not an issue of the content alone. Its an issue of deceit in an industry of self-regulation. It shouldnt be tolerated.

<h3>Sega, Genesis, Revolution.</h3>
<p>I love the site man, it's beautiful.<br>
I actually even mentioned this site in my article at N-Next:
<a href=http://www.n-next.com/revedit.php>http://www.n-next.com/revedit.php</a>
 
<p>Anyway, I want to know, what do you think about Yuji Naka's speaking with higher ups at Sega, to get Master System and Genesis/MegaDrive and possibly other popular Sega games, on Nintendo's back catalog service.
 
<p>In my honest opinion, it would attract a large group of gamers, and old gamers who haven't been in the game since them days. Sega should take the initiative, and get into talks with Nintendo on doing so.
Well, thats my opinion. What do you guys think?

<p><b>Travis: </b>Assuming this is true, I think its incredibly awesome.  Thats what I think.  I actually owned a Sega Genesis instead of a SNES back in the day (Im a heathen, I know) and would love access to the full library.  Sega didnt have the major hits Nintendo did, but it still had some really good games.  Its a shame theres no talk of Dreamcast games being apart of the service, however.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Im with both of you; I think having Genesis (and possibly Master System) games would be awesome. However, I havent heard anything more than faint rumors about this. Id like to think that Nintendo and Sega would both be onboard with this and are talking right now, but my better judgment is rallying against that thought. Nevertheless, I am very certain that if Nintendo is successful with this idea and doesnt approach Sega, someone else will.

<h3>Stapler</h3>
<p>Jeff,

<p>Hi.  I'm really sorry if I came across as attacking your statement (<a href= https://www.nsidr.com/columnview.php?columnid=131>"Nintendo needs to...", 16-Jul Q&A</a>).  That wasn't the intent at all.  Basically, I just started the number tallying on a whim and wanted to share it with somebody.  I can understand how, given the context, you would consider singling out your statement an attack.  But, honestly, I didn't even care to look who wrote it.

<p>If I were to attack you, it would be regarding the lack of updates.  It took so long for you to reply to my letter, the totals had changed!

<p><i>- GJM</i>

<p>P.S. (I only jest.)
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Ah, good to know. In any case, the bulk of my response was dedicated to debunking your entire letter. I wasnt nearly as concerned about its application to me. Still, I didnt make you Letter of the Week for nothing. As for the lack of mailbag updates, I blame Heart Containers Brandon Daiker. His genuine lackadaisical attitude is contagious! I just knew I had to get in on that action. 

<p>I recently caught up with Brandon at the N-Sider offices and asked him about life at N-Sider. He didnt really answer me, since he was on the phone with someone, but heres what he said anyway:

<p> [<i>talking on the phone</i>] And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were merry, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire...

<h3>Revolutions Release Date</h3>
<p>Dear N-Sider staff,
 
<p>I am strongly concerned with the release date of the Revolution.  I noticed in your last mailbag Jeff predicted that it would come out in about 1.5 years.  I remember I read off a statement of some Nintendo representative marking off on how they may replicate the DS's launching strategy of launching the Revolution in November- of 2006 of course.  That, with how Nintendo has been teasing us with how amazing and the revolutionary the Revolution is going to be for a whole year, only to tell us at this last E3 that they never even finished the controller, and the fact that I can't imagine how far the games really have been able to come without the controllers features (despite the fact that you can work on the games using the GCN's similar-to-Revolution technology), and it seems the Revolution will not only 'trail a little bit behind' its competitors, but be rather late.  Really late. 
I told my friend that I suspect that November 2006 is when the Revolution would be launched.  He called me crazy for it and that it would more likely launch in the summer months of 2006.  Then, later, after my conversation with him, where he was gone and not able to communicate with me, allowing me to think a little bit more, I thought that even if it did launch in the summer months of 2006, it would most likely launch in Japan first (unless Nintendo decided to launch it here first like with the DS, or do a worldwide simultaneous launch, though I can't totally see them doing that), and then hit here in fall of 2006.  And if it does launch in Japan of November 2006, then... when would it launch here?  Maybe I'm being a bit anxious about this issue, but just thinking about what will be going on at that time- I'm just entering my sophmore year in high school, and I could not visualize that the Revolution would launch when I'm in my Junior year... it just doesn' t seem right. 

<p>I do think this matters, because obviously being too late does matter.  I can't imagine that the Revolution is going to be so revolutionary that everyone is actually going to have to get one after the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are out so long.  I mean, the Revolution launching nearly, or about a whole year after the Xbox 360?  That either shows that Nintendo really means what it says in regard to not competing with Microsoft, or that they were really not pre-prepared for going into this next generation console war. 
I wouldn't mind a reply to my... concerns, if you will.
 
<p>Sincerely,

<p><i>- LSN</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Its certainly understandable to be concerned about the Revolutions release date when you see all of the Sony/Microsoft fans getting hyped about their consoles.  Right now though it is best to keep faith in Nintendo.  Last I heard Nintendo still maintained they would launch when their competition did.  Obviously this will be after the release of the Xbox 360, but it can still launch around the same time as the PS3.  Im actually reminded of the console launches of this generation.  The PS2 was a year ahead of everyone (excluding the ill-fated Dreamcast, of course) and the GameCube launched almost simultaneously with the Xbox a year later.  So really, you dont have too much to worry about.  Nintendo, in my opinion, seems more on top of things than it did last time.  Frankly, I think Microsoft is being hasty, launching ahead of everyone just because it worked out for the PS2 last time.

<p>My current prediction is an August release for the Nintendo Revolution.  I base this on pure instinct and not on any logical speculation whatsoever.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>I believe that Revolution will launch around November of 2006. The Xbox 360 will have been out for about a year by that time. But theres little anyone can do about that. Microsoft is determined to launch this year, cutting short the current console generation. Why? Because it isnt making money off of the Xbox. Irregardless, I think that the PlayStation 3 launch will mirror the PS2, with the system launching in Japan in early to mid 2006 and hitting North American shelves around November. Nintendo will probably launch the Revolution simultaneously in America and Japan. Unless Im way off on all of this, I really dont see the issue with Nintendo launching in late 2006. Truth be told, it isnt when they launch that will determine their success. Its what they do with that launch and the subsequent year.

<h3>RE: Zelda Voices</h3>
<p>I'm a bit annoyed by the implication that I have "no confidence" in a company because I don't blindly believe that can pull everything off. The comment was accustative and backhanded. Let's face it, despite how much I like Nintendo, I would find it hard pressed to say that they're responsible for some of the best voice acting around in their major franchises (outside of Charles Martinet, perhaps, but it's not like he says more than random catchphrases).

<p>If someone honestly thinks the voice of Toad in the Super Mario games is good and/or fitting, I think they're lying through their teeth. I'm sure Nintendo would be far more stringent about a Zelda related voice over process, but I am not for a second going to kiss their butt in the process. There's a difference between being cautiously optimistic and blind.

<p>As for the Star Trek comment... okay? They're still speaking another language regardless of whether or not their is a transcoder present. That would have the same function as listing English words in a Zelda game with a Hyrulian voice over, so what's the difference? It doesn't really change the fact they're generally *not* speaking English or the fact that you can readily buy dictionaries for those languages (Klingon, for example).

<p><i>- Tony Jacobs</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Perhaps I came off a little harsh. The point I was trying to make is that you are melding two completely separate issues into one case. The issue of whether or not the Zelda series should ever have voices is not the same as whether or not you believe Nintendo can do those voices justice. If youd like to debate on whether or not Nintendo is capable of doing voice acting any justice, then fine, lets rumble. But if they cant do voices justice, I dont believe they can do some made up language any justice either. Being against Nintendos lack of skill in voice acting shouldnt impair your ability to either be for the <i>idea</i> of voice acting in a Zelda game (assuming its done right) or against it. Thats the point I was trying to make. 

<p><b>Travis: </b>I think the voice of Toad in Super Mario games is good and/or fitting.

<h3>A Point-and-Click Rebirth?</h3>
<p>Hi guys!
 
<p>I've been reading your site for about..oh six months or so now and I LOVE it!  I particularly enjoy the humorous answers to letters..and the humorous letters themselves. 
 
<p>I just want your opinion and analysis of an idea I recently cooked up.  Do you remember the "point-and-click" adventure games on the PC of yester-year?  I mean classics like King's Quest V-IX, heck, even the original KQ games would be cool.  Wouldn't the DS's touch screen and graphical ability make a perfect match for these classic style games?  In a company that is starved for RPGs (yeah, Nintendo needs MORE!) I think that this could really breathe another giant gust of wind into the new handheld.  Its certainly a unique way of using the touch screen, plus it would keep folks entertained for hours, just as KQ2 did for me so many years ago. 
 
<p>Have any thoughts on the idea? 
 
<p><i>- Jason</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>I wholeheartedly agree with you.  I had a long and steamy affair with the Kings Quest franchise years ago and would love it to return in some capacity.  In fact, I just want a re-release of Grim Fandango for the DS.  That would be swell.  On the bright side, I think the as yet unreleased <i>Trace Memory</i> (seen below) will, at the very least, have some point-and-click adventure elements so you may want to keep an eye out for it.</p>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>What I wouldnt give for a Nintendo DS Sam & Max adventure. Those were the days. Maybe a sequel to <i>The Dig</i>, <i>Full Throttle</i>, or another Monkey Island as well. One can only hope.

<h3>ZELDAS MARIOS</h3>
<p>Why is everyone sold on the new Zelda?Actually it looks just like Ocarina with better graphics!why do people say this Zelda looks more mature?look at his costume look at his face he looks like kiddie anime manga toy Link and not what I consider a mature Link!wtf are they thinking?throwing around the same characters for over 15 years but still wondering how it comes they are the least successful of the bunch!and when they see gamecube is dying cause nobody wants to play mario3487,mario party5789,mario golf2413,mario this and mario that pokemon,kirby,luigis ghost stories,donkey monkey,and all that recycled shit from thousand years ago they still don't learn their lessons and keep on releasing the same shit over and over again as if they were running around with shoppingbags strapped on their heads!Yes we all loved those games when we were kids cause they were new to us!It seems like Nintendo is thinking the whole world is 12 years old!and when you think it can't get any worse Nintendo strikes back in the newest issue of EGM telling the world how they want to make another thousand zeldas and marios and luigis and pikmins I tell you I rather be flying around in the fog of superman64 than wasting my time with ancient stuff like that!If I want shit like that I go to museum and save some money!What the fuck happened to Geist it is in development longer than I am on this planet an it still looks exactly like in the very first pictures I saw of it!they are probably to busy playing mary kate and ashley than giving resi4 a run for it's money at least in the visual department!I mean come on look at some of the levels in Rebel Strike,Prime,resi4 and then you can come and sell me this as gamecube graphics and tell me how much more powerful the xbox is!Everyday we hear new anouncements only for ps3 and xbox:Resi5,Final Fantasy,Ridge Racer,Valve support,Bioware suppoert,ID support,Criterion support,Too Human only for Bill Gates,Scarface,Godfather,Gta,Tecmo support,Namco support,Lucasarts support,Factor5 only for Ps3,etc.!And now hold your breath:Nintendo owners get a brand new CHRYSTAL CRONICLES lol lol lol it's almost like christmas and birthay combined thank you Nintendo!and if that wasn't enough already we get a brand new Metroid Prime also for Revolution running on gamecube hardware!you couldn't ask for more these days!this is my love letter to Nintendo!

<p><i>- Sassi</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>OMG. You are such a tool.

<p><b>Travis: </b>I dont know what made it more obvious, your misinformation or your poor grammar, but you are one misguided fellow.  If you had looked over the <a href= https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=466>N-Depth on <i>Twilight Princess</i></a> that Chris and I put together, you would know very well why the game is dark and how it has nothing to do with the fact that the graphical effect is now more realistic compared to <i>The Wind Waker</i>.  <i>Twilight Princess</i> is dark because of what happens. 
 
<p>I can tell, though, that youre not one that listens to anybody else (unless theyre the friends that hold your peer pressure leash).  I will say this much, however.  While the mainstream gamers are after PlayStations and Xboxes, military shooters and murder simulators, they always stop and notice when Zelda returns. Why? Because they know that Zelda is business.  You can even watch a channel like G4, which mostly caters to the mainstream gamer mindset, and when theyre done making fun of Nintendo they still pay attention when Zelda comes around. 
 
<p>Do some fact checking before you insult Nintendo.  They may be in need of third-party support, among other things, but something they have always succeeded in doing is producing outstanding games.  The reason Nintendo isnt <i>dead</i> is because their games sell so well.  Metroid is intrigue, Zelda is adventure, Mario is fun.  And that wont change any time soon.

<h3>I Want My FMV</h3>
<p>Hey N-Sider

<p>I've been keeping my eye on the last AAA GameCube game besides Twilight Princess and that is undeniably Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance. At last Ninty are finally bringing their 1st-party equivalent to Final Fantasy to Western gamers on the first time on home console.

<p>Upon watching multiple trailers for the game I was struck quite hard at the FMV scenes. I mean come on this is a Nintendo game. Very rarely do Nintendo use FMV in a game. Even more so was the fact that it was a totally new style of FMV I've never seen Square Enix or anyone else do before. I like to call it Realistic Cel-Shading. If your reading this and ain't seen the FMV in Path of Radiance find a Japanese trailer NOW!! 

<p>I would like to ask you guys to PLEASE find the source of these FMV scenes in Path of Radiance. I doubt Intelligent Systems are responsible as they have never put FMV in any of their games before. Could it be linked to the fact that Nintendo are right now making FMV movies like Square Enix are with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children? The Revolution will play DVD's with an attachment so I'm sure Ninty are gonna be making some movies in the consoles life time.

<p>This all leads to that Q with an answer a lot of gamers are splint on. Could there possibly be an Eigi Aonuma directed, internally made, FMV Zelda movie in the near future. I mean ever since Eigi Aonuma became series director there has been many more cut-scenes and more narrative in Link's quests. That backed by the fact that he is a big fan of Miyazaki's animes like Spirited Away.

<p>So guys, what have you got to say?

<p><i>- Galvin Okoye</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>It does look pretty, thats for sure. You are right; Nintendo does usually outsource its FMV (Full Motion Video) work. However, Ive been unable to figure out exactly who is responsible for the FMV in Fire Emblem. I wish I could help you more on that front. Perhaps well be able to find out more as the game comes closer to a North American release.</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mailbag_07-31-2005_1.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; background: #99CCFF; padding: 2px; border: 1px solid black; border-top: none;">Do <i>you</i> know who made this?</td></tr></table>
<br>


<p>As for your second question, I dont think Eiji Aonuma will be directing a movie anytime soon. There is a big difference between game and movie directing. Honestly, I dont see any Zelda movie happening for a while. Nintendo is always unpredictable, but I think it will enter the animated movie business very cautiously and strategically. The most important items on Nintendos agenda in the coming years are the Nintendo DS and Revolution. I can wait for a Zelda movie.

<h3>Letter of the Week</h3>
<p>Great games are great games regardless of cutting edge technology and that has always been the case. Yet very few developers including even Nintendo spend as much time on polishing every single area of a game as they did at the pinnacle of the 16bit era, and even though modern and more technically advanced games could easily be just as great and even superior, they very rarely are, and in fact often fall short of their 16bit counterparts in all-round quality and polish. Sometimes the graphics are great but the games are too short or limited to be worth the high price, or the game designs are brilliant but the games lack in overall graphical or audio sophistication to make the whole package all round of the highest quality and appeal, and so on.

<p>I think games like Super Mario Bros 3, Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Super Punch Out, F-Zero or even some more modern games (and some of them are still classic 2D designs) like Goldeneye and Advance Wars, are some of the best games ever and are as playable as any modern graphically superior game. In fact I would argue that very few games have come to the near perfect all-round design of those examples, especially given the time they were made and the platforms they were made for.

<p>It's a pity that even Nintendo seems to find it difficult to match the level of overall quality and polish it achieved during the SNES era with its newer 3D versions of franchises or original game designs.

<p>It seemed in the days of the SNES it was all about making every single aspect of a game near perfect, rather than polishing one area at the expense of others or focusing on trying to introduce something new into every game iteration over cleaning up the solid ideas that were there already to near perfection.

<p>Now, again, Nintendo seems to want to focus on overall quality, and this appears to be the case with every area of Revolution, from the design and build quality and the way all aspects of it work in harmony, to the cheap cost, user friendliness and universal appeal. Hopefully this philosophy also applies to the new games they have in development for Revolution.

<p>Nintendo seems to have looked at the likes of Apple as well as its own company history and taken on board what it needs to appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers yet still maintain the highest level of quality, to truly succeed in the coming years. I hope I am right about this, and I hope Nintendo is on the same wavelength, because I think all round excellence and quality is what makes something truly great and have enduring appeal.

<p>I hope, for all of us.

 <p><i>- Kirk Johnston</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>I like you, Kirk Johnston. You bring up some valid points. However, I respectfully disagree on a few fronts. Instead of answer though, Im handing the reigns to James. He can usually sum up my opinion much more eloquently than I could ever hope to.

<p><b>James: </b>You know, I often see people mention that they felt games generally became worse when they moved into three dimensions.  In some ways I agree, but not entirely.

<p>Obviously, a three dimensional game is fundamentally different to a two dimensional game.  It's not just a visual upgrade; the basic foundations are very different.  If you look at <i>Super Mario 64</i>, you can see that the structure of the game is totally different to its predecessors.  Presumably, Nintendo struggled with this issue for quite a while.  I know that Shigeru Miyamoto recently commented on the difficulty of introducing a 2D classic to the realm of 3D gaming.  Where Mario and Zelda have generally made a strong transition (especially Zelda), other franchises haven't (including Sonic - and I'm a huge Sonic fan).

<p>Do games generally have less polish now?  I'm not so sure.  It would have been much easier to polish up a 2D game, by its very nature (less staff required, shorter development time, less cost, simplicity relative to 3D games).  But even then, don't forget that we saw a lot of garbage during the 8 and 16-bit days.  I think people tend to look back on that time with rose-colored glasses, but they forget that, just like today's industry, there was a whole lot of rubbish floating around.

<p>Still, I think quality has always been intrinsically linked to Nintendo's products.  No matter what the era, I don't think Nintendo has ever really slouched when it came to quality.  Of course, there are exceptions.  But take a look at GameCube as an example - intelligent hardware design and generally very good games from Nintendo itself.  Even <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, which disappointed a lot of people, was nonetheless a highly polished game.  I think it was only received somewhat badly due to the incredibly high expectations.  But I don't think there's any doubt that it was significantly better than most platformers out there at the time.  In any case, I don't know if Nintendo is necessarily "re-focusing" on quality -- I think they've always been quality-focused, pretty much.  But certainly, <i>Twilight Princess</i> seems to be an attempt to make up for the rushed latter part of <i>The Wind Waker</i> (the Triforce quest).

<p>It's difficult to form a conclusion on this issue of whether or not games are significantly better or worse than they used to be, because in many ways it's simply impossible to make comparisons.  You could say that games now are worse because they often have camera issues and clipping problems, but these issues were largely irrelevant in 2D games for obvious reasons (ie: not because of better design, but because of the nature of 2D games themselves).  However, I like to think that games are always improving, even though we do get the copycats and the general glut of awful titles each year.

<p>The only thing I particularly disagree with in your letter (and in many comments that I see) is the comparison to Apple.  On a surface level, perhaps Apple is comparable to Nintendo.  But generally, I see more contrasts than correlations.  You could argue that both companies are committed to quality and simplicity -- I'd probably agree with you there.  But Nintendo's products usually carry a mass-market price tag, whereas Apple's products generally tend to be quite pricey (including software).  Bear in mind, I'm a happy customer of both Nintendo and Apple, but I've never quite grasped the frequent comparisons between the two companies, other than on a very thin surface level.
