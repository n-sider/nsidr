GS-Line, a brand for casual games from publisher JoWooD, adheres to a philosophy of quality at an affordable price. Their goal is to create games that are fun without being violent and that appeal to children, young gamers, and families.<br />
<br />
JoWooD has released two games under GS-Line so far, both for PC: <i>Dawnspire</i> and <i>Flyboys</i>. They are currently looking forward to two DS releases, as well: <i>My Little Flufties</i>, which appears to be a game about blindingly cute creatures, and <i>Lifesigns: Surgical Unit</i>, the game that inspired <i>Trauma Center</i>. JoWooD hopes to release nine to twelve new games per year through GS-Line and will focus on projects for Wii, DS, PC, and Xbox 360.<br />
<br />
JoWooD and GS-Line will be present at the Games Convention for developers to present their ideas. Product manager Richard Haderer will also be available for any questions developers might have.<br />
<br />
This year's Games Convention takes place in Leipzig, Germany from August 22 to 26.
