<p>Electronic Arts has released <i>Burnout Legends</i> for Nintendo DS, and EA has said that it supports Wi-Fi multiplayer, making it the third title (following <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a> and <i>Tony Hawk's American Sk8land</i>) that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for online play.</p>

<P>According to EA, the title was built from the ground up for the Nintendo DS and features nine gameplay modes, including rash, road rage, pursuit and Wi-Fi multiplayer.  The title is rated E by the ESRB and has an MSRP of $34.99.  Oddly, as of press time, it does not seem to have garnered any reviews at GameRankings.com.</p>
