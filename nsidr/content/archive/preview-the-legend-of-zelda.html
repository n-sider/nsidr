  <p><font size="1"><b>Miscellaneous Notes:</b><br>
  <p>Mitsuhiro Takano worked as a scenario writer on The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. When former director Eiji Aonomu was assigned to a new project, Takano gladly stepped in as the new Zelda director.</p>
  <p>The Legend of Zelda for GameCube was originally taking a much darker, more adult theme. However, Shigeru Miyamoto felt the direction Zelda was taking was too cliche. Although the change is quite drastic, Miyamoto reassured Zelda was still a work in progress, and the game would keep evolving until release</font>.</p>

To date, Virtual Boy is the only Nintendo console to not have been graced with a new <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> game. Therefore, it was no surprise that NCL had a <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> teaser in its demo reel at the recent Spaceworld 2000 event in Japan. What was shown on the large screen was a beautifully rendered scene with our beloved Link sword fighting his nemesis Ganondorf in an enormous castle hall.

As one of its most established franchises, Nintendo is expected to make a <i>Zelda</i> game on the Gamecube. In fact, Miyamoto-san confirmed in an interview last year that a <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> game was in the work for Nintendo's next-generation system. In the interview, the master affirmed that we would have to wait five years for it. What he most likely meant was five years from <i>The Ocarina of Time</i>, which puts the sequel on track for the year 2003. Whether this still holds true is unknown, but even if we don't get to play <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> on our Gamecubes for another three years, it will be more than worth the wait.

What makes me say that? No, I don't have access to footage other than that already shown to the public, and quite frankly, I don't think any exists yet. Anyone who remembers Nintendo's Shoshinkai event five years ago knows that the Nintendo 64 was unveiled at that show along with a playable <i>Super Mario 64</i> and video footage of upcoming games. One of the games on that video was <i>Zelda 64</i>, and what was shown was Link fighting a skeleton in true 3D. Back then the demo was nothing short of spectacular, but compared to the finished product, it doesn't look nearly as impressive. There is no reason to believe why this won't happen with the Gamecube title as well.

With that in mind, there is really no point in dissecting the Spaceworld 2000 demo to try to find any clues as to how the next <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> game will be like, as it was just that -- a demo and nothing else. There are even rumors around that suggest the demo was done very quickly as an afterthough. I fear we will have to wait quite some time to find any information about Link's new adventure. Until that info reaches us, we can always take a look at the footage shown to us so far and start dreaming about all the things that will make the next <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> game one of Nintendo's best ever.
