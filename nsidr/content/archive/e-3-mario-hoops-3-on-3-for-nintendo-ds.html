<p><ul>
<li>It's a whole new ball game as Mario rocks the rim on the Nintendo DS.
<li>Get that magic touch. There are plenty of basketball games out there, but none
with the hands-on control of Mario Hoops 3-on-3. Players use the touch screen to
get their game on as they execute tricky dribbles, special passes and sweet shots -
all with strokes and taps of the stylus.
<li>Players choose their teams of three characters from the Mario universe and hit the
parquet. Power-ups like Red Shells and Bob-ombs can turn the tide as they chase
down coins - they will affect the score, so players collect as many as they can as
they drive to the hoop.
<li>Whether playing against friends on a local wireless connection, jamming through
a tournament or just playing mini-games, there's a mode for everyone.
