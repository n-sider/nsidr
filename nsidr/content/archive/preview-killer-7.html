<b>Killer 7</b><br>
<font size="1">2003 Capcom</font>

<p>In November of 2002, Capcom and its Production Studio 4 announced five exclusive GameCube games in development.  Among those titles, was a stylish third-person shooter called <i>Killer 7</i>.  The game was described as a dark action game starring two killers.  <i>Killer 7</i> is a game about the struggles between two men whose paths develop into a tale of "fate, revenge, and altering personas".

<p>The lead is played by Harman Smith, a wheelchair-bound 65-year-old man with seven different personalities.  Appearances can be deceiving.  Harman may be an old man, but his seven personalities have allowed him to become the most feared killer in the world.  Some call him "Gold Killer".  Using these seven different characters, Herman will go up against Kun Lan, an old friend turned criminal mastermind. Kun Lan is the head of an organization called "God Hands" that turns people into vicious monsters with a "heaven's smile" - a sort of crazed and distorted grin on their otherwise blank face. At any moment, these people will become violent and start to form armies that can overthrow governments. They're also responsible for the death of Harman's wife, Suzy.

<p>Killer 7 will contain five storylines that span through four different worlds in two time periods, the present day and the year 2005.  The world of 2005 will change depending on what the main character does in the present-day period.

<p>Harman will utilize his seven personalities to fight Kun Lan.  Harman switches between his multiple personalities and uses each one's unique strengths and abilities to wage a war against those he considers deserving to die.   Each personality has a unique name, look, and specialty, as listed below:

<p><hr>
<b>Garcian Smith</b> - A man killed by Herman. Garcian has clairvoyant powers and is trusted by Herman to manage the rest of his personalities.

<p><b>Dan Smith</b> - A man with telekinetic powers that let him change a bullet's trajectory with a thought. He killed Herman four years ago.

<p><b>Masked Smith</b> - A retired wrestler who can use fire to become invincible.

<p><b>Coyote Smith</b> - Masked Smith's son. He has the power to teleport through objects.

<p><b>Con Smith</b> - A child with superior natural senses. Herman uses him to deliver false feelings of compassion.

<p><b>Kaede Smith</b> - A woman with the ability to make showers of deadly blood appear and who loves Coyote and Dan.

<p><b>Kevin Smith</b> - A new and mysterious Smith who has been given special orders by Herman.
<br><hr>

<p>Directed by Shinji Mikami and produced by Gouichi Suda, <i>Killer 7</i> is set to utilize the most stylish graphical style in a game yet.  The exact gameplay has yet to be divulged, although it looks to be a third-person shooter.  Regardless of what genre the game is placed in, screens and video suggest a lot of blood will be spilled.  There are various graphical effects that could potentially be incorporated into the gameplay.  However, Capcom has kept such information secret.

<p>The game looks to set a new standard in artistic presentation of video games and will be available <i>only</i> on GameCube.  <i>Killer 7</i> is scheduled for a Japanese winter 2003 release and an unspecified 2004 North American launch.

<p><b>Features</b><br>

<li>Play as seven different characters, each with their own unique abilities
<li>Cel-shading graphical style to enhance gameplay
  </ul>
