As is the Monday custom, new retro games now grace the Wii Shop Channel's Virtual Console section.  Today's offerings, which went live at 9 a.m. Pacific, are as follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Mighty Bomb Jack</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Final Fight</i> (Super NES, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Ordyne</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
The titles can be acquired via the Wii Shop Channel in exchange for the noted sums of Wii Points, which are available in various denominations at a price of about 100 for $1.
