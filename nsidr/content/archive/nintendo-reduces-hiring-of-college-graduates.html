<p>Polygon Mag has reported that, starting this spring, Nintendo plans to lower the number of college graduates it hires. The lagging Japanese video game market is said to be a reason behind the reduction.

<p><i>"According to a recent survey of companies based in Kyoto, Japan, Nintendo is one of eighteen companies which plan to reduce the number of new employees they hire."</i><b> - Dennis Day, News Editor at Polygon</b>
