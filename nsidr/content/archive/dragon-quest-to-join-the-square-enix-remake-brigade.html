According to IGN's Anoop Gantayat, at Square-Enix's financial briefing yesterday CEO Yoichi Wada revealed something <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/791/791082p1.html">potentially explosive</a> for Japan.<br />
<br />
When asked about Dragon Quest IX's release date during the Q&A session held after the briefing, Wada responded, "This summer, we'll release <i>Battle Road</i> in arcades and <i>Sword</i>[s? -Ed.] for the Wii. Following that, we're thinking of a release for 9 once we've released remake versions and so forth."<br />
<br />
Neither release dates nor possible systems were revealed, but we'll certainly let you know if we hear anything.
