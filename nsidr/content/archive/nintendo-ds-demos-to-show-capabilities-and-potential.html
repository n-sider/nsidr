<p>Below is a list of demos that will be playable tomorrow at the E3 show (in addition to the already confirmed titles Super Mario 64x4, Metroid Prime: Hunters, PictoChat WarioWare, etc.), according to NintendoInsider.com.  These were said to be created to show off the capabilities and potential of the Nintendo DS handheld.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Balloon Trip: A stork drops Baby Mario, and he falls through the sky. A touch of the screen creates clouds that maneuver him toward gold coins and away from enemies. This demonstrates how game designers could make games that let players create their own environments. Design a house for virtual characters. Or put obstacles in the way of opponents in a multiplayer game.</p>

<p>Carving: Pick a block of wood, steel or even a watermelon to spin on the lathe and carve away. Listen as the enhanced sound reacts to the different surfaces. Use the fine-point stylus for precision cuts, then rotate the object and see what is created. Imagine using tools like this to dig for treasure or make custom pieces for a virtual chessboard.</p>

<p>Marios Face: Grab hold of Marios nose and give it a stretch. Distort his ears, or steal Warios cap. Rotate the head or tap a button to switch it from cartoon shading to regular 3-D. Image manipulation like this has never been possible in hand-held games. Future games could employ pliable tools or characters, or let users customize characters to their own likenesses.</p>

<p>DS Pikachu: This gorgeous demo highlights the versatility of Nintendo DS by showcasing brilliant colors and switching the true 3-D view from screen to screen. Players use the stylus and touch screen intuitively to interact with Pikachu in a variety of different activities. Players can touch and pull Pikachus cheek directly, draw Pikachu posed or rub to shave off a scratch card.</p>

<p>Special Effects: This demo has three parts. In the first, press and slide the different dots to create trails of water, smoke, fire or any number of effects. In the second, transform the Nintendo DS into a beat box. Each square on the screen creates a different sound, while launching new fireworks-like effects on the other screen. Mix and match to get the right combo of light and sound. In the third part, sliding the boxes around one screen changes the wild geometric image on the other. These effects can all be applied to games in a virtually infinite number of ways.</p>

<p>Submarine: One screen shows the position of a sub in the water, while the other puts players at the helm. Tap and slide the controls to dive, pitch, and increase speed or fire torpedoes. Avoid depth charges, enemy subs and underwater boulders that block the sub from completing its mission. This demo clearly illustrates how the dual screens work together to give players views of the action they have never had before. Now just think how this two-perspective technology could enhance sports games, first-person shooters, racing games and more.</p>

<p>Table Hockey: The game is simple: Just hit the puck into the opponents goal. But notice how the puck reacts, depending on whether the stylus slides it quickly or slowly in different directions. And think about the wireless capabilities for games like this.</p>
