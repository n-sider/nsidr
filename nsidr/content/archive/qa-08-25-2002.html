Well, we're back. Hopefully you're all enjoying v3 and it's new look. But enough of that, let's get straight to the point. We asked for questions, demanding answers. We took those questions and answered them. It's like some kind of freaky internet magic, isn't it?</p>

<hr><b>
Props on getting the new website up and running. Fabulous job. On to my question...about Rare, what is your opinion on the situation with Rare? One website believes the reason why most of their games are being kept secret is because they're being created as online games - most notably regarding Perfect Dark Zero. I'd like to hear your feedback...thanx.
</b><br>
<i>-Bill</i>

<p><b>Jason:</b> When it comes to very hard to answer Rare questions, I have to always keep pointing people towards <a href="http://www.raretopia.com">www.raretopia.com</a>.  Our good friend Jeton Grajqevci runs the place, and I would trust his word on anything concerning our favorite Twycross-based developer.  My personal opinion is that Rare will indeed go third party but in small quantities.  Most of their resources will still be directed at GameCube, but some other titles will shift over to the competing platforms.  Thats just how I see it.  Once again, Raretopia is the place to go for those types of questions.

<p><b>Brenden:</b> You can really throw all the rumours around that you want. We keep covering this subject because it <i>seems</i> to keep changing. All we've been going on though is rumours. And no, I'm not in denial. Third-party status is a logical step for the company in many eyes and I'm inclined to agree. The main problem I have with the rumours is that people are worried about Rare "pulling a SEGA" and spreading their key titles out over many systems. This has resulted in a little "Internet Rare Hate" switch being flipped on. My personal opinion is that no matter the status of the relationship, Rare will continue to support Nintendo. Sure, I may be biased, but it should be in their best interest. Then again, that's nothing more than a prediction. Fuzzy things these rumours eh?

<hr><b>
Two questions.<br>
(1) What's it like working at N-Sider? Are you all buddies or do you wish to thwart the others attempts at good journalism?<br>
(2) How does one join the N-Sider team? Is it even humanly possible?
</b><br>
<i>-Frightened</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> 1) Ha! Buddies? ... ok, well, maybe I shouldn't be laughing at that. I don't know, it's more or less like a really dysfunctional family. A dysfunctional family that manages to get even more dysfunctional when something <b>big</b> is happening (like say... v3?).</p>

2) One joins the N-Sider team by exhibiting either great editorial skills or great artistic abilities. That's the general formula, some of us joined through other means, but you still need to be able to do at least one of those things to stick around. I never really considered myself to have either of those qualities, but you'd be amazed where you can get with a little hard work and determination, heh.

<p><b>Dean:</b> 1) Its fun, we are for the most part buddies, but as any 'family' we all
have our battles, which of course we are not short of ;) hehe, Being here
for 3 years has taught me to 'accept' the new views posed by the new
staffers, quite an interesting experience. And well, its almost a bit of
fandom too, you  get to know stuff before most others, and it makes you feel
smarter :)</p>

2) We're pretty good editorwise, but we're always looking for EXTREMELY
talented freehand artists for our universe project, so if you think you have
what it takes, send a sample to <a href="mailto:dean@n-sider.com">dean@n-sider.com</a> and i'll get back to you.

<p><b>James:</b> N-Sider is like any other site out there; sometimes we agree and sometimes we don't.  But even if we don't agree, it's never too serious.  We usually find a good compromise and move on.  </p>

As for working at N-Sider, I can only speak from my own experience.  In my view, we tend to hire people who demonstrate potential when it comes to writing/artwork.  I've never thought of myself as a really great writer, yet here I am.  So I'm proof that N-Sider gives everyone a chance. ^_^

<p><b>Mark:</b> 1) I like it :). I get to write about all the games that I love playing, and I get to advise people of what to look out for (i.e. the bad games).  And, I get to help people with their buying decisions in the audio/visual department.  Also, those in the v3 launch chat with us would have an idea how cool the rest of the guys are!  Drunken chatting, humour filled messages, and damn straight Nintendo know-how, these guys are cool! And Ive only been here a short while!

<p><b>Jason:</b> 1 Its a lot of fun with a lot of serious work involved.  Our staffers know their stuff when it comes to Nintendo, but we have a great amount of communication and trust through the ranks as well.  All staff at N-Sider are part of the family, regardless if they work here now or long ago.</p>

2) To join the N-Sider team, you have to really want it.  Honestly, weve had some staff members before who really wanted to be on at first, but their interest waned, and as a result so did their contribution.  If you really think you have what it takes, both in skill and interest, you should not hesitate to give us a shout.


<hr><b>
Is Mafia Really coming to GC? I've heard many rumor... But the Mafia site doesn't say anything about it.. Can you guys call and confirm maby?
</b><br>
<i>-zanderdrake</i>

<p><b>Jason:</b> I personally spoke with a staff member from the Mafia team who told me it was coming to Cube.  However, Mafia has been getting little coverage at all these days be it for the PC or console versions.  Not really sure whats going on over at Illusion Softworks, but perhaps its time to find out.  With any luck we can get back to you soon with more information.

<hr><b>
I was wondering why it is that game publishers (read Nintendo) don't
produce games on-demand. This would fix several problems people
have now.<br>
1. No excuse for emulation.<br>
2. People can play those old games, in prime condition.<br>
3. Okay, maybe it's just those two...<br>
It doesn't seem like it would be that hard, book publishers are
starting to do on-demand publishing, why not game publishers? Or
even better, on-demand online publishing, there's a great way to use
the internet to make a profit.
</b><br>
<i>-The Calico Rabbit</i>

<p><b>Dean:</b> Its simply a matter of cost, or at least it seems to be. Nintendo is a
company who releases 'classic' games as packages (See: super mario
allstars), and to produce a small amount of oldskool games (like hogans
alley, or a more rare game like Back to the Future) would be costworthy. Not
only are they not creating blank carts anymore, they aren't making the
peripherals for the NES, or anything along those lines anymore. They'd
replace your carts so they MAY produce them that way, but not because you'd
request it.  It adds a feeling of owning a classic rarity too, how would you
feel if you owned a baseball card that was printed long ago, then they
printed an exact replica last week, its worth, would be nothing!

<p><b>James:</b> I think that games like Animal Crossing are starting to address this issue.  Nintendo is finding ways of distributing older games that are out of circulation.  Animal Crossing is an innovative way of distributing old games, in my opinion.  But also, Nintendo is distributing older games via the E-Reader and even the GBA (via remakes such as Super Mario Advance).  I hope Nintendo continues this trend with games in the future; it's great to see old games still getting a look in.

<hr><b>
I recall in an interview long ago when Mr. Miyamoto stated that Mario's water tank was not the only thing Mario could strap on his back but thus fare I have not seen nor read anything about another contraption that Mario can use. Was Miyamoto referring to the different nozzles that can be attached to the gun or is there a secret tool that lies deep within the game?
</b><br>
<i>-Jason</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> I'd really have to see the interview first. There are a lot of times where there's some translation confusion. If you get two interviews where he states the same thing under a different lights, it may be translated differently.

<p><b>James:</b> From what I know of the game, I suspect that Mr. Miyamoto was referring to different nozzles.  Early on, nobody seemed to be considering the idea that Fludd could be used in more ways that simply shooting water forwards.  My <A
href="http://n-sider.com/index_content.php?page=features/sunbaking.htm">Sun
Baking</A> features shed a little light on some of these concepts.  In particular, the <A
href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=features/sunbaking2.htm">second
feature</A> was pretty dead-on accurate in some ways.  I recommend re-reading it to see some of the early predictions.

<p><b>Jason:</b> I believe in that interview he merely stated that there would be more than the water canon for Mario to use.  As far as we are aware, there are no other devices that Mario can fasten to himself in <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>.  There are, however, many different nozzles that Mario can use for his backpack.  I Hope that helps.

<hr><b>
I like the new lay-out; it is pretty tight, not bad at all.  Mario Sunshine
is due out in the states next week and on a lot of message boards people
are already concerned about it's debut in Japan and how it didn't sell a
million copies in a few short weeks.  I guess this really isn't a question
directly but I was wondering your view on this.  I mean personally I could
care less how it is selling in Japan because it really has no effect on me
at all.  I am still going to buy the damn game as should all of you
reading this.  But to me I think it is selling just fine, a little shy of
half a million is no failure at all.  Also what people need to realize is
that Mario will sell a million once it reaches the States and Europe.  It
seems to me that Nintendo is bigger over seas then it is in it's home
country.  Oh well, I have rambled enough about this, enjoy Mario when you
get it.  I know I will!
</b><br>
<i>-Joseph</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> There's something to be said for the time of it's release. I would imagine that if it were sold during the holiday season, it would easily sell more in Japan. Also remember that it took SSBM roughly a month before it sold over 1 million copies. Nintendo sent out a press release before that, but it was only for the number shipped. The selling numbers from Dengeki and Famitsu didn't show the sales till a bit later.

<p><b>Dean:</b> Mario Sunshine sold 500 000 copies in 5 days, and its kept selling great
numbers, it'll hit a million easily once it launches in the US. and besides,
the game rocks, who cares what it sells, everyone else is missing out.

<p><b>James:</b> I think people get too wrapped up in sales figures.  Granted, Super Mario Sunshine didn't perform as well as many had expected, though the expectations for a new Mario game are always pretty astronomical.  However, the game still sold well by any measure.</p>

Also, I think some people are forgetting what Mario games are all about; they're overanalyzing this game.  I read comments on the Internet recently, which were along the lines of "It doesn't have Luigi/it has a silly title/it has a stupid water pack thingy and therefore it sucks".  These comments obviously came from someone who hasn't yet touched the game.  I think your comments are right on; just go and enjoy the game and don't get too preoccupied with sales figures.

<p><b>Jason:</b> I know, many people have been mixed on how Mario is faring in the land of the rising sun.  The thing that we all need to remember is that Mario isnt usually the type of game that fizzles out after a couple of weeks and drops off the charts into oblivion.  Super Mario Sunshine will more than likely end up selling fairly well for a long time to come.  This is actually what Nintendo has always believed in.  Create a game that is so good, that people will just keep buying it (Animal Forest in Japan had the same effect).  As the months and years go by, Mario will sell his decent amount.

<hr><b>
1. When will the black GBA come to the US?<br>
2. What's this news I hear from EGM (Electronic Gaming Monthly) of a back-lit
GBA release?
</b><br>
<i>-G</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> 1) Heh, funny you should ask. When we were at E3, Jeton had one and we were all wondering how he snagged, then he told us it was european (well, he <i>is</i> from Sweden). Anyway, you might be able to find a place to buy one in europe, as GBA's have no region block-outs to worry about. That might be a bit pricey for being the only kid on your block with a black GBA though, heh. Also, I have no idea if they're planning a release for one in North America.

2) You may be thinking of the <a href="http://www.tritonlabs.com/">Afterburner</a>, a third party mod for the GBA that installs a backlit screen into the handheld. I shouldn't need to remind anyone that doing this yourself can be pretty damaging if you don't know what you're doing. Although there are places out there that I believe will install them for you I believe.

<p><b>Mark:</b> Oh my god! Something is out in Australia that isnt out in USA, nicely done.  Weve had the jet black GBA for a good few months now.</p>

As for the back-lit GBA, dont count on an official one from Nintendo.  Theyve always stated that theyd rather have no back light for battery power, so unless theyve come up with a way to have the same battery life from the same batteries and all with back-lit screen, you can just forget about Nintendo officially doing one.  Afterburner, however, is something completely different, and if you really want a light for GBA, is probably the best way to go.

<p><b>Dean:</b> Nintendo is planning on  releasing the GBA 1.1 in Japan, which would promote
a brighter more vibrant screen w/ contrast controlls, but no word on a US
Release yet.

<hr><b>
Maybe you aren't the one I should be asking this to but I'm gonna ask it anyway. Why aren't there that many GameCube games at Blockbuster? I dunno if it's just the Blockbusters in NY, but there aren't many games available for rent. For ex:</p>

1) Bomberman, I dunno how good it is, I dont think it's worth a buy but I dont know.<br>
2) Beach Spikers, recently released but not planned to hit Blockbuster shelves!<br>
3) Dark Summit, heard in a review it's worth a rent.<br>
4) F1 Racing 2003, it seems like a fast pace racing game!<br>
5) Red Card Soccer, I've seen a preview with Blitz 20-03 and it looks good.<br>
6) Sega Soccer Slam, Seem like a kick-ass game but again not sure.<br>
7) Tetris World, I just wanna try Tetris on the 'Cube.<br>
8) ZooCube, seems like fun and I'd like to try for a week for $5</p>

Now that's 8 games I'd definitly rent and possibly buy, however it's probably not gonna happen. So before I send a complaint to Blockbuster I'd like to see if you have an anwser or comment for me. Thanks for listening and I really like the new website!!!
</b><br>
<i>-TheLegend2099</i>

<p><b>Mark:</b> 1) Try Glens review of Bomberman Generation right <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/bombermangeneration.htm">here</a>.</p>

As far as availability goes, do you have to go to Blockbuster?  Im sure you could find another rental store.if not, then just average out all the reviews you read online and print.

<p><b>Dean:</b> Believe it or not, there are some games that retailers like blockbuster,
rogers, or jumbo video cannot rent out! Its a publisher's thing, basically
you have to buy it or else. In canada stores do get around it though, My
local blockbuster has many games for rent, and places like 'microplay'
aren't constrained to the publisher's wishes, they can rent just about
anything.  It all comes down to location and allocation by the 'main'
warehouse of blockbuster or wherever you rent from.

<hr><b>
One quick question, does Time Splitters 2 control like Halo? Where one control stick moves the legs and the other the gun. I thought this is much easier than PD. I know you are going to say that is how PC FPS' are done but Halo is the only game with that type of control I have played.
</b><br>
<i>-hamby</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> The controls for the E3 demo I played used the C-Stick to look around and the Control Stick to move. I used to use an opposite control scheme in PD on a regular basis. Made for much faster and accurate shooting (for those of us that despise auto-aim, heh).

<p><b>Jason:</b> Yes, it does.  If you like that type of control and would love to give it a shot in another GameCube game, I suggest you play James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire.  This game can utilize dual analog sticks as well.  We are all hoping that Timesplitters 2 comes with an extensive amount of control options though to make it an easy play for everyone.




<hr><b>
Good to see you're back in business. You always were one of my favourite Nintendo sites. Anyhoo, I was wondering if you could tell me anything about Ubi Soft's new game, Project BG&E. It was playable at E3, but I havn't seen any impressions or information on it at all, for any system. I know it's by the guy who did Rayman, and I know its very big, but that's about it. Anything new on it would be very welcome. Thank you for your time.
</b><br>
<i>-Mr. Bloober</i>

<p><b>Patrick:</b> Michel Ancel's new project is a hugely ambitious one, and you can bet on it receiving a lot of coverage when more info breaks. As of right now, there's really not much to say. Ancel - who's been called the European Miyamoto - envisions Beyond Good and Evil to be the first game to feature a <i>complete</i> world and give players the feeling they're a character that can singlehandedly change the fate of the world. A bit ambitious if you ask me, but maybe that's just a healthy characteristic for a Miyamoto-like design-guru.

<hr><b>
What do you all think (honestly) of the new v3?
</b><br>
<i>-Tennyson</i>

<p><b>Dean:</b> It's been a long journey, we initally had a 'staff contest' to see who's
design would be ultimately used, the one that won (mine) -- wasn't used! But
that's okay, at first a lot of the staff had different opinions, but we've
all grown to love the new look. I personally, am upset of the lack of the
traditional 'blues' that n-sider is known for, other than that the site is
great! James (the designer) and I are working on an article for you guys
which will track the progress from when we started, to when we finished.
Expect that sometime in September.

<p><b>Brenden:</b> There is a reason why we didn't use Dean's design in the voting though. The main purpose of the planned relaunch was a re-focusing. We were growing fairly tired with the problem that the announcement of "Mary Kate & Ashley's Other Lame Game is coming out!" had the same importance as something like "Fanboy Confessions", on the front page. We wanted our features to stand out, that's why you have the N-Ticker to use. You'll notice that the N-Ticker has also allowed us to post even more news than we were before, but it leaves our great features open for the main page. As for the design aspect of it? I love it! For the longest time, I wasn't too keen on the odd resolution of the page, because it left a blank spot, but we cleared it all up.

<p><b>Mark:</b> Honestly, I love the new look.  The little things like avatars, the handle, and the peering eyes (okay that one was not so little) really do it for me.  Also, the theme of using the GCs buttons all over the sites look.

<p><b>James:</b> I'm pretty happy with the way v3 turned out.  It didn't quite fulfil every aspect of my original design brief, but I think it came darn close.  I'm also really happy to see that reaction to the site has been so positive.

<p><b>Patrick:</b> I think it kicks all kinds of ass that isn't even accounted for yet. Especially the artwork by our much-beloved artist David. I now have a David-shrine to honor him for my awesome Lakitu avatar.

<p><b>Jason:</b> I love it.  Dont you?

<hr><b>
First of all, I love the new design. I love the site more than ever. Good job guys.<br>
Now, few months ago you had a rumor section. I loved it. What has happened? Is there a chance it will be back?<br>
Rumors are the most interesting news in the videogames industry. I'll be more than glad to read more rumors.

</b><br>
<i>-Mattan</i>

<p><b>Dean:</b> You're thinking of 'The Buzz' -- thats a semi-regular feature on N-Sider, we
do one or two every quarter, you should expect to see one in the near
future. We really only do them when we have a lot of 'tidbits' that may or
may not be true. (but most of the time they are!)

<hr><b>
Hi guys, great new site. Keep up the latest news section.<br>
Just wondering, how are the actual sales figures of Eternal Darkness going. I cannot find any figures anywhere on the net. Is there a web site that specializes in releasing actual sales figures of all games released. Perhaps your site could start a section which details results of all 'Cube titles sold and figures to show how well that game is selling. The only one we seem to hear about is Mario Sunshine.
</b><br>
<i>-Peter Morton</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> Someone sent me <a href="http://boards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=26459933&replies=2">this</a> link from the IGN Trial Boards. It's got a top 500 list of games and their sales for the period ending in July. Eternal Darkness is listed, but there's no source on it, so take it as you like.

<hr><b>
Is it likely that Spring will be as lackluster as this year's, what with all the huge games coming out all at once?
</b><br>
<i>-Tomspug</i>

<p><b>Patrick:</b> What do you mean? Are you calling Zelda lackluster? I bet that once our elfish hero gets in the spotlight again and you'll be able to play his latest game, it will grip you and won't let go until it's time for you to begin your wintersleep.

<p><b>Brenden:</b> Patrick's right, we should be happy to be getting Zelda around that time (February we're hoping). You know why? That time of the year is notoriously <i>dead</i> for video games. It's just not a big buying season (for the average consumer... not the average gamer).

<hr><b>
Oy my Gord, it's a relaunch! I must say, it truly is a
thing of beauty. Wonderful art direction. And the
re-focusing of the site seems a great idea. But enough
about that... I should probably ask a question. Like,
"When are the forums coming back," or "Is Cory going
to throw seeds at me." Or, howabout this: What makes
N-Sider different then say, Gamefaqs? After all, your
goals seem similar now...the in-depth treatment.</p>

One last thing...whomever created those banner
pictures (Mario, Zelda, Fox) should be crowned King of
the Universe.
</b><br>
<i>Dr. Xoa</i>

<p><b>Brenden:</b> Heh, nice try Axord. Anyway, concerning the GameFaqs question, maybe it doesn't make us that different... but then again, you can say the same about any gaming site can't you? It really all depends on who's content you prefer reading. Myself? I visit a bunch of sites, there's always good stuff out there. Besides, it's been sometime since I've seen an editorial over at GameFaqs, heh.</p>

And no, Cory will not throw seeds at you. He may drink your blood though.

<p><b>Dean:</b> Axord, your names will never fool us. Feel the wrath of the Almighty
Space Mongoose!  -- Also, David Hellman, is as of right now 'king' of the
universe, he's one of our main artists on the universe project. How's that
for irony? heh.

<p><b>Mark:</b> There you go David, something wants to bow down to your artistic talents!

<p><b>James:</b> I can't comment on GameFaqs, because I don't visit the site.  I can only say that in-depth stuff has always been N-Sider's focus.  The only difference now is that we've "refocused" to keep ourselves on track. ^_^

<p><b>Jason:</b> Good question.  Were different from GameFAQs in that we cover the details in games but still do coverage of the industry as well.  Were not only about listing the details in the games, but rather we like to go in-depth with the entire Nintendo universe.

<p><b>David:</b> Thanks, Doctor Xoa.
