<p>Konami of America has released <i>YuGiOh! 7 Trials to Glory: World Championship Tournament 2005</i> for the Game Boy Advance. Information and screens can be found on the official <a href="http://www.konami.com/gs/worldchampionship2005/">website</a>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <i>Winnie The Pooh: Rumbly Tumbly</i> is now available for the Nintendo GameCube.  The official <a href="http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=1892">website</a> contains additional info and screens.</p>

<p>Bandai said it will release <i>SD Gundam G Generation DS</i> for Nintendo DS in Japan later this year. There is currently no word on a North American release.  Screens of the title can be seen <a href="http://www.the-magicbox.com/0502/game050216d.shtml">here</a>, courtesy of The-MagicBox.</p>

<p>According to the NPD Group, <i>Resident Evil 4</i> for the Nintendo GameCube was the best selling game during the month of January.  The title has sold over 300,000 units during its initial month of sale. Resident Evil 4 is one of the highest rated games of this generation featuring an average review ranking of 96 percent on <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/535840.asp">GameRankings.com</a>.</p>

<p>NPD has also noted that there was a 41 percent rise in handheld software sales during the month of January due to strong sales on the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>I came upon an amusing editorial at <a href="http://gc.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=4238">GCAdvanced.com</a> that asks Nintendo fans to "Keep the Faith".  The piece contemplates how fans have blindly demanded perfection while avoiding the reality of Nintendo's continued success and its continued creation of quality entertainment.</p>
