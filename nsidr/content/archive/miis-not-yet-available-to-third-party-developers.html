Wondering why only a handful of Wii titles&mdash;and only Nintendo titles, at that&mdash;don't use your Miis?  Next Generation seems to have found out why.<br />
<br />
A recent story singles out the Mii Channel as an example of the power of user-generated content, but notes the weaknesses as well.  On top of the limitations of the 100-Mii limit and the potential difficulty of integrating Miis into games with varying graphical style, Next Generation also heard from Electronic Arts producer Eric Chartrand, who says Nintendo <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4834&Itemid=2&limit=1&limitstart=1">has not yet released tools</a> to give third parties access to the characters.<br />
<br />
Delaying (or never intending to make?) such a move has the potential to hamper the ubiquity of the Mii across the Wii platform.  Of course, it should be noted that not even all Nintendo's own titles support Mii yet either, with the feature being more of an exception rather than a rule.  Hopefully, this will change in the future.
