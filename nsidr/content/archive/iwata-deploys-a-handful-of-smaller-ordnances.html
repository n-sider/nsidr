Nintendo Co. president Satoru Iwata gave this morning, "Discovering New Development Opportunities", at the Game Developer's Conference in San Francisco.  Though the audience for these talks is <i>presumably</i> game developers who only care about what Nintendo's doing inasmuch as it gives them either opportunities for Nintendo-platform content or puts the fear of competing against Nintendo's latest into them, Iwata has as of late been using his podium to throw out little announcements here and there.<br />

To wit, once he finished the portion of his speech wherein he spent a lot of time both tooting Nintendo's horn in what has come to be a typical fashion (including the revelation that <i>Wii Fit</i> sales are approaching PlayStation 3 install base) and praising Shigeru Miyamoto, Iwata spilled the following beans:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Rock & Roll Climber</i>, having been rumored for some time, was finally shown for WiiWare.  This game uses both the Wii Remote and <i>Wii Fit</i>'s Balance Board to simulate climbing a mountain.  It has nothing to do with <i>Ice Climbers</i>.</li>
  <li>A new release of the Wii system software (4.0) is now available to address the problem of rapidly-filling Wii storage making it inconvenient to buy Virtual Console and WiiWare titles.  There's now a secondary 20-page channels menu, accessible via a little SD icon in the corner, that will load whichever channel you choose from SD to internal memory before launching it&mdash;a process that takes only a handful of seconds.  Saves, however, must all still reside in internal memory.  SDHC is also now supported, up to 32 GB.</li>
  <li>A whole bunch of <i>Final Fantasy</i>, including <i>I</i> and <i>IV</i> on Virtual Console (Japan gets all the others through <i>VI</i> as well) as well as <i>IV: The Years After</i> and <i>Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord</i> for WiiWare.  From Nintendo, <i>Moving Memo</i> and <i>WarioWare Snapped!</i>&mdash;previously available in Japan&mdash;coming to DSiWare here.</li>
  <li>The Virtual Console has a new section&mdash;Virtual Console Arcade&mdash;which will presumably contain arcade-perfect emulations of arcade titles.  (Hoping for <i>Bubble Bobble</i>, personally.  No port does it justice.)</li>
  <li>Finally, just as we thought we were done, the sheer power of the Internet hype train seems to have willed an appropriately-themed Zelda title into existence: <i>The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</i>.  Looking similar to <i>Phantom Hourglass</i> but featuring Link as a conductor of his own train instead of a steamship, this title looks really promising&mdash;and never fear, it's not looking like a spinoff.</li>
  </ul><br />
Nintendo's got <i>Excitebots</i> and <i>Punch-Out!!</i> playable on the floor.  The Game Developer's Conference runs through the 27th.
