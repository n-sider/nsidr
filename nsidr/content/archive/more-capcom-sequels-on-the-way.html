<p>Capcom has registered the domains for <b>onimusha4.com</b>, <b>residentevil5.com</b>, and <b>viewtifuljoe3.com<b> out of their Sunnyvale, California office. 

<p>This does not confirm that sequels to these games are currently in the works; however it is always nice to see that Capcom is actively securing domain names and trademarks for titles that may be coming at some point in the near future!

<p>More as it comes!
