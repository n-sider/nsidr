<p>Via <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/">4 color rebellion</a> comes some very positive <a href="http://www.sickleandhammer.net/blog/comments.php?y=05&m=10&entry=entry051020-221909">hands-on impressions</a> with the recent Japanese Nintendo DS release <i>Super Princess Peach</i>.</p>

<p>In the impressions, Mitch, the blog's author, compliments the game's length as well as "fluid and responsive" controls and physics.  The title is also compared very favorably to past Super Mario platformers.</p>

<p>No release date has yet been set for the title outside Japan.</p>
