<a href="http://www.briefing.com/">Briefing.com</a> (subscription required) is reporting that Nintendo has been exceeding their original Wii production estimates and is now predicting to have an estimated 2 million units at launch, twice the quantity of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2453">initial estimate</a>.<br />
<br />
If by some chance you're unlucky enough not to have a Wii preordered, Nintendo is predicting to have at least 7 million and upwards to 9 million Wii's available by the end of the 4th quarter.
