<p>The DFC Intelligence recently issued a report analyzing and predicting next-generation console sales.  They predict the PlayStation 3s best-case scenario in North America will give it a 49 percent share of the market by 2010. This scenario would give Xbox 360 26 percent of the market and Nintendo Revolution 25 percent, according to NextGen.biz.</p>

<p>The best-case scenario for Xbox 360 on the other hand would have the console with 40 percent of the market.  Meanwhile, the best-case scenario for Revolution would see it holding 35 percent of the market.</p>

<p>"The big point is that Sony is definitely the favorite,"  said DFC analyst David Cole. "Even in a worse case scenario they are at nearly 50 percent. But it is hard to see them maintaining the market share they have with PlayStation 2, which broke all the rules in terms of how successful a hardware platform can be."</p>
