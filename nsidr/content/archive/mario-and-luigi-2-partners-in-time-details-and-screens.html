New details regarding <i>Mario and Luigi 2: Partners in Time</i> for Nintendo DS have emerged, including several new <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/screens/574/">screenshots</a>.
<br>
<br>
The title will feature <i>Mario RPG</i>-style mechanics (such as dodging or inflicting attacks with well-timed button presses), and will utilize the DS touch screen in unique ways -- players can locate lost team-mates and execute combo moves during battle, for instance.
<br>
<br>
<i>Mario and Luigi 2</i> is scheduled for a late-November release in the US.
