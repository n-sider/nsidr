A report by Reuters notes that shares of Nintendo Co., Ltd. <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?view=CN&storyID=2006-11-15T084248Z_01_T266787_RTRIDST_0_LEISURE-JAPAN-NINTENDO-UPDATE-1.XML&rpc=66&type=qcna">hit a record high</a> yesterday of 26,770 yen, closing the day out at 26,750 yen.<br />
<br />
Behind this record share price is the news that Nintendo will be shipping nearly 400,000 Wii consoles for the Japanese launch on December 2, as well as 1.5 million of the Nintendo DS throughout December.  Last month, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2496">raised its forecasts</a> for the DS, saying they expected to ship 20 million units by the close of their financial year in March, up 18% from their previous forecast.<br />
<br />
Wii launches in North America this coming Sunday, November 19.  Nintendo has said it will have <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2453">one million units</a> for that launch, and expects to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2504">move four million</a> before the year is out.
