Electronic Arts has released a trailer for its mystery Steven Spielberg Wii game.  The game previously codenamed "PQRS" is now tentatively titled <i>Blocks</i>.  The game will feature single player, co-op, and versus modes for players to interact with, build and destroy a variety of structures made of blocks.  Think Wii's version of Sony's Little Big Planet...except, you know, with blocks.<br />
