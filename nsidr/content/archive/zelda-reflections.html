<H3>Reflections On The Wind Waker</H3>

It must have been the best feeling in the world.  One could almost hear the faint sound of several dozen computers humming in unison, speckling desks around the office cubicles.  The vision might even invoke feelings of relaxation with the hypnotizing sounds of keyboard key presses and the glow of fluorescent light.  But you would be deceived.  For Nintendo director Eiji Aonuma and his orchestrated team saw no rest on the weeks leading up to the Japanese release of The Wind Waker.  They were riding on a promise Shigeru Miyamoto made more than a year prior, to deliver the next in the Zelda line before 2002 comes to a close.  A promise that would prove to be a test of strength for everyone involved 

<p>In a way, the team must have felt like Link at times.  Emotions like despair and determination flash through the minds of the staff toiling away at the unfinished code.  And for a fleeting moment, the mission may have even looked to be impossible.  But what would our great hero do in a situation of hopelessness?  The belt was tightened a notch or two and reinforcements came to see that this game left on time and in record quality.  In the end, the promise was kept, and Zelda was released in Nintendos homeland right on schedule.  And now having had three months to savor the entire experience with the North American launch, I can say without blinking that every bead of sweat that went into the development was worth it. 

<p>But for reasons unknown, this world of The Wind Waker seems to be aging like a fine wine.  Upon release, Zelda had me entranced.  Every moment that I was not playing the game was a moment that I was thinking about it.  Yet that sort of obsession seemed to have come at a price.   When playing the game, I was never really able to take the time to sit back and appreciate its majestic qualities.  And although I enjoyed my time with the game immensely, the game had high expectations to live up to, and many dreams to fulfill.  That has all changed with time though.  Now the game comes across as a beautiful piece of work in many different ways.  Some ways you may not have even taken the time to appreciate, as I had done.  So let us discuss what makes Zelda quite possibly the greatest game Nintendo has ever created.

<p>First and foremost, Nintendo accomplished something with this game that seems to still be their one untouchable area of expertise.  They have made yet another game that is a joy to play within seconds of touching the controller.  The degree of precision given to all of Links actions makes you feel as though he truly is an avatar for your inner adventurer.  And as such, the game grabs a hold of you, and takes you through a journey that you never want to end.  

<p>Yet not all this interest is a result of the control mechanics.  Much of the pleasure to be found in the game is a result of the action/reaction taking place.  Having the boats sails catch that first gust of wind, or watching Links hat dance in the breeze are examples of how beautiful this game can be without even involving technical specifications.  In many cases, watching the sun set at night is a sight to behold.  Clouds effortlessly drift across an open sky with tiny sparkling stars glistening as if there really are worlds out there in the great void.  Interacting with objects littered throughout New Hyrule is equally compelling.  Cutting fields of grass and watching the blades flutter in the wind for a moment feels divine.  Even cutting down the random sign has a curious amount of appeal.

<p>The most obvious thing I can speak of is the aesthetic value in the game.  The richness of the visuals is so great sometimes that I am actually at a loss for words at times.  The windmill on Windfall Island, the thunder showers, and the gigantic Tower of the Gods are all beautifully rendered pieces of environment.  But what really puts even the environments to shame is the characters themselves.  Link has an incredibly degree of fluidity that I think many overlook.  One of his feet can be on a bench, while the other is on the ground.  All the while his head is turned to one side while his eyes follow something just as ours would.  And although it sounds so trivial in words, Links emotions just cant be praised enough.  When he watches someone as you walk by them, you can really see a strong
