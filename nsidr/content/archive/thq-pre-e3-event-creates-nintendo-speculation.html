<p>IGN.com recently had the opportunity to go hands-on with the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Nintendo Revolution</a> controller at a THQ pre-E3 press event in Hollywood, CA.  The occasion was held in a posh mansion to showcase the company's latest game titles.  Editor Matt Casamassina writes in his <a href="http://blogs.ign.com/Matt-IGN/2006/04/18/12726/#comments">blog</a> that he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement before gaining access.  This means that there is likely to be very little game-related news to come out of the event (although its been rumored that SpongeBob was one of the Revolution titles demonstrated).  That said, Casamassina was permitted to snap a few photos including his hands-on opportunity with a prototype of the Revolution controller.</p>

<p>THQ has been very vocal about its support for the Nintendo Revolution console.  During a year-end press event in September 2005, THQ CEO Brian Farrell confirmed the company's commitment.  "Nintendo has long been a trailblazer, and this controller design reinforces that reputation," he said.  "We enthusiastically support Nintendo's next console because we believe their approach of continual innovation is very much in line with our own strategy of creating unique and innovative games for the next generation of hardware."</p>
