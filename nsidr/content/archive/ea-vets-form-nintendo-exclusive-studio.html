A group of veterans of the EA Canada studios responsible for FIFA, Need for Speed, and James Bond titles have announced the <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=24241">formation of a new studio</a>, Jet Black Studios, that will focus solely on Wii and Nintendo DS development.<br />
<br />
Co-founder and CEO Roger Freddi seems especially enthused about both platforms' online capabilities, saying "Both the Nintendo DS and the Wii's Wi-Fi capabilities provide an advanced medium for Jet Black to bring already popular franchises to an even broader worldwide audience."<br />
<br />
Jet Black is currently working with business management firm Flashman Studios, who has worked on licensed projects for Disney/Pixar, Ignition, WB, and SOE.
