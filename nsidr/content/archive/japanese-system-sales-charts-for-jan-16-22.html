<P>The weekly system sales charts from Japan come to us via <a href="http://www.the-magicbox.com">The Magicbox.</a></P>
<P>   1. Nintendo DS - 64,515 [210,178] units<br>
   2. PSP - 38,271 [228,714] units<br>
   3. PlayStation 2 - 26,135 [146,097] units<br>
   4. GameBoy Advance SP - 7,912 [35,337] units<br>
   5. GameBoy Micro - 4,653 [22,812] units<br>
   6. GameCube - 4,490 [23,378] units<br>
   7. Xbox 360 - 3,616 [17,200] units<br>
   8. GameBoy Advance - 236 [1,033] units<br>
   9. Xbox - 83 [358] units </P>
<P>Aside from the trivial fact that the DS is now outselling the PSP again, after two weeks of diminished stock and smaller sales, is the absolutely <i>stellar</i> week that Xbox 360 had.   Nintendo sold three times as many DS systems this week as Microsoft has 360s this entire year.  Nice job, Microsoft, and continued success wished to you in the Land of the Rising Sun!</P>
