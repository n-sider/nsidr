<p>We've opted to avoid the issue up until this point and instead sit back and let the rest of the 'net get up in a frenzy about it.  With that said, we've still no intention of choosing a side, especially at a time when we still don't even know what the "Revolution" is.  Perhaps there's a reason, besides cost, for why Nintendo has chosen to snub it.  Who knows... However, so that we don't fall behind in regards to news, here's a recap of where things stand.</p>

<p>We came out of this past May 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo with both Microsoft and Sony claiming the future is in high-definition television.  A customer service email posted on a message board several weeks ago noted that Nintendo currently has no plans to support HD with its Revolution console.  Shortly afterwards, IGNCube decided to ask Nintendo directly and upon receiving a similar answer, wrote a lengthy <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/624/624200p1.html">editorial</a> on the matter.  Since then the topic has exploded.  IGN has tried to rally its HD-approving troops to <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/625/625423p1.html">write</a> letters to Nintendo.  Meanwhile there have been <a href="http://www.nintendo-resolution.com/">several</a> <a href="http://www.1080up.org/">websites</a> established with the same idea in mind.  Oh, and of course there have been several <a href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/editorials.cfm?action=profile&id=164">editorials</a> too.</p>

<p>So that's where we stand.  If you're itching to jump into the fray and voice your opinion, there's already multiple heated <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=2660">discussions</a> in the N-Forums.</p>
