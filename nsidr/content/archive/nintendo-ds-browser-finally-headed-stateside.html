IGN has picked up <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/771/771323p1.html">word from GDC</a> that Nintendo finally plans to bring the Nintendo DS Browser stateside.<br />
<br />
The browser, developed by Opera Software, includes a RAM expansion pack that goes into Slot 2 on the DS (which is also where things like the Rumble Pak and Game Boy Advance games go).  Provided users are near a Wi-Fi connection, the browser will let them visit World Wide Web sites, although the experience is said by many to be less than enjoyable due to poor performance and a clunky user interface.<br />
<br />
The browser will release June 4.  Price details were not announced, nor whether Nintendo intends to sell it via traditional retail channels or via its online store, like it did for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=880"><i>Electroplankton</i></a>.
