Two new games have found their way onto the European Virtual Console, including the original debut of everyone's favorite Blue Bomber.<br />
<br />
Europe's new games are as follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Mega Man (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li>China Warrior (TurboGrafx-16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
These two games bring the total number of VC titles in Europe up to 103. North America will, as always, see its new releases on Monday.
