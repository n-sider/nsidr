<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-06-15-megamanbattlenetwork6.jpg" align="right" border="0" alt="Mega Man Battle Network 6 for Nintendo Game Boy Advance">Mega Man Battle Network 6 <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=160727">Falzar</a> and <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=160728">Gregar</a> are now available on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance for $29.99 each.  More info can be found at the game's official <a href="http://www.capcom.com/xpml/game.xpml?gameid=850049">website</a>.</p>

<p>This new edition is a continuation of the series following the journeys of Lan and Mega Man.  A new "Cross System" allows Mega Man to utilize the special power of allies in battle. While a Cross is equipped, Mega Man can also Beast Out, combining the forces of these two systems to maximize the power of the Crosses even further.</p>

<a href="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/712/712597p1.html">IGN</a> says (5.5/10),<br>
"So as the Game Boy Advance continues to slow down in both the quantity and quality of games, is Mega Man Battle Network 6 a worthy choice even after all these years? The truth is, not really. While the gameplay may have some of the most entertaining battles thus far in the series, the whole formula is running very, very dry. If this is your first Battle Network game, then by all means enjoy the trip. If you're an avid fan of the series and are wondering if it holds up against the others, yes it still does. When looking at the entirety of the franchise, however, and the fact that we are on Battle Network #12 and #13 (taking into account all the multiple versions and spin-off titles) it becomes all-too apparent that this series has nothing left to do, and no story left to tell."
