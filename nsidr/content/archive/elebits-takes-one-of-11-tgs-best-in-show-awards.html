<p>Coming out of the recently-held Tokyo Game Show, Konami's Wii launch title <cite>Elebits</cite> has received <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/09/24/tgs-best-in-show-award-microsoft-sony-nintendo-all-win/">one of eleven awards</a> given by a committee for "best games showing particular promise", after tallying the votes of show attendees.</p>

<p>The only other Nintendo-platform title recieving the award is Capcom's <cite>Gyakuten Saiban 4</cite>, better known to English-speakers as <cite>Phoenix Wright 4</cite>.  Nintendo does not have a presence at the show, as is typical for them&mdash;this year especially, the company is concentrating on its own Wii press events such as the Wii Preview events held two weeks ago.</p>
