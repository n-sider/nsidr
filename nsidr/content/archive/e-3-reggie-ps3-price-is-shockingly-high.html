<p>Kotaku.com bumped into <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of sales and marketing, yesterday at the Nintendo party.</p>

<p>They asked him his thoughts on Sony's recent price announcement for its PlayStation 3 console (PS3 with 20GB hard drive for $499 and 60GB hard drive for $599).  Fils-Aime replied oh-so-eloquently with a simple, "It's shockingly high."</p>
