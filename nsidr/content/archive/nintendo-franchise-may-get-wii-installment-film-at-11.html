Hidden deep within the foot-thick steel walls of Nintendo Europe's VIP club, Star Fox creator <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=454">Takaya Imamura</a> gave an interview where he <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/gb/wii/game/news/article.jsp?releaseId=20070125154649578007&articleId=20070125154649578007&sectionId=1006">reportedly hinted</a> that a Wii installment for the franchise is in the works.<br />
<br />
Games Radar, reporting on the interview, said Imamura was asked about a Wii entry in the series, to which he replied "I wonder how the adventure of Fox and friends is going to go next time?! I have come up with some idea in my mind but it is still just a small one. I will try my best so that I can deliver it to you some time!"<br />
<br />
If anything does get announced, we'll certainly let you know&mdash;it seems a pretty safe bet.
