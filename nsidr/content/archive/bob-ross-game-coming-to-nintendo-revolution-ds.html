<p><a href="http://www.bobross.com/news.cfm">Bob Ross Inc.</a> has partnered with independent developer <a href="http://agfrag.netfirms.com">AGFRAG Entertainment</a> to bring a title based on the late artist Bob Ross to Nintendo DS and Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed Revolution.  Bob Ross is known for his television show  The Joy of Painting.  The show began in 1982, lasting for 11 years, and revolved around Ross' extraordinary talent of taking a white canvas, applying paint and turning it into a beautiful landscape. Watchers were encouraged to pick up a paint brush and move with him.  His popular phrase to those brave enough to try was, "We don't make mistakes -- we just have happy accidents."  Ross passed away in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross">1995</a>.</p>

<p>The Bob Ross game is said to utilize the unique hands-on inputs provided by the Nintendo DS and Nintendo Revolution consoles. Users will be able to learn how to paint like Bob Ross and also enjoy several "addictive and fun games" planned by the developer.  AGFRAG is currently searching for a publisher.</p>

<p>The developer is looking for further input from fans.  Joseph Hatcher, director of development, noted, "I want the community to share with us their favorite Bob Ross shows, painting techniques, and what they'd like to see in the NDS and Revolution games. We want to keep the brush going."  You can share your thoughts on AGFRAG's <a href="http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/bobrossgame/">message board</a>.</p>

<p>Hatcher also hopes the studio will be able to incorporate Ross' voice into the game.  "We have full rights to all of the transcripts, all of the audio archives, all of the paintings," he told <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1527820/20060404/index.jhtml?headlines=true">MTV.com</a>. "We like his mellow voice, and it will be very cool to allow fans to paint with him."</p>
