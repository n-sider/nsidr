<p>It's the last business day before the N-Sider Staff embark on their journey to Los Angeles; and what better way to celebrate the last day of the preceeding week, than to take a look back at the last day of E3 2005.</p>
<p>In today's excerpt, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-2005-a-retrospective/6">Mark Medina</a> gives us his perspective on the events of that day:</p>

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>Ahhh, the fateful last day. The day when you try to do all the  things you thought you'd have time for, like seeing other stands and  playing games you hadn't looked at the previous two days. I'd pretty  much seen and played everything I wanted to play, but this day was the  day I'd finally gotten around to trying Mario Strikers and man I wish  I'd gotten to it sooner. Ricardo and I were amazed with it when we  played it two-player (I won, for the record :P) and later Josh joined  us for some 4-player action and we managed to crash the game! That was  amusing.</p>
      <p>After the show I hung out with the crew at the hotel for some gaming  and whooped Brandon's ass at Street Fighter :P (apparently he'd wanted  to challenge me earlier but we couldn't because I was always going home  on the trains while there was still daylight!) and Ricardo's ass at  Mario Tennis :P. A bit of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! here, some other  games there, and day turned into night.</p>
    <p>As people started to get hungry Angel, Glen, Brandon and Jess  decided to go out for some dinner so I tagged along to get a ride to  the subway station. I said my goodbye's to Justin (who's also  experienced the joys of the Blue Line on his way to the hotel at the  beginning of E3), Ricardo, Dean, and Ben. The rest of us squeezed into  Angel's Honda and as I said my goodbye's to the four of them, the last  thing I heard as I closed the door was Angel saying &quot;Be Careful  Mark!!!!!&quot; as I walked to the subway, which leads nicely to my funny  transportation story of the day. It was the first time I'd ridden the  train home after sunset and I admit I was a little worried at what sort  of passengers I'd see on my way home. Luckily nothing scary happened on  the way and even though there weren't any cops I felt alright, must've  been just me being used to it. The funny part is that on each day I'd  organized for someone to pick me up and they'd always be there when I  got to the station so I never had to wait, except this day they came 20  minutes late and I had to hang around at the train station in Long  Beach waiting for my ride while some seedy looking guy was at the other  side of the station just loitering. It was quite a tense wait. All up,  it wasn't that scary commuting to and from Downtown L.A. to Long Beach  but it doesn't help when you hear a few horror stories that happen in  areas that you travel through each day!</p></td>
