<p>As we mentioned earlier, Opera and Nintendo have reached an agreement to release Opera's web browser for the Nintendo DS.  The software will be sold on a standard DS game card for 3,800 yen.  A RAM expansion card will also be included to be inserted into the Game Boy Advance port to allow easier webpage uploads.  After inserting the cartridge and using a wireless hotspot to connect your Nintendo DS to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service, users will have full access to the Internet through the handheld's two screens.</p>

<p>Users will be provided an on-screen keypad to allow "PDA-like functionality". The DS web browser is said to be built on the same core as the Opera desktop browser.</p>

<p>According to an Opera employee in the company forums, the browser will have two viewing modes available.  "Fit-to-width mode (similar to what mobile users are already familiar with their mobile phones using the Opera Mobile browser)," he describes.  "This mode will use <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/smallscreen/">Small Screen Rendering</a> to fit the page across both screens. Alternatively, there is a DS mode which displays an overall page view on the lower screen (where you may use the touch screen to navigate around a sort of "mini map") and read the text on the top screen in full-sized view."

<p>Finally, there is unconfirmed word that the browser will not support Java, Flash or PDF files.  A video of someone using the browser can be seen <a href="http://ghardhentai.hp.infoseek.co.jp/nintendo_wbs.avi">here</a>.</p>
