<p>European <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> buyers were quite the lucky bunch&mdash;Nintendo offered, in their territory, the option to buy the Lite <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2182">in an exclusive black color</a>.</p>

<p>However, news comes today that Nintendo intends to <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/lite/color/index.html">offer Jet Black in Japan</a> come September 2 of this year.  This marks the fifth color choice available in Nintendo's home country, supplementing Crystal White, Ice Blue, Enamel Navy, and Noble Pink (which is set to become available July 20).</p>
