Nintendo of Europe has decided to start dipping into the catalog of games never released in Europe for their own version of the Virtual Console service, resulting in a rather impressive week for that territory.  Today's releases are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels (NES; 600 Wii Points)</li>
  <li>Mario's Super Picross (SNES; 900 Wii Points)</li>
  <li>Neutopia II (Turbografx; 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
Both Lost Levels and Super Picross have never seen the light of day outside Japan (though Lost Levels made a remade appearance as part of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=108"><i>Super Mario All-Stars</i></a> for the SNES).  Nintendo of Europe is running an event they call the "Hanabi Festival" for this week and the two following weeks, and say VC fans can expect titles such as the North American releases of <i>Ninja Gaiden</i> and <i>Gradius III</i> as well as Japanese releases <i>JaJaMaru-Kun</i> and <i>Sin and Punishment</i>.
