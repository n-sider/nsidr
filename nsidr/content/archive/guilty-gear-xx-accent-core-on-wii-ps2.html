Publisher Aksys Games has announced that it is bringing the latest iteration of Arc System Works' Guilty Gear series, <i>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core</i>, to the Playstation 2 and Wii in North America. With the announcement came some new <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=3988&view=media">screenshots and concept art</a>. This marks the second time the franchise has appeared on a Nintendo console&mdash;the first being <i>Guilty Gear Dust Strikers</i> for the DS.<br />
<br />
The latest entry in the series will feature a reworked fighting system, new stages, and two new characters never seen outside of Japan. With the two new characters, A.B.A and Order-Sol, the roster reaches over 20 unique characters, as well as alternate EX versions for each character. The new Generations Mode allows players to set up matches between the old and new characters. <br />
<br />
The Wii version of Accent Core utilizes the Wii remote for a brand new control system using simple gestures, but for purists the option is there to use either a GameCube or Classic controller.<br />
<br />
Guilty Gear XX Accent Core will be released July 26, 2007 in Japan. A fall release is planned for North America.
