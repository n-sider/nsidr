Disney announced today that <i>Meteos: Disney Magic</i>, a sequel of sorts to Nintendo DS classic <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=994"><i>Meteos</i></a> is now available.<br />
<br />
Meteos: Disney Magic carries over the basic gameplay from its predecessor, where you arranged tiles within columns with the stylus in order to create horizontal or vertical matches of three or more, which would fire and launch blocks on top off the screen.  Disney Magic changes up that formula slightly by (at least in the lower difficulty levels) allowing the player to slide tiles in rows as well, as well as changing the way the DS is held to the sideways "book" format, increasing the playfield size.<br />
<br />
Of course, it wouldn't be Disney Magic without Disney themes, and Meteos: Disney Magic features nine of these.  MSRP is set at $29.99 and the game is on shelves now.
