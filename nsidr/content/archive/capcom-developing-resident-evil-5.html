Capcom revealed the development of <i>Resident Evil 5</i> in the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu. Although it will carry on the plot from Resident Evil 4, the game is said to follow the adventure of a unique character from the series' past and take place in a new visually-realistic desert environment.  The title has been announced for both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.  There is currently no mention of a Nintendo Revolution version.  Word on the street is that Nintendo has requested all publishers to refrain from Revolution software announcements until later this year, while other speculation claims Capcom has no intention of developing it for the uniquely-featured Revolution console.  More information will likely be disclosed at the upcoming Japanese Toyko Game Show.
