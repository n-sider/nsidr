Jumping on board the DS train is GungHo Online Entertainment, makers of PC MMO <i>Ragnarok Online</i> and parent group of Game Arts (of Lunar, Grandia, and GunGriffon fame).  GungHo issued a release indicating they are now licensed developers for the Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
Astute observers will at this time be looking suspiciously at this story, as they are aware that <i>Lunar: Dragon Song</i> was already released for Nintendo DS (and even published stateside by Ubisoft).  However, that title was actually done by Japan Art Media and published by Marvelous.<br />
<br />
Reporting on this announcement, Famitsu asked GungHo what game they were working on as a result of this announcement.  GungHo said an announcement would be coming soon, and also noted that they were not changing their multiplatform stance.
