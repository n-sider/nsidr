<p>According to PolygonMag, Nintendo has introduced a policy that will mandate general employees retire once they reach the age of 65.  Meanwhile, management positions will have a mandatory retirement age of 60.</p>

<p>The rising average age of the company's employees is said to be the reason for the decision. An unnamed Nintendo spokesperson said, "The average age of retirement is currently 62, so our policy will have little effect on most employees."</p>
