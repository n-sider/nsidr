Signature Devices subsidiary Graffiti Entertainment has announced that they are now publishers for Wii and Nintendo DS in North America.  Graffiti's current claim to fame is publishing the multiplatform <i>Crazy Frog Racer</i>, featuring (you guessed it) Crazy Frog.<br />

Kenneth Hurley, CEO of both Signature and Graffiti, was predictably thrilled.  "We are thrilled <i>[see? -M]</i> to have been selected as an official publisher for this leading hardware manufacturer," he said. "We have been getting fortified and are now ready to take advantage of the ever-increasing video game market, with U.S. sales of software, hardware and accessories amounting to over $12.5 billion in 2006."
