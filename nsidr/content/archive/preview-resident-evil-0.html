<H3>Resident Evil 0</H3><p>

Hot on the heels of Capcom's <i>Resident Evil</i> remake comes Capcom's next entry to the famous survival horror series. <i>Resident Evil 0</i> is the next all-new game in the series and though it was originally destined for the Nintendo 64, it has since been bumped up to the more powerful Nintendo GameCube.<p>

<b>Features</b>
<ul>
<li>A prequel to the highly impressive GameCube remake.
<li>Players now have the ability to control two character simultaneously; Rebecca Chambers and Billy Cohen.
<li>Uses the same unique FMV/real time graphics technology that made <i>Resident Evil</i> so visually stunning.
<li>Exclusive to Nintendo GameCube.
  </ul><p>

<i>Resident Evil 0</i> has gone through many changes over the last few years. Originally, the game was set to release on Nintendo 64. However, as game development progressed, Nintendo was already preparing for the launch of its next generation GameCube console. For a brief period, there were rumors that the game had been cancelled. However, Capcom soon revealed that not only was it developing a stunning remake to the original <i>Resident Evil</i>, but moreover, all future games in the series would be destined for the Nintendo GameCube. <i>Resident Evil</i> creator Shinji Mikami also used the announcement to reveal that <i>Resident Evil 0</i> was still very much on track.<p>

Even in the very early shots of the Nintendo 64 version, Capcom had already revealed the unique two character system used in the game. Many early screenshots showed both Billy and Rebecca in the same room, though early on, not a great deal was revealed about how this gameplay feature would actually work. Now that the game's demo has been released in Japan, we have a clearer idea of how the system will function.<p>

The "character zap feature" is a central part of the overall gameplay. And many of the game's puzzles will require you to intelligently utilize both characters. When it comes to manipulating both characters, you have several options. Primarily, you'll find that you never actually have direct control over the secondary character. Rather, the secondary character is always in the AI's hands. However, you can certainly influence the way the secondary character behaves. For example, you can command the second character to "wait here" while you move on ahead, or you can command the secondary character to follow you. Furthermore, you can decide whether or not you want the secondary character to actually attack enemies or to simply stand still and do nothing. When both characters are in the same room, you can use the C Stick to physically move your partner around (which is very useful, particularly if you need to be covered while you do some exploring). And unfortunately, if your partner dies, the game ends for both characters. In some cases, one character will end up being attacked by zombies whilst you (with the primary character under your control) might be in a totally different area. This problem is overcome by a kind of warning system; when the non-active character is being attacked, he/she will cry out for help via radio link. And at that point, you can quickly switch between characters and take care of the problem.<p>

The two character system has the added benefit of being able to manage more items with greater ease.  In <i>Resident Evil 0</i> you can quickly and easily swap items between characters; you can even drop items on the floor anywhere in the game if you wish. This makes item management a whole lot easier. Past <i>Resident Evil</i> games were very tight with item management, in terms of the sheer number of carriable items as well as the storage of items.<p>

Visually, <i>Resident Evil 0</i> is looking to be one of the best (if not <i>the</i> best) looking GameCube game produced so far. It utilizes the same style as the original <i>Resident Evil</i> on GameCube; high detail, animated FMV backgrounds with real time polygonal models layered over the top. The effect looked absolutely amazing in the first game, but it looks even better in <i>Resident Evil 0</i>. The fact that the game takes place on a moving train indicates that there are plenty of instances where the developers are able to use some very cool effects. Some scenes show the train car rumbling from side to side as shadows pass over everything inside. That effect in particular looks amazing, especially because the shapes outside the train cast shadows over every single object within the carriage, including the characters and zombies. The rumbling motion of the train also allows for some very pretty liquid effects; the sink in the train's kitchen is full of water and as the train moves, it fluidly and realistically splashes from side to side.<p>

<i>Resident Evil 0</i> is to be released in the USA on October 26, 2002. And even before the game's Japanese release, the anticipation seems to be building (as evidenced by Famitsu's most wanted game list). When the game is available in the USA, we'll have a full review.<p>
