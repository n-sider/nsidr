Not content to rest on their laurels with their previous efforts to make <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2590">a DS-like phone</a>, Japanese telecom operator NTT DoCoMo Inc. has now unveiled <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUST9600820070423">a new handset</a> that incorporates Wii-like motion-sensing capabilities.<br />
<br />
The D904i, made by Mitsubishi, features motion sensors that can be used for gameplay by allowing the player to swing the phone like a tennis racket or wield it like a sword, all of which sounds awfully familiar to those of us who've experienced Wii.  What doesn't seem to be addressed: how players are supposed to look at the phone's screen while they are swinging the phone around wildly.<br />
<br />
In addition to the D904i, DoCoMo is also bringing phones from Sharp and Matsushita that use a camera to detect motion&mdash;something the Wii Remote also does, in conjunction with Wii's sensor bar.
