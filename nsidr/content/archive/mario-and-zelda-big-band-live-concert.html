<p>Someone was kind enough to upload the "Mario & Zelda Big Band Live" concert that was held all the way back on September 14, 2003.  The concert was performed in the Nihon Seinenkan Hall in Tokyo, Japan, and featured live performances of Mario and Zelda music arranged into various styles including jazz, Latin, country, and bluegrass. The host was the well-known <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=486">Benimaru Itoh</a>, who opened the concert with a guitar arrangement of the original main theme for Super Mario Bros.
