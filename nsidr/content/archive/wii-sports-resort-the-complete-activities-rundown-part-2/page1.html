Yesterday, we covered the gameplay details of <i>Wii Sports Resort</i>'s <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/wii-sports-resort-the-complete-activities-rundown">first four sports</a>&mdash;Swordplay, Wakeboarding, Frisbee, and Archery&mdash;along with each and every one of their included activities.<br />
<br />
Today we're going to bring you a more nostalgia-heavy lineup, including two direct updates and one other sport that's changed markedly from the original <i>Wii Sports</i>, as well as one totally new sport.  The lineup: Basketball, Table Tennis, Golf, and Bowling.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
<a name="basketball"></a><div class="header">Basketball</div><br />
The basics of Basketball are pretty straightforward, yet difficult to master.  Once you've grabbed the ball, hold the MotionPlus-equipped Wii Remote over your head, and make a tossing motion as if you were throwing the basketball into the net.  Of course, not getting enough lift or tossing it off to one side or the other is going to hurt you quite a bit here.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">3-Point Contest</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
At five points from behind the three-point line are five basketballs each&mdash;four normal balls, worth one point each, and a bonus ball worth two.  Within 60 seconds, you'll need to shoot as many as you can by pointing the Remote forwards and pressing B, then making the aforementioned shooting motion.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-1.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Hot Streak: Get five consecutive shots into the net.</li>
  <li>Bonus Plumber: Get all five bonus balls into the net.</li>
  <li>Quick Draw: Score 20 points or more with at least 10 seconds left on the clock.</li>
  <li>Hot Hand: Get all 25 balls into the net.</li>
  <li>Pure Shooter: Get all 25 balls into the net with at least 15 seconds left on the clock.</li>
  </ul><br />
<div class="subheader">Pickup Game</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1 (vs. CPU) or 2 (simutaneous)<br />
<br />
In this three-minute, 3-on-3, rather slow-paced game, you can choose to pass to either of your other teammates by pressing A or the d-pad.  Once in said teammate's hand and the shot clock starts ticking, tap B to set up for a shot, then make it as explained above&mdash;or pass again.  You can dribble the ball and push your defender back by making little dribbling motions with the Remote and get yourself directly under the net for a slam dunk, which requires you to make a shooting motion at just the right time.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-2.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
When you're on defense, you can either try to steal a dribbled ball by swiping your Remote in front of you, or block a jump shot by thrusting your Remote upward at the right moment.  Offense and defense alternate until time is called.<br />
<br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Triple Dip: Score a goal from beyond the 3-point line.</li>
  <li>Rim Rattler: Dunk the ball five times in one game.</li>
  <li>Lights Out: Score five 3-point shots in one game.</li>
  <li>Buzzer Beater: Make a last-second shot that scores just before the buzzer signals the end fo the game.</li>
  <li>Hoop Hero: Defeat the champions.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>All stamps are only available in single-player.</i><br />
<br />
<a name="tabletennis"></a><div class="header">Table Tennis</div><br />
Table Tennis is not too much unlike <i>Wii Sports</i>' Tennis, except a bit faster-paced and, thanks to MotionPlus, featuring <i>much</i> easier paddle control to let you put spin on the ball.  Just twist your wrist appropriately.  <br />
<br />
Once again, your Mii moves automatically.  All you need to worry about is hitting the ball with swings of your Wii Remote.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Match</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1 (vs. CPU) or 2 (simultaneous)<br />
<br />
Match is pretty much the traditional table tennis match.  Each player gets two opportunities to serve the ball (press A, then swing the Remote), then the other player gets his turn.  Keep the ball in play by beating it back with swings of your Remote, and try to get the other player to miss.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-3.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>In Your Face: Hit your opponent's face with the ball.</li>
  <li>Back From the Brink: Return a ball that has hit the edge of the table, bouncing at an unpredictable angle.</li>
  <li>Epic Rally: Keep up a rally for 30 hits or more.</li>
  <li>Perfectly Matched: Draw your opponent to 20-20.  To keep the game going, neither player may get two points ahead.</li>
  <li>Table Titan: Beat the champion.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>All stamps are available in single-player mode only.</i><br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Return Challenge</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating)<br />
<br />
Return as many shots as you can without going out of bounds.  Cans will appear on the opposite side of the table; if you hit them, you get 3 bonus points.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-4.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
