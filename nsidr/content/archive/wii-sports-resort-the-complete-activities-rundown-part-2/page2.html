<a name="golf"></a><div class="header">Golf</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
This update to <i>Wii Sports</i> original Golf game features twice the holes to golf on (nine "Classic" and nine "Resort") as well as MotionPlus-enhanced control.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-5.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
Select your club and angle your shot, taking the course and wind into account, with the d-pad; when you're ready to take your shot, hold the Remote in both hands, pointed toward the ground, and tap B.  You'll notice when you're taking practice swings that not only is your power measured on the power meter, but if you curve your club to the left or the right, the meter will flex in that direction&mdash;and your ball will respond appropriately.<br />
<br />
When you're ready to hit the ball for real, hold A and take your swing.<br />
<br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Under Par: Finish any course under par.</li>
  <li>Chip In: Get your chip shot (a short shot used to get the ball onto the green) to fall or roll straight into the hole.</li>
  <li>King of Clubs: Finish any course at 9 under par.</li>
  <li>Ace of Clubs: Finish any course at 18 under par.</li>
  <li>Hole in One: Hit the ball into the hole in a single shot.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>Under Par, King of Clubs, and Ace of Clubs are not available in team play.</i><br />
<br />
<a name="bowling"></a><div class="header">Bowling</div><br />
One of <i>Wii Sports</i>' most popular games makes its return in <i>Resort</i>, and much like Golf, it's not changed much.  The biggest difference is the availability of Automatic control, which will release the ball automatically at the appropriate time as you swing your arm in a throwing motion with the Wii Remote in your hand.  <i>Wii Sports</i> veterans are advised to stick to Manual, which once again counts on you to release the B button when you're ready to throw the ball.<br />
<br />
Wii MotionPlus does seem to make spins and such more reliable and easier to pull off in <i>Resort</i>, but its effect is not nearly as pronounced as it is in Golf.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Standard Game</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
Bowl ten frames with ten pins.  Which, of course, leads to the question: what's <i>non</i>-standard...?<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-6.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Gobble Gobble: Throw three strikes in a row to get a turkey.</li>
  <li>Split Spare: Complete a spare after a split on your first throw.</li>
  <li>High Roller: Get 200 points or more.</li>
  <li>Pin Dropper: Get a strike or spare on every frame (except the third throw of the 10th frame, which doesn't count.)</li>
  <li>Perfect Game: Bowl twelve strikes in a row.</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>Gobble Gobble, High Roller, Pin Dropper, and Perfect Game are not available in team play.</i><br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">100-Pin Game</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
Bowl ten frames with <i>100</i> pins&mdash;something that was only seen in a special mode in <i>Wii Sports</i> before, and then only for one frame.  It's actually not too hard to knock all these pins down, either&mdash;and there are no gutters, unlike in a standard game.  Maximum score is 3,000 points.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-7.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Super Strike: Bowl a strike, knocking all 100 pins down.</li>
  <li>Split Spare: Complete a spare after a split on your first throw.</li>
  <li>Off the Wall: Hit the gutter guard once, then get a strike.</li>
  <li>Secret Strike: Get a strike in an unusual way, using the gutter guards.</li>
  <li>Pin Dropper: Get a strike or spare on every frame (except the third throw of the 10th frame, which doesn't count.)</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>Pin Dropper is not available in team play.</i><br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Spin Control</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating; free-for-all or teams)<br />
<br />
Another returning mode from <i>Wii Sports</i>, though this time it might be a bit easier due to MotionPlus' influence making spins easier to pull off.  Various static and moving barriers are in the lane; bowl around them and see if you can still manage to keep your score up.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3934-8.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>One for All: Knock down at least one pin in every frame.</li>
  <li>Split Spare: Complete a spare after a split on your first throw.</li>
  <li>Head First: Knock down the head pin in every frame.</li>
  <li>English Major: Score 170 points or more without hitting any barriers.</li>
  <li>Pin Dropper: Get a strike or spare on every frame (except the third throw of the 10th frame, which doesn't count.)</li>
  </ul><br />
<i>One for All, Head First, English Major, and Pin Dropper are not available in team play.</i><br />
