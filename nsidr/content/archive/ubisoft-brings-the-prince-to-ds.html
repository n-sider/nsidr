Ubisoft has announced details regarding the upcoming <i>Prince of Persia</i> title for the Nintendo DS. The game utilizes a new gameplay element not commonly associated with the series.  Instead of the fast-action platforming and fighting used in past games, <i>Battles of Prince of Persia</i> will instead be a card-based battle game. The story takes place between the two home console versions - Sands of Time and Warrior Within.  In the game, players are said to command units and troops within a familiar interface and control fights via a card battle system.
