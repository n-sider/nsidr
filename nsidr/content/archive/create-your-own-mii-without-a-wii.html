<p>Looking to practice your Mii making skills before the November 19 launch?  A savvy Nintendo fan from website <a href="http://www.joystiq.com">Joystiq</a> has heard your request and developed a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/media/2006/10/mii.swf">Mii application</a>.  The nifty program lets you develop your very own Mii face.  Check it out while pretending your mouse is a Wiimote.</p>
