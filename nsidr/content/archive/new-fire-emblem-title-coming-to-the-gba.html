<p>Japanese magazine Shonen Jump revealed a new title in the <i>Fire Emblem</i> series for the Game Boy Advance. The name, roughly translated to <i>Fire Emblem: The Shining Stones of Good & Evil</i>, will feature two main characters who are twins.  The story, which takes place in the Kingdom of Luness, will revolve around two diametrically opposed stones. There will be two possibilities to choose from when characters upgrade in a particular class.  Additional information, including release dates will be announced in the future.</p>
