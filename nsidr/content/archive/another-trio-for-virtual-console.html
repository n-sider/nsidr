It's the dawn of a new week once again and you know what that means!<br />
<br />
VIRTUAL CONSOLE MONDAY<br />
<br />

<ul>
  <li><i>Gradius</i> (NES, 1-2 players, 500 Wii Points) </li>
  <li><i>Soldier Blade</i> (TurboGrafx16, 1 player, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Dungeon Explorer</i> (TurboGrafx16, 1-5 players, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
Of particular note is Dungeon Explorer's repeat appearance on the release list; emulation issues kept it from hitting the Wii Shop Channel as expected over the holidays.  Aside from the Advance Wars-themed Dungeon Explorer though, Gradius and Soldier Blade are both solidly enjoyable titles for the shooters among us!
