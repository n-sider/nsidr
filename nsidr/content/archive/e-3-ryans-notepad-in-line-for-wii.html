<p>Because the N-Sider staff carried "early-access media" badges at this year's E3 -- yes, we're that awesome -- we were able to get into the LACC's West Hall at 9:00 am on Wednesday morning (as opposed to 11:00 am, for the rest of the show-floor attendees). This means we were among the first in the world to get our hands on Nintendo's newest console offering, the Wii. I got up extra early that morning and had my notepad with me in line. What was it like? Well, you know what they say: a picture is worth a thousand words, but a picture <b>OF</b> words is worth, like... way more. Okay, so I made that last bit up. Sue me. Better yet, check out my live notes for yourself:</p>

<p>And the rest is history. What was the fruit of my labor? Let's just say I got my ass kicked and my name taken.</p>
