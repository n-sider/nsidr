Meetroduction will release an instant messenger program called <i>Meetro</i> for the Nintendo DS, according to <a href="http://nintendoinsider.com/site/EEkuFAyluAHuhWnZnZ.php">NintendoInsider.com</a>. In addition to its instant messaging capabilities (AIM, ICQ and Yahoo support), Meetro is said to show the proximity in miles of how far away each user is from each other and includes taglines, user pictures and an extensive customizable user profile.

"We've entered an early stage of development for handheld console support, which includes both Sony PSP and Nintendo DS," CEO Paul Bragiel told NintendoInsider.  "We see the DS and PSP as platforms that were designed to be used for applications besides games. We want to bring social software to these machines."

The <i>Meetro</i> software is currently scheduled for release summer 2006.
