I found this to be an amusing quote.

<blockquote><font size="2">Is Nintendo mad? That depends on whether you consider it insane for a company to launch a product with low manufacturing costs, easy software development, high margins and strong brands and franchises backing it, at a price significantly lower than its rivals can compete with. If that's considered to be mad, then how do you describe the business of launching a vastly expensive, cutting-edge box, after the investment of billions of dollars in research and development and developer acquisitions, each hardware unit subsidised to the hilt in the hope of clawing back your investment on future software licences? In our insane industry, Nintendo may even be a pillar of sanity."</font></blockquote>

This quote comes by way of Rob Fahey of <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=13579">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.  It's a well-crafted argument for Nintendo's stance in the next-generation.  What are your <a href="mailto:news@n-sider.com">thoughts</a>?<br><br>
Thanks to N-Forums users Apple of Enlightenment and Joey for pointing our attention towards the article.
