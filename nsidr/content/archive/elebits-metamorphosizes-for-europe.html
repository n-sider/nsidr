Konami's Wii launch window title <i>Elebits</i> is headed for Europe in the spring, but Europeans following its release in Japan and North America might not recognize it when it gets there.<br />
<br />
The title is now apparently "Eledees", and it's slated to <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=71556">hit Europe this spring</a>.  Konami seems to be changing more than the name; the Elebit cookies, which you could break against the floor to woo Elebits out of hiding for a limited time, is apparently now <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=152365">a canister of "love gas"</a>.<br />
<br />
Elebits, despite <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2457">taking a TGS best-in-show award</a>, did relatively poorly in its home country, though anecdotally, sales are picking up here now that 2006 has come and gone.  Time and sales figures will tell whether it becomes a memorable part of Wii's launch.
