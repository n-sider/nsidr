<p>Yukihito Morikawa, president of Japanese developer Muumuu, said in his online diary that the rumored recommended retail price of Nintendo DS games will be about 3,800 yen ($35) in Japan.</p> 

<p>Morikawa says he feels the price will be too high and developers will be unable to create smaller titles, according to GameSpot.com.  He says the games will have to be more in-depth to justify the price to consumers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I heard from a producer that a few DS projects going on in his company are deadlocked, says Morikawa in his diary. There are a lot of new things that can be done [with the touch-sensitive screen], such as making hand drawn characters fight with each other or transforming a 3D object with the use of the stylus. You can bang [in the game] with the stylus, dig holes, chip away things... it's easy to come up with those kinds of small ideas, and the DS is a superb hardware in that sense.</p> 

<p>"But, those kinds of ideas are too small to fit in a 3,800 yen cartridge, which is why [the developers] are deadlocked, continues Morikawa. It's difficult to expand on those types of small ideas, kind of like how a short story won't become a good novel if you bloat it up with unnecessary ideas. So the only way to fill a 3,800 yen cartridge is by stuffing in one huge idea or a lot of small ideas. But we cant stuff in a bunch of small ideas, because thats something which is already going to be done with Made in Wario [WarioWare, Inc. DS]."</p>
