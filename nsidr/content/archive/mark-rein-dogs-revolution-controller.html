Vice President of Epic Games, Mark Rein has some apparent distaste for Revolution's controller, as seen in <a href="http://media.cube.ign.com/articles/661/661405/vids_1.html">this video</a> from the IGN Live Next-Gen Panel. He insists games will be "all about the graphics" in the upcoming generation, and that Nintendo fans are in for "crappy, cheap, I-wish-I-hadn't-bought-it gimmicks".

Although developers in Japan are praising Nintendo's efforts almost daily, there appears to be mixed feelings at Epic Games and other western studios. What are your thoughts?
