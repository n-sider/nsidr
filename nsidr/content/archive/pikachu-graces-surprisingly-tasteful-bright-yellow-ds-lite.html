How can you have multimillion-selling Pok&eacute;mon games without a limited-edition Pok&eacute;mon-branded system to play them on?  If you're in Japan, you don't have to worry about this question any longer: a special edition Pikachu DS Lite has been unveiled which, despite the bright yellow color, is actually pretty tasteful.<br />

Unlike other special edition DS Lites, this one is actually limited-edition and will be sold through a lottery system.  Lottery winners will be able to pick up their system in the purchase period&mdash;July 20 through August 19&mdash;for 16,800 yen (about US$138 at today's exchange rates).  Again, it's limited to Japan; so if you live anywhere else, you'll have to pull some serious strings to get your hands on one of these.
