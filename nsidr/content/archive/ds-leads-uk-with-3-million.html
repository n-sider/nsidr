Nintendo UK boss David Yarnton wants you to know that the Nintendo DS is the UK's hottest handheld by a long shot, selling over three million units in the UK alone.<br />
<br />
The dual-screened wonder was the best-selling platform in 2006 and, as Nintendo says, is already "the UK market leading hardware format again so far in 2007".  Yarnton expects even more: "With many more Touch! Generations games launching in 2007, Nintendo DS and Wii will continue to be the main driving forces behind the expansion of the videogame market this year."
