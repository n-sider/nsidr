<p>GameSpot is reporting that an EB Games employee has seen GameCube posters with GameCube-branded blank stickers and <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148626.html">bearing the words "New Low Price"</a>, intended for use in Nintendo's next marketing period running May 3 through May 23.  The intent is that should a price drop be announced, employees will be able to write the new price onto the sticker.</p>

<p>The Nintendo GameCube is currently the lowest-priced current-generation console at retail, selling for $99.99 MSRP.  Nintendo's E3 press conference, scheduled to take place May 8 at
9:30 A.M. at the Kodak Theater, is a very likely event for any price drops to be announced at.</p>
