The latest <i>Nintendo Power</i> revealed that the DS remake of the first game in the Front Mission series is now coming to America. <i>Front Mission</i> was released on the SNES in 1995 but never came to America. Called <i>Front Mission 1st</i> in Japan, the game is being retitled to its original name for the US release.<br />
<br />
Front Mission is a long-running series developed by Square-Enix where players control an army of mechs, called Wanzers, in a turn-based strategy role-playing game. Wanzers can be customized with different legs, arms, torsos, computers, and weapons, each of which affect the Wanzer's abilities on the field. Each body part has its own hit points, and destroying those parts will affect the Wanzer in different ways for the rest of the battle.<br />
<br />
The DS remake obviously features some improvements and additions over the original. Players can control their Wanzers via the map on the touch screen, and when a battle occurs, the battle scene takes place on the top screen so the map is contantly visible. Outside of battle scenes, the top screen displays important data about the Wanzers. The DS remake also comes with brand new multiplayer battles thanks to local wireless.<br />

The Japanese release of Front Mission hit stores March 22, 2007, but The American release does not currently have a set release date.
