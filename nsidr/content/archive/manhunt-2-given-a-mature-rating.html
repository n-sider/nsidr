After Rockstar's grotesque horror game <i>Manhunt 2</i> was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2881">given an AO rating</a> in June, Rockstar set its eyes on toning down some of the more extreme aspects of the game. If they hadn't, Nintendo and Sony would have refused to license the game for release on their respective consoles.<br />
<br />
Now, after another submission to the ESRB, Manhunt 2 has received a Mature rating, which means that the game is once again open for a release on Wii, PS2, and PSP.<br />
<br />
Manhunt 2 is expected to hit North American shelves October 31 this year. There is no word, yet, on whether the ban will be lifted in the UK or Italy.
