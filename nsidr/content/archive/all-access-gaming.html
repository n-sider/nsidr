  "In the universe of interactive entertainment, there is a planet we call video games. It is the one we know best. But ... it is only one. Also in our universe are other planets which entertain, but in different ways from current games. It is this part of the universe we are anxious to explore. So, this idea creates the dual passions of Nintendo. On one hand, we work every day to make what we describe as "video games" better. We want to give players what they want. But at the same time, we are intent on finding out what else we can use to entertain. Our second goal is to show players something new -- something they may not even know they want."<br> - <b>Satoru Iwata</b>, GDC

<h2>All-Access Gaming</h2>

<p>I'd like to refine and focus our speculation on the facts.  Hopefully this will allow us to be a bit more productive and produce something that is more reasonably the Revolution.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-06-14-revolution.jpg" border="0" align="left"><b>Question:</b> The Revolution?<br><br>

<b>Answer:</b> All-Access Gaming</p>

<p>There it is.  Many of us assumed the Revolution would originate from a single revolutionary aspect of the console.  Maybe holograms? Perhaps gyroscopes? Possibly levitating koopas? Instead, what we've come to learn is that the Revolution's 'revolution' is a product of many circumstances and many parts.</p>

<p>This should not come as a huge surprise to anyone.  The 'console' was the object codenamed Revolution after all -- not the controller, not the development environment, and not the wireless network.  Rather, "Revolution" is the collection and combination of many pieces -- from the hardware, to the controller, to the Wi-Fi network, to the virtual gaming catalogue, to the development environment, to the philosophy... and more.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
"The Revolution will use cutting edge technology, but it's ultimately about how that technology is used.  We asked ourselves 'why would a family need or want to have a gaming console?' The answer is what's driving development of the Revolution." - <b>Shigeru Miyamoto</b>, CNNMoney
</font></blockquote>

<p>Still, what the heck is "all-access gaming"?</p>

<p>Put simply, it's the term applied to Nintendo's next-generation philosophy.  This isn't a concept that was produced out of thin air.  It is a principle the company has supported since it first began creating video games out of sprites.  Nintendo wants to retain the interest of core-gamers with beautiful and elaborate games, attract casual gamers using "friendly content, control and interface" and even draw those individuals who have are hesitant or not knowledgeable enough to label themselves a 'gamer'.  The culmination of this dream has perhaps only been limited by technology and the market's readiness.</p>

<p>The technology is now clearly available otherwise Nintendo would not have announced the project.  However, the question still lingers: is the market ready?  If sales of Nintendo DS are any indication (sales exceeded five million in April), the answer is "yes".  Douglas Lowenstein, president of The Entertainment Software Association, emphasized the point during his 2005 pre-E3 speech that the gaming industry must open its eyes and explore new territories if it ever hopes to grow into a respected entertainment form.  Developers need to create games with more mass-market appeal with more compelling game experiences, he pleaded.  Games need to be more accessible, easier to play and the platforms they appear on need to appeal to bigger audiences, Lowenstein continued.  New sources of financing for game development also need to be created, he noted.  And finally, we need to overcome the cultural resistance and fear of videogames.  Although we've come a long way in the past 20 years, we must not become complacent since there is still a long ways to go.  After all, we have not yet reached a point where a video game is considered a piece of art --  admired like a song from the Beatles or a tale from Shakespeare.  And so regardless of whether the market is ready, Nintendo is putting its money where its mouth is.  Perhaps most importantly, Nintendo is taking action.</p>

<p>Although the proposition of "all-access gaming" is simple by nature, grasping the idea is not always so easy.  All-Access Gaming is the combination of a multitude of features.  According to Nintendo...</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<i>"The next console fits anywhere. It brings together new games and old. It gives people worldwide access through wireless Wi-Fi connections. And it opens the world of video games -- to everyone. Software for the new console will even attract people who dont consider themselves players. Adults, kids, men and women around the world will have access to the most popular video game characters, the best game franchises and the most engaging experiences yet developed -- only with Nintendo."</i>
</font></blockquote>



<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Games :.</b></font></p>

<p>In other words, video games like other forms of entertainment, have the potential to appeal to everyone.  Nintendo hopes advanced technology nurtured by creative ideas will finally break the barrier that has thus far prevented 'all-access gaming' from becoming reality.</p>

<p>It is true.  There is an absolute barrier to entry.  There are people who haven't picked up a controller since the NES days simply because there are too many buttons.  Even this website N-Sider.com for example, has significant barriers to entry.  We assume, in our articles, that our readers have a basic understanding of video games and Nintendo.  We assume you know who Shigeru Miyamoto is (the creator of the Mario and Legend of Zelda series).  It shouldn't come as a surprise to know then that the Nintendo community's inside jokes about Reggie are unknown to 99 percent of consumers.  Heck, we even assume you know how to navigate a web page. Clearly, not everyone does. Consequently these are all barriers to entry.</p>

<p>The more barriers that are removed, the better chance we will have of attracting more readers or in Nintendo's case, more game players.  Two key barriers Nintendo intends on breaking down are in the areas of <b>"interface"</b> and <b>"community"</b>.  Pierre-Paul Trepanier, Nintendo of Canadas Director of Marketing said, "Were throwing open the doors of gaming to wider audiences, from casual players to hard-core gamers. We are dedicated to delivering a revolutionary game experience for all people to embrace."  Don't think Nintendo is alone in this observation.  There are others in the industry who share Nintendo's view.</p>

<p>Bruce Bonnell, chairman of Atari recently told MCV, "It will be systematic in our future games where you can access any level of the game at any time, even on the first try.  When you buy a DVD you can watch the end if you want to, and why shouldn't you?  You've paid for it.  We have to make more accessible games.  We should go from the opera structure to the LP structure where you can access any song at any time."</p>

<p>It's true that games are often played for reward or for the achievement of beating a boss or level.  That's good for gamers who yearn for that satisfaction.  But what about everyone else?  There should be games for them too.  Games where you can play at your leisure or play to your specifications.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
"...software sells hardware. People buy hardware to play the games they love. I agree with Steve Jobs, the head of Apple, when he says, "Software is the user experience." Software is the driving technology not just of computers, but of all consumer electronics..." - <b>Satoru Iwata</b>, GDC 2005
</font></blockquote>

<p>Games are clearly the most important aspect of Revolution -- or any hardware, for that matter.  But as we'll see, technology too can assist in turning great ideas into great games.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Backwards-Compatibility :.</b></font></p>

<p>Another cog that turns Revolution's revolutionary wheel is backwards-compatibility.  Its been announced that the new console will play all games from the current Nintendo GameCube generation. But there's more to it.  The console will also have downloadable access to 20 years of fan-favorite titles originally released for Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo Entertainment System.  Nintendo plans to utilize pay downloads as the standard for this system however there is the possibility for many types of services including free limited-time downloads or bonus downloads for the purchase of new games.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Storage and Expansion :.</b></font></p>

<p>Downloads will be stored in flash memory. Players will be able to store game and game data in 512 megabytes of flash memory.  If this space is filled, users can transfer downloads to an SD memory card or use a PC to manage files. The company chose flash memory over a hard disk because it is more durable, reliable and cheaper. The flash memory could also potentially be used to save game data, update the Revolution firmware, and download Revolution demos.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Design :.</b></font></p>

<p>Another aspect that may not be as apparent, despite it looking right at you, is the hardware's design. The new console boasts high-quality materials and a smart, compact design, approximately the size of three standard DVD cases stacked together. It's almost portable... A variety of prototype colors were showcased during E3 and the system will come with a silver stand so that it can sit vertically.  Finally, the console is said to be exceptionally quiet and consume little power.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Format :.</b></font></p>

<p>Revolution will support two disc formats. Instead of a tray, a single, innovative, self-loading media bay will play both 12-centimeter optical discs used for the new system as well as Nintendo GameCube discs. Furthermore, owners will have the option of equipping a small, self-contained attachment to play movies and other DVD content.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Cost :.</b></font></p>

<p>Cost for consumer and cost for developer will be minimal.  Consumers will use a free Wi-Fi gaming service via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Developers will likewise have the freedom of design.  A new development architecture will accommodate both big-budget "masterpieces" as well as artistic, indie offerings designed to make sure that everyone from video game experts to newcomers find ways to share and enjoy the gaming experience.  Development will not require a steep new learning curve. In this way, just like Nintendo DS, its a place where the best ideas "not the biggest budgets" will win.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Technology :.</b></font></p>

<p>The system boasts 512 megabytes of internal flash memory, wireless controllers, two USB 2.0 ports and built-in Wi-Fi access. Revolutions technological heart, a processing chip developed with IBM and code-named "Broadway," and a graphics chip set from ATI code-named "Hollywood," will deliver game experiences not previously possible.  "With IBM, we are creating Revolution's core processor, which we have codenamed Broadway because Broadway is the capital of live entertainment," said Satoru Iwata. "With ATI, we are developing the graphics chipset, codenamed Hollywood because Hollywood is the capital of movie entertainment. With Revolution, we are determined to create the new capital of interactive entertainment."</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Controller :.</b></font></p>

<p>I've saved the two most important components for last.  The controller is going to be a key piece in the Revolution.  It is also un-coincidentally the component we know the least about.  In addition to IBM's processor and ATI's graphic chip pushing Revolution's potential, Nintendo has been working with wireless specialist Broadcom to develop its controllers. Overall, we can expect to have controllers created solely with "all-access gaming" in mind -- something that appeals to gamers as well as non-gamers.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>.: Wireless Interaction :.</b></font></p>

<p>The last aspect of the Revolution, and perhaps the most important piece of the pie, is the interaction between the console, controller and television.  It is where the "new gaming experience" will allegedly be born.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a> and Nintendo's Integrated Research & Development department is working together with Broadcom on Revolution's wireless technology.  I can assure you one thing, we haven't seen the last of connectivity.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
"We invented the current way a console is played - in front of a television and holding a controller - but maybe that image will change." - <b>Satoru Iwata</b>, May 13, 2004
</font></blockquote>

<p>As it previously defined what four-player gaming was, Nintendo will again come to define what wireless gaming is.  A number of Wi-Fi-enabled launch titles are in development that will employ Nintendos newly announced wireless gaming service, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. A worldwide network of Nintendo players can gather to compete in a comfortable, inviting environment.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
"We believe that the consumer wants more in the area of community, and we are looking at how to deliver that. We think the online approach of today is a bit flawed. We think the consumer wants a better way. And that's what we're looking to do with Revolution. What I am saying is that with our next home console we will address the area of gamer community. You said "online." I used "online" as a description of a flawed business model. We are passionate about enabling our gamers to play with their friends [and] to play with others across long distances. There are a number of different ways to execute that." - <b>Reginald Fils-Aime</b>, EGM
</font></blockquote>

<h3>Barriers and Conclusion?</h3>

<p>Barriers still obviously remain to us reaching this "all-access gaming" utopia.  Until I can play Super Mario 64 on my cell phone or my PC, the core of "all-access gaming" won't be realized.  The ability to access a game anytime and anywhere would truly be a Revolution.  Will Nintendo make it happen?  If not, perhaps the upcoming Revolution is but merely a prelude to the real revolution.</p>

<p>I have a cog, a battery, a minute hand, an hour hand, and a second hand.  Alone, these are nothing more than an assortment of items.  It is only when you combine these that you create a clock.  This idea applies to Revolution.  Only when you combine the games, backwards-compatibility, storage and expansion, design, format, cost and development environment, technology, controller, and wireless interaction do you finally see the Revolution... as well as the revolution.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-06-14-revolution2.jpg" border="0"></p>

<h3>Speculation...</h3>

<p>Now then, there are several pieces to this puzzle that have been uncovered.  However, this still leaves us with many surprises.  The controller has been speculated to death and at this point we're simply waiting to see it.  So lets instead take some time to discuss the "wireless interaction".</p>

<p>Shigeru Miyamoto is known to be working closely on the Revolution controller.  Recently, Miyamoto said he was working closely with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=551">Satoru Okada</a>.  Okada is known to be the head of Nintendo's Research & Engineering department which has been responsible for the development of Nintendo's portable hardware.  Miyamoto works with individuals from all departments so it's probably nothing to get too excited about.  However, when you combine this with other aspects of Nintendo's initiative, you begin to wonder.  The small size of the console, the ability to download classic games, the emphasis on wireless transfer of data...  What would make all of this useful?  Connectivity.  Perhaps a controller that doubles as a portable game-playing device?  Or maybe the controller is just that while another device will be available (sold separately) that can be used as the portable Revolution?  How neat would it be to play Mario NES on your Revolution or transfer it and play it on your Revolution Boy?  It makes complete sense... if you can overlook the barrier of cost.  So although I don't believe the company is doing this now, chances are very good it will during one of the upcoming console generations.</p>

<p>Now then, I've presented one idea.  Not entirely realistic, I know.  So lets not dwell on it too much.  I'd like to hear other possibilities.  So, lets go over this once again and we'll continue this discussion in the N-Forums or via email.</p>

<p>Iwata says the following information will provoke much more informed speculation (as organized by Nintendo Power magazine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>First</b>, in addition to IBM's processor and ATI's graphic chip pushing its potential, Nintendo has been working with wireless specialist Broadcom to develop its controllers.</p>

<p><b>Second</b>, the Revolution will be more than simply backward-compatible with GCN discs; the device will be a "virtual console" that can download many forms of content.  Iwata says that not only means new levels and characters for retail titles, but also can extend to games originally created for the Nintendo 64, Super NES and even the NES.</p>

<p><b>Third</b>, Revolution titles will play on standard, double-layered DVDs; owners will have the option to use a small attachment to play DVD movies... ...the media drive will also accept the smaller GCN discs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking these three factors into account, Iwata says that every home system has had a player holding a controller, connected to a console, connected to a TV.  He reasserts that the Revolution will take an entirely new approach to the interaction between the console, TV, controller, and now Wi-Fi.  The million dollar question is, how will that Revolutionize gameplay and Nintendo's franchises?</p>

<p>"The advantage in our technology will relate to areas that have no direct bearing on gameplay."</p>
