<p>In what's shaping up to be a long-running soap opera involving NGC, Revolution, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911"><i>Zelda: Twilight Princess</i></a>, NGC has <a href="http://www.pressstartonline.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=232&Itemid=70">countered</a> Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1638">classification of their story as "speculation"</a> in a statement to Press Start Online:</p>

<blockquote><p>Martin Kitts claimed: "The news came from somebody senior at Nintendo who, admittedly, probably shouldn't have let it slip before E3. But they did, and we would have been crazy not to print it. Next thing you know, instead of a brilliant news exclusive, we've got somebody else at Nintendo issuing a carefully worded non-denial, and various sites that specialise in rumours are telling the world that NGC is not to be trusted. So to clear things up, that news piece wasn't a load of bull  it's direct from the people who are making the game."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, readers should note that while Nintendo makes "carefully worded non-denials", it's also important to remember that the NGC article was the apparent news plus several pages of imagining how the control would work in <i>Princess</i>.  The article wasn't committing to any sort of specific control options; anything could satisfy the Revolution option, from a fishing minigame to tilting the "shell" to aim arrows to full-blown reimagining of the entire game.</p>

<p>As for me, I'm hanging up my prediction hat.  With any luck, the above statement pegs this coming E3 as the timeframe we'll learn the truth.  Until then, I for one will be waiting anxiously to find out just what  if anything  they've done to <i>Princess</i>.</p>
