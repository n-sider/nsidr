<H2 ALIGN="center">- Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes - Custom Boxart</h2>

<p>Our intent for this replacement cover is to offer a great alternative to the retail box art.  Although some are fond of the official retail cover slip for Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes we still want to give you, the reader, the option to stay closer to the series box-art lineage.</p>

<p>For best results, ensure that you print at the highest quality on landscape and at the natural resolution.  If you are unsure, print a low quality test page before moving on to a final print job with the best quality (and with it, more of that pricey ink).</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> April 01, 2004 - Fixed Meryl codec screen.</p>
