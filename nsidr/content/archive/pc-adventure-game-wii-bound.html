The Adventure Company, publishers of (you guessed it) PC adventure games, has announced they will be bringing one of their Agatha Christie murder mystery titles to Wii.<br />
<br />
<i>Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None</i> will maintain the traditional PC play style but add some Wii-specific gameplay elements such as using a digging motion to unearth clues, spinning the handle of a safe with the Wii Remote, and the addition of timed puzzles where, for example, players must race up a set of stairs from a boat docked below.<br />
<br />
The Adventure Company sees this as an opportunity to be the first to bring adventure titles to Wii, according to President and CEO Richard Wah Kan.  "Many PC adventure game fans are having a great time with the Wii and we'd like to be the first to deliver them games they love on a console they've embraced."<br />
<br />
The title is slated for release this coming November.
