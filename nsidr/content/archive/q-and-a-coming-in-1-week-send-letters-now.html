<p>Your beloved N-Sider Q&A Mailbag is now on a bi-weekly schedule. We're posting a new edition once every two weeks, with Brandon's Heart Containers being posted as <i>filler</i> in the off-weeks.</p>

<p>However, I have yet to see many decent letters yet. Come on guys. Travis and I are pretty cool guys. We're approachable. We'll shoot the poo on anything with ya.</p>

<p>So get cracking and send your questions, criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>.
