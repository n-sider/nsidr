<p><a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/05/15/the-engadget-and-joystiq-interview-nintendos-perrin-kaplan/">Joystiq.com</a> has posted an interview with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a>, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing and corporate affairs.  The questions were very well-posed despite Kaplan managing to dodge answers for several of them.  The discussion touches on subjects including the Virtual Console, competitors Sony and Microsoft, and what we can expect from Wii's launch.  An excerpt is below, however you're better off reading the full interview <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/05/15/the-engadget-and-joystiq-interview-nintendos-perrin-kaplan/">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> One of the things that wasn't very clear was the online interface and that service. You announced Connect24, so we kind of know that there's something going on there, but that's still pretty nebulous and we don't know how the game experience is going to change from what already exists with the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<p><b>Kaplan:</b> The two things we did announce: Opera browser, which shows that it will have wireless around the world, and then Wii Connect24 is certainly a magnificent feature. It's sort of unlimited what kind of surprises people could find when they wake up in the morning. And in the coming months there will be a lot more that we will be sharing. We tend to pick just a few items to share at E3. It's a really busy time, it's a really crowded time. There's just not enough room for everybody to be announcing everything, so we really just chose to have people focus on playing and the experience and then all the rest of it, we'll begin to share.</p>
