<p>I got the chance to play the game about 10 times, each race is an 8-player wireless race of 3 laps.

<p>Character selection is not possible, you are automatically assigned a random character.  So far the characters present in the game are:

<ul>
<li>Mario
<li>Princess Peach
<li>Wario
<li>Bowser
<li>Donkey Kong
<li>Yoshi
<li>Luigi
<li>Toad
  </ul>

<p>Gameplay-wise, it plays very similarly to a mix between <i>Super Mario Kart</i>, <i>Mario Kart 64</i>, and <i>Mario Kart: Double Dash</i>.  Powerslides are possible, as well as the mini-turbo feature as seen in <i>Double Dash</i>.

<p>So far Ive seen at least 5 different tracks, based loosely on previous games.  Theres a track akin to <i>Double Dash</i>s beach circuit, one based almost exactly from the <i>Super Mario Kart</i>s first track (Mushroom Cup, my memory is failing me at present), one based on a Ghost town, and another similar to Luigis Circuit.

<p>Winners of each race are given a prize, a radio-controlled Mario or Yoshi kart! Ive won 4 times already! :)

<p>The framerate is very smooth, if a little on the slow side, Im sure it will be improved by the time it launches.

<p>No launch date or timeframe has been given, but I will be probing further into this in the next two days.

<p>More as it develops.  Watch this space.
