<h3>Now Playing Edition 1: Second Chances - Page 1</h3>
<br>

<p><b>Edition: November 11, 2004</b>
<br>What you are about to read is hopefully the first in an ongoing series of articles where members of the N-Sider staff get a chance to bring up and discuss some of the games we have been playing lately. This is not an article of mini previews, nor is it to be taken seriously as any form of review. This is a space for our writers to talk about whatever their gaming heart desires, in a relatively compact fashion. The games discussed are not limited to Nintendo published titles nor are we limiting games to those that appear on Nintendo systems. We are all gamers here and a great game is still a great game, regardless of the console or system it may appear on. So put your biases aside and enjoy.

<p>In this edition, Jeffs love for Metroid is rejuvenated, Mark gets his <i>Top Spin</i> on, Glen plays <i>Chrono Cross</i> again for the first time, and James signs up for the <i>Guild Wars</i>.

<p>I have been a fan of the Metroid series for a very long time now. From the moment I beat <i>Super Metroid</i> in 1994 (one of my favorite games of all time) I awaited the next adventure of Samus Aran. That wait proved to be quite lengthy, with the definition of quite lengthy being nearly a decade. 

<p>I bought <i>Metroid Prime</i> as soon as it hit shelves in 2002. Nintendo had successfully done what so many once thought impossible: it had made a 3D Metroid game that met the high standards set by its 2D predecessors. Yet, for one reason or another after a few weeks I stopped playing. I cant say why I stopped exactly, but I can pinpoint my frustration to one location in the game: The Phazon Mines. The Mines lack the sense of adventure, exploration, and atmosphere that the rest of the game has. It is a section of the world that seemed too focused on combat instead of adventure. Aesthetically it felt rather dull and repetitive, when compared to areas like the Tallon Overworld, Phendrana Drifts, and Chozo Ruins. I didnt play <i>Metroid Prime</i> again for nearly two years.

<p>I always had the intention of going back and beating the game, but once youve taken a few months break from <i>MP</i>, the transition back can be difficult. So I just kept putting it off and over time my discontent with the game grew. I became angry that <i>MP</i> was the first Metroid game that hadnt compelled me enough to stick with it to the end. 

<p>However, it was about two or three weeks ago that I realized how close the release of <i>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</i> really was. With that in mind I decided to go back and truck through the Mines to see if things picked up toward the end of the game. They did. 

<p>Even though I completely forgot my way around the many areas of Tallon IV, my fondness for <i>MP</i> returned very quickly and, though a little rusty, I was soon able to hold my own. The more I played, the more my love for the game returned. Despite some extensive detours when searching out the last few Chozo Artifacts, soon enough I had all 13 and returned to the Chozo Temple for a fun and nostalgic surprise. 

<p>Though I dont want to ruin it for anyone who hasnt played, I have to say that the last few areas <i>MP</i> are amazing. The final boss battle alone was simply awesome. I havent faced an enemy that difficult in a long time. Still, the best part is that the end of the game really opens the Metroid timeline up for some fun theories. Certain aspects of Echoes make a whole lot more sense now as well.

<p>If you havent done so already, play <i>Metroid Prime</i>. Play it and beat it. Its a decision that no Metroid fan will regret.

<p>After all these months, Im still addicted to <i>Top Spin</i> (for the Xbox). Its still the best Tennis game out there. Amazing range of shots, an excellent attention to detail, and the closest thing to actually feeling like youre one of those professionals on the tour.

<p>The defining feature, and the thing that keeps the disc in the drive, is Xbox Live. Never have I had so much fun playing against all these anonymous people. Ive seen my ranking go from a fairly modest 15,000 to a pretty respectable 379 (the lower your ranking, the better youre doing). Its currently at a pretty appalling 1507 because I havent played in a few days and the last time I was online, I lost five matches in a row. There are some AWESOME players out there, legitimate ones too (not those cheating let-cord players), and its fantastic to see all of the created characters out there and the different play styles that are in use. Just like in the real world, Im forced to change my tactics on-the-fly in order to try and counter each players strategies. The multiplayer aspect of <i>Top Spin</i> is highly competitive, just as it should be.

<p>It all makes me drool at what possibilities lie in wait for <i>Mario Power Tennis</i> on the GameCube, or even DS. Camelot and Nintendo have the ability to create something truly amazing. I cant wait to get my hands on it.

<p>Wow. I cant believe it but, like Jeff, I too recently returned to <i>Metroid Prime</i>. It must be something in the air. 

<p>I still havent conquered Retros opus, and its been more than two months since I last attempted to finish <i>Metroid Prime</i>. However, recently I dusted off the game and popped it into my Cube. As always, the breathtaking graphics continue to amaze me, and the control system is still as intuitive as ever. I look forward to finishing the game, with sneak peaks at certain FAQs telling me Im pretty close to the end. I have refused to read anything about the plot though and am purely consulting the FAQ in my progression.

<p>Normally I hate the whole idea of FAQs and Game Guides, but to speed things up in time for <i>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</i>, Im giving myself just enough to get through the tough bits of <i>Metroid Prime</i> so as to still enjoy the game and not ruin the plot or story.

<p>Phazon Mines is kicking my ass at the moment and I love every minute of it. The look and feel of the Metroid universe has been recreated so well in 3D that its almost impossible to imagine it existing any other way. Of course, theres always <i>Super Metroid</i>, <i>Metroid Fusion</i>, and <i>Metroid: Zero Mission</i> to remind me why Metroid is such a beloved franchise.
