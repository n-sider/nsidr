<p>The latest in the "Reasoning Behind the Wii" interviews has been published online.   The series' intention is to explain the philosophy and technology that has gone into the development of the Wii console.  The latest is titled "Aiming for Worldwide Mii Communication."</p>

<p>The Mii application, which allows users to create digital representations of their face, will be included with every Wii console.  The idea was originally in development for the Nintendo DS.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, unaware of the idea's development, had expressed interest  to president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> about having an avatar-creator for Wii.   Iwata showed Miyamoto the DS prototype and the two agreed to develop it further.  After involving the expertise of Animal Crossing DS director <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=226">Hisashi Nogami</a>, it took the team about two months to refine.</p>

<p>One addition made to the software is called "Mii Parade."  This is a feature that utilizes the WiiConnect24 perpetual internet connection to allow your Mii characters to visit and inhabit other Wii consoles.  Likewise, your friend's Mii characters can visit your console.</p>
