<p>Yesterday we reported on the rumor, based on German online retailers' websites, that the DS Lite <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1769">might get an August 16 ship date</a> over in Europe.</p>

<p>GamesIndustry.biz doesn't think so.  While Nintendo remains mum on the date Lite becomes publicly available outside Japan, they've got in touch with a source in UK retail that says <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=14888">the Lite will be on shelves "sooner than that"</a> &mdash; characterizing the August 16 date as "way off".</p>

<p>Whatever the date, it's bound to be soon.  NOA VP of sales and marketing <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</a> has said he wants to see the classic DS phased out by August or September &mdash; they've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it if they want to meet <em>that</em> deadline.</p>
