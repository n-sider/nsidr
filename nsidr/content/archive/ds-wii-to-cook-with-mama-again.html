505 Games has announced that they will be publishing <i>Cooking Mama 2</i>, Office Create's sequel to the original Nintendo DS <i>Cooking Mama</i> as well as Wii's <i>Cooking Mama: Cook Off</i> in Europe.<br />
<br />
Cooking Mama 2 will feature similar gameplay to the original titles, adding new recipes, twice as many minigames, and as 505 Games puts it, "an all-new multiplayer mode"&mdash;presumably either different from Cook Off's multiplayer mode or simply ignorant of its existence.<br />
<br />
Both already-released Cooking Mama games have been rather successful in North America and Europe.  The new games are slated for an early 2008 release in Europe; presumably we'll be hearing soon from North American publisher Majesco about plans to publish the game stateside.
