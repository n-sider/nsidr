Nintendos flagship Nintendo World store opened its doors this past Saturday, May 14, in New York Citys famed Rockefeller Center.   The 10,000 square-foot store is packed with merchandise, display cases, and multiplayer gaming setups.  The first floor focuses on Nintendos mobile offerings with a Pokmon Center and over 18 Nintendo DS demo stations, while the second floor contains Nintendo apparel and Gamecube setups.

At 1PM, Nintendo launched its block party with speakers humming some remixed Nintendo classics and Donkey Konga melodies.  The emcee, set atop a 30-foot tower, riled up the crowd with Nintendo trivia and contest announcements.  The longest line formed for rare content in Pokmon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, which required a ticket given out only at this event. 

The Nintendo World space was previously a Pokmon Center.  It is located at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, right next to NBC studios.
