Nintendo has once again released a handful of numbers from the NPD Group in celebration of their April success, showing leads for Wii and Nintendo DS once again.  (Is this seriously news anymore?)<br />
<br />
Nintendo DS is once again way out in front, "projected"-ly moving 470,000 units.  The two best-selling games, beating out all other comers on all platforms, were&mdash;unsurprisingly&mdash;<i>Pok&eacute;mon Diamond</i> and <i>Pok&eacute;mon Pearl</i>, moving 1.75 million units combined in 14 days.  NOA president Reggie Fils-Aime expects the Pok&eacute;mon success to carry over to Wii, with its appeal expanding "even further with the introduction of <i>Pok√©mon Battle Revolution</i> to our Wii home console next month."<br />
<br />
Speaking of Wii, it beat out all other comers on the console front, with 360,000 units sold, bringing installed base to 2.5 million in the less-than-six-months since launch.  <i>Super Paper Mario</i> and <i>Wii Play</i> took spots 3 and 4 on the charts, trailing the Pok&eacute;mon games.
