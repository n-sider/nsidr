During their Q3 2006 conference call yesterday, Activision Publishing president and CEO Mike Griffith made <a href="http://www.thetanooki.com/2007/02/08/breaking-guitar-hero-comes-to-the-wii/">a curious comment</a> indicating that Wii may well see an installment in the Guitar Hero franchise in 2008.<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Activision Publishing President/CEO Mike Griffith</span>The key difference in our strategy versus the prior cycle, is that in addition to full support on Sony and Microsoft platforms, we will aggressively target the Nintendo platforms consistent with our multi-platform strategy and Nintendo's expected growth. In fiscal 2008, we will double our offerings on the DS and the Wii, including Spider-Man, Shrek, Transformers, and Guitar Hero.</div></div><br />
Activision previously made <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2450">rumblings</a> that Guitar Hero was headed for "every significant new format", which after E3 seemed to suggest Wii was a possibility&mdash;but Wii was curiously absent from new platform announcements.  While this does not exactly constitute an announcement, it seems either a Wii installment is in the works, or Griffith made a bit of a slip-up.<br />
