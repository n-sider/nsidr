Yuke's Company of America has announced that it will be bringing puzzle game <i>Neves</i> to the U.S. this coming November.<br />
<br />
Neves is based on the classic Japanese game Hayanama's Lucky Puzzle.  Your job as player is to assemble seven shapes to match the silhouette given.  (We have <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=5724&view=screens">11 new screenshots</a> to illustrate.)  The title has 500 different puzzles, a trophy room for boasting about your victories, four different game modes (Silhouettes, 7 Steps, Time, and Pressure) and also supports Versus with DS Download Play.<br />
<br />
Yuke's expects the game to get an E rating, though nothing has yet been handed down by the ESRB.
