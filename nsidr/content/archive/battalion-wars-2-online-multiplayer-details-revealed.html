<p>Word from <a href="http://www.britishgaming.co.uk/?p=1156">BritishGaming</a> says the new Battalion Wars for Wii will feature a multiplayer as well as online mode.  Three online multiplayer modes have been announced including Assault: Instant Combat, Skirmish: Tactical Depth, and Co-Op: Work with Friends.</p>

<p>Combat in the game will take place on land, sea and air with five new naval units including Battleships, Frigates, Submarines, Dreadnoughts, and Transports.  In multiplayer, players will have the ability to capture facility buildings in order to re-spawn units and use "Map Screen Commanding" to give them orders from afar.</p>

<p>The game will include over 20 single player missions and over 15 multiplayer missions.  Furthermore, players can utilize six different races within five unique environments.</p>

<p>More as we hear it...</p>
