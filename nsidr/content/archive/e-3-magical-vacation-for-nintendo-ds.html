<p><ul>
<li>The students of Will O' Wisp magical academy have a little problem: Their teacher has
mysteriously disappeared. After commandeering a handful of rockets to rescue her,
they've wound up on a strange (and sometimes scary) adventure through outer space.
Now players must rescue both their classmates AND their teacher - and just maybe the
whole solar system while they're at it.
<li>Explore strange planets. Players see the sights of this strange, sci-fi fantasy setting
as they uncover the secret behind their teacher's disappearance in this epic roleplaying
game.
<li>The stylus controls everything, from combat to conversations to outfitting allies.
Simple controls make it easy to play but a challenge to master.
<li>Players can link up wirelessly with five friends and explore the amigo dungeon
together - they'll find unending challenges and incredible rewards as they delve
into the depths of this unique multiplayer experience.
<li>Game storyline: Madeleine, a respected and powerful teacher at Will O' Wisp magical
academy, tells her students that she will undertake a dangerous mission in space and
trains them for combat should the need arise. After not hearing from her for some time,
the kids stumble upon a hangar of rocket ships. One by one, they board individual ships
and crash-land on distant planets alone. The player hops from planet to planet assembling
the group of classmates. Once together, they learn of an evil sorcerer - a former student
of the academy who now has ambitions to destroy reality - and set out to stop him.
Characters: Players can choose between a male or female human character. The students
in the academy make up the rest of their party. Each student specializes in a different
kind of magic.
<li>How to progress through the game: In Magical Vacation, players begin their quests as
students at a magical academy. As they progress through the game, they will travel to
new lands and cities, fight monsters to earn experience points and buy weapons, armor
and items from shops. Characters will gain levels and power as they earn more and more
experience points. Later in the game, players become free to wander and explore the
world.
<li>Multiplayer amigo dungeon and tag mode extend game play by giving players a unique
"amigo" dungeon they can explore with a total of six people. Additionally, tag mode
allows players to exchange data with one another and grow unique "egg" characters that
slowly grow and hatch over time.
<li>Special powers/weapons/moves/features: The game's combat plays like a traditional
role-playing game. The difference comes from the command wheel and the stylus
interface. Players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target.
<li>The game focuses on magic attacks: Each character has a "sign" linked to one of the
planets that determines the type of magic he or she uses. As the planets move through the
solar system, the effectiveness of magic spells shifts, requiring an ever-changing battle
plan: Monsters and characters grow stronger as their planets shift into prominence and
weaker as they move out of those positions. Players can check the planets positions by
tapping on the astrolog.
<li>Characters can occupy two battle "ranks." From the front rank, they can attack individual
enemies physically or with magic. From the back, they can attack groups of enemies with
magic, but they cannot use physical attacks.
