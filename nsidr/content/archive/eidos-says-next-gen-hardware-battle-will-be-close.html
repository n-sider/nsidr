<p>Eidos product acquisition director Ian Livingstone believes next-generation hardware sales will be much more evenly split between Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.  In an interview with <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=18952">GamesIndustry.biz</a> he said, "It's going to be a much closer race and significantly, I think Nintendo, with the Wii console, is going to be right back up in the thick of it."</p>

<p>Livingstone praises the unique gameplay-focused direction Nintendo is taking with Wii and notes, "It's quite interesting that they've decided not to go head-to-head with Microsoft and Sony, with the high quality interactive cinematic action adventure games; they've gone for gameplay over graphics instead. I think that's quite an interesting move and it could be very successful for them."

<p>He believes Wii removes a massive weight from the shoulders of developers. "To be able to create games that are based on gameplay rather than these intensive graphical productions, is a great opportunity for everybody," he suggested.</p>

<p>Still, Livingstone admits that no one truly knows who will win the next-generation hardware battle.  However, he's comforted by the fact that Eidos is in an ideal position to release games for and profit from all platforms.</p>
