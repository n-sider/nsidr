<h4>October 10th, 2000</h4>

<p>I have one question.
Is it true that the goldeneye team at rare is curently working or is
interesting to develop for the ps2 ox x-box.
I've heard of a game Timesplitter or something like that.
Thanks for the answer. By the way your site is very good.

<p>P.S.: Scuse my poor english, I speak french and I'm from Canada.

<p>Dagobert41@hotmail.com

<p><b>Pete: Well the team you're speaking of is Free Radical. They're made up of a few ex-GoldenEye staffers from Rare. They have developed Time Splitters for the PS2, and it will be published by Eidos. Given the fact that Eidos has stated they'll support NGC fully, it's possible you'll see this game (or Time Splitters 2) by the time the NGC launches in the US.</b>

<p>Hey, love the site. I've not heard anyone in the media comment AT ALL on the strikingly different silver controller cords. They look freakin' AWESOME! Is there any insight as to why Nintendo's going with these silver-like cords (I know it's actually clear plastic with braided nylon underneath)?

<p>- Aesop

<p><b>Pete: Those transparent cords are quite striking, aren't they? The only reason I can think of that Nintendo went that route instead of opting for regular black cords is for cosmetic purposes. They look cool, but I would guess they're simply there for the look. Don't expect anything special out of the cords aside from that-- they are after all just cords.</b>

<p>i was just at famitsu just watching the pictures cause i really don't 
understand nothing but i entered something like ...B"CEATEC",,"Combined 
Exhibition of Advanced Technologies-Providing Image,Information and 
Communication", and then i got into something about bluetooth technology 
something i don't really know what it is, but later i remembered than that 
is going to be used on the panasonic new handheld system and I THINK I SAW A 
PICTURE OF THE PANASONIC NEW HANDHELD AND IT LOOKS GREAT! . I can't be sure 
it really is but certainly looks like, so i send you the adress and the 
picture so you can answer my question, is this really the new handheld from 
panasonic?

<p><b>Pete: Well, N-Sider has the translated (the first part) of that Famitsu article <a href="/news/100900panasonic.shtml">here</a>. Personally I'm beginning to think the Panasonic handheld might be more along the lines of a Palm PC rather than a strict game machine. However it is interesting to see the various uses of Bluetooth technology since Nintendo has already stated they're experimenting with it.</b>

<p>Hello,

<p>What is the clock frequency of the Game Boy Advance, I can't find it anywhere.

<p>Regards,

<p>-Emmanuel Giard 

<p><b>Pete: <a href="http://pocket.ign.com">Pocket IGN</a> states the GBA has a 16mhz 32bit RISC-CPU + 8bit CISC-CPU.</b>

<p>Hey guys, nice to see n-sider going strong.  For those who haven't checked it out already, head to the forums to participate in some great topics.  Anyways on to the question:
   
<p>I was just thinking the other day about how lazy I am and how I love my remote.  The remote is our way of being the pinnacle of laziness.  Now the only thing I find anoying (well not really but still...) is that I have to physically move my legs and body towards my n64 to turn it on.  I mean...Come on!   I'm too lazy to hit the power switch so I was wondering if it would be possible to have a "power" button on the Wavebird controller.  My television has one, and my reciever has one so I figure why can't my NGC?  Please give me insight on this and maybe even tips on how to be lazy like constructing a machine to hit the power button FOR me.  Peace 

<p>generaltao 

<p>p.s.  I am not actually this lazy, but I was just wondering for the sake of comedy :)

<p><b>Pete: Good question, Gen. Of course the problem with that might be, if you can turn your system on via the Wavebird, you might be able to accidentally turn it off (which would be very bad). That's why I would think a power button would be a bad idea, because in the heat of a Perfect Dark 2 multiplayer session, someone might accidentally hit the power button. However, maybe some button combination when the game is paused or the system is shut off would work well.</b>

<p>The Nintendo Gamecube(NGC) will be the best video game console ever. I just 
have one question: will the handle on the back be able to come off? Some 
people(like me) never have to move it anywhere.

<p>Also, How many games are expected to be released with the GAMECUBE?

<p>-TommyD.

<p><b>Pete: My gut feeling is NOA will remove the handle for the US release of NGC. That is unless the Gamecube is meant to be portable in some fashion that Nintendo isn't revealing just yet. As for games, I would expect the NGC to launch with at least 2 or 3 in-house Nintendo titles this time around, and another 3-5 2nd and 3rd party titles. The US launch, of course, should be huge, you could see upwards of 10-15 games ready by October 2001, depending on developer support.</b>

<p>Hey, great site. Enough with flattery, Are there any RPG elements in any
confirmed games for GC?  Are there any RPGs confirmed for it? Are there
any RPG rumors? Is Nintendo trying to get andy RPG companies? Have any
expressed intrest in the GC? And finally, has Nintendo changed its views
about RPGs? Are RPGs a definite possibility for the GC?
peace out

<p>-DiaTasU

<p><b>Pete: Well, Nintendo will claim that they haven't shown any "confirmed" games, but of the demos shown at Space World, Silicon Knights' <i><a href="../previews/toohuman091100.shtml">Too Human</a></i> most definitely has RPG elements. Expect a lot more RPGs on the NGC, and believe that Nintendo will make sure the system has ample RPGs (look at the GBA, for instance, it's already swarming with RPG and strategy RPG titles). Shigeru Miyamoto even mentioned he'd demonstrate the Gamecube to major RPG makers personally, and he was confident they'd support NGC. That's good enough for me.</b>

<p>Why is Nintendo being so secret, can't it just show us
a football game or something. I mean no one will be
able to steal their precious idea because its only a
football game. All I want to see is an actual game
running on the NGC and show it off to my sony-loving
friends at school(there is alot of them). Those demos
shown at Spaceworld were great but these sony freaks
need more than demos for them to admit that the
playstation2 is below the mighty GAMECUBE.

<p>-safechae

<p><b>Pete: Patience, my friend, patience. Obviously Nintendo kept quiet on things like football games because a Japanese trade show such as Space World wouldn't be the proper place to show an NFL title. Also, Retro Studios, who is apparently developing Nintendo's in-house football game hasn't had full NGC kits for too long. I think Nintendo will wait until most of their games are at a playable state before showing them. And that should be around...oh May 2001.</b>
