<p>During a meeting with analysts and reporters, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company's new strategy is to offer a different video game experience than its rivals to attract casual gamers, according to Reuters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">"What we are looking for is not next-generation technology, but next-generation game play," said Iwata.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iwata said that providing only improved technology will cater to the hardcore and alienate casual players.  Iwata said he hopes this new strategy will significantly boost the company's 2005-2006 earnings.</p>

<p>Iwata said Nintendo plans to release <i>Mario Party 6</i> for GameCube later this year and that the game can be played without a controller. 

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">"In the past, there have been people who have felt controllers are hard to deal with and did not play games, but this (game) will seek to appeal to those people," said Iwata.</font></p>

<p>It's not known if this is in relation to the recent <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=day&date=2004-06-01#327">trademark and peripheral registrations</a>, however we'll be sure to keep you up to date on any news.</p>
