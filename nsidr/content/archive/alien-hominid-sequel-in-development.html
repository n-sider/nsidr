The Behemoth said it will develop a multi-platform sequel to <i>Alien Hominid</i>, according to Nintendojo.com.  Alien Hominid started as an online Flash game and the studio hopes to expand the gameplay to a four-player co-op adventure. Nintendojo was told the game will feature sidescrolling brawling action much like Golden Axe and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The next <i>Alien Hominid</i> game is expected to release in 2006.
