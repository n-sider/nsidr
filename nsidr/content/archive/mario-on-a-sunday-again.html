<p>Ladies and gentlemen, (re-)start your speculators.  Nintendo has launched <a href="http://mario.nintendo.com/">the teaser site</a> for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876">New Super Mario Bros.</a>, and there they've got the game pegged for a May 21 release.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1764">Once again</a>, on a Sunday.</p>

<p>This once again fuels speculation that Nintendo intends to release the title, widely anticipated as one of the DS's killer titles, alongside the upcoming <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS lite</a>.  The reason: Nintendo almost never releases games on Sundays.  The most notable time they did that in recent memory was when <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=878"><i>Super Mario 64 DS</i></a> released alongside the original Nintendo DS.</P>

<p>So, once again, we'll simply have to see where this goes.  At the very least, we do know that Nintendo currently intends to release at least the game on the 21st.</p>
