<p>The co-developer of Blizzard's <i>StarCraft: Ghost</i> is no longer involved in the title's development, according to <a href="http://www.homelanfed.com/index.php?id=24150">HomeLAN</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><font size="2">"Nihilistic has completed its contribution on StarCraft: Ghost," a Nihilistic spokesperson told HomeLAN.  "They are contracted to begin work on another project in the months ahead. Due to the requirements of that obligation and the delay of StarCraft, it was mutually determined that now would be the best time for them to complete their work."</font></p></blockquote>

<p>Last week, Blizzard officially announced the delay of <i>StarCraft: Ghost</i> into 2005 noting the time would be used to further polish the game.</p>
