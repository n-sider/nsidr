<p>Buena Vista Games is saying today that they intend to publish touch-screen puzzler <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=994">Meteos</a></cite> with a twist: as <cite>Meteos: Disney Edition</cite>.</p>

<p>This isn't just for Japan, either &mdash; in fact, a publisher has not yet been lined up for Asian territories &mdash; Buena Vista intends to publish the game in all territories.  No word on whether the gameplay is actually changed: all Buena Vista is saying is that it will feature Disney characters.</p>

<p><cite>Meteos: Disney Edition</cite> is currently headed for stores in fall of this year.</p>
