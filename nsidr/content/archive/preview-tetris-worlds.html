<h3>Tetris Worlds</h3>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/tetrisworlds01.jpg" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="right" width="185" height="120"><i>Tetris</i>, the game franchise that refuses to go away, the game franchise that has made a cameo on nearly any type of computer, video game, and electronic handheld apparatus. Therefore, the announcement of <i>Tetris Worlds</i> should have surprised no one. In fact, the fact it took so long to announce should have been the only thing you didn't expect. Publisher THQ and <i>Tetris</i> license distributor and developer Blue Planet Software have decided to work together to bring a new "advanced" edition of <i>Tetris</i> to the Game Boy Advance.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/tetrisworlds02.jpg" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="left" width="190" height="120"><i>Tetris Worlds</i> will not deviate from the formula, and will play like every standard <i>Tetris</i> before it. The game will obviously feature pretty graphics and a catchy set of tunes, but the most important addition is the game supporting four-players simultaneously via the communication link. The game will also feature a few new game modes, and seven worlds which you will travel through on your quest to eliminate lines.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/tetrisworlds03.jpg" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="right" width="185" height="120">THQ is guaranteed a big hit if Nintendo's sales of <i>Tetris</i> and <i>Tetris DX</i> are any indication. THQ plans to have the game released as early as August and no later than September 2001.</p>
