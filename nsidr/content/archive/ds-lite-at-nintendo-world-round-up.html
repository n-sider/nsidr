<p>Nintendo's lighter and brighter <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> handheld <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2218">went on sale at midnight</a> this past June 11 at <a href="http://www.nintendoworldstore.com/">the Nintendo World Store</a>.  Though we weren't there, many other outlets did cover the event.</p>

<p>CBS News's Chad Chamberlain <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/11/tech/gamecore/main1699519.shtml">was there</a>.  He saw a teenage boy named Julian dressed in a homemade Link costume, and another man who had left a wedding party early to get in line.  Engadget also <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/06/11/nintendos-ds-lite-launch-party-in-new-york/">took lots of pictures</a>, including the particularly odd sight of people who already owned DS Lites standing in line to get... another one.  They reported the line didn't actually open until after 12:20 a.m.</p>

<p>Nintendo also sent along some pictures of the event, which follow.</p>
