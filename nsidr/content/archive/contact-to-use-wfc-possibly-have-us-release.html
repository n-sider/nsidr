<p>Upcoming Nintendo DS RPG <a href="http://www.mmv-i.net/game/ds/contact/home.html">Contact</a>, slated for a March 30 release in Japan by Marvelous and Grasshopper, will use the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for purposes yet unknown, given the presence of the WFC logo on the game's website.</p>

<p>Contact is a unique-looking RPG being produced by Killer 7 producer/director Suda 51, where a professor crash-lands on an alien planet and enlists the assistance of a local boy named Cherry to escape.  The professor lives on one screen while Cherry plays out the game on the other.</p>

<p>Also of note, <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/01/03/contacts-online-compatible/">according to 4CR</a>, is that the game may see a stateside release, according to Q&A from the game's creators.  We'll keep you posted if we find anything out on this front.</p>
