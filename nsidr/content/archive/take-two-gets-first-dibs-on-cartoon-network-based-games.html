<p>Take-Two has announced that an agreement with Cartoon Network has been signed, giving Take-Two first dibs on the rights to publish and develop games based on Cartoon Network properties. Given this opportunity, the company has already announced plans to develop a game entitled <i>Codename: Kid's Next Door</i>. Development of the upcoming games will be handled by Take-Two Licensing, a subsidiary created after the company's purchase of TDK Mediactive.

<p><i>"Both Cartoon Network and Take-Two have been successful in creating worldwide entertainment brands,"</i><b> said John Friend, senior vice president of Cartoon Network Enterprises, Cartoon Network's licensing division.</b> <i>"This partnership will harness the strengths of both companies to build on existing brands and create new ones. Ultimately, we hope to see the simultaneous launch of a new series with a multi-platform video game."</i>
