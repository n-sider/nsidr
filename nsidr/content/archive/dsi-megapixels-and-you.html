It's not supposed to be good form to call out one's readers&#8212;though I am not entirely sure if the people I am calling out here are, in fact, that same group&#8212;but I am getting <i>really</i> irritated with a highly predictable trend in any discussion involving Nintendo's up-and-coming DSi: complaining about the camera.<br />
<br />
In case you are lucky enough to not have been in any forum threads about the DSi, you might have missed it, but there are a very vocal group of people who are <i>really ticked off</i> that the DSi's camera is a VGA-resolution job.  It had its unfortunate genesis in a liveblog gaffe that claimed the thing was 3 megapixels instead of 0.3.  This has since been corrected, but the complaints have continued unabated.<br />

This attitude confuses the heck out of me.  These people are effectively complaining that they can't use the $170 DSi&#8212;which also goes online, downloads games, and is actually a pretty substantial upgrade all-around over the old DS that will eventually see its own library come into being <i>in addition to</i> playing the DS's awesome existing library&#8212;as a substitute for a much more substantial imaging device.  The usual refrain I hear is that you can get a much better camera in a cell phone these days, but come on.  I'm usually impressed when any cell phone camera picture looks good in the first place, no matter what resolution.<br />
<br />
The DSi's camera is there to support the sotware.  Yes, you can take still photos with it, but they're for the diary software that comes with it or the photo-manipulation toy&#8212;not for framing on your wall.  Would you ask your family to pose in front of an EyeToy at Christmas-time to take your keepsake photo?  No?<br />
<br />
Then how can you <i>possibly</i> expect that from the DSi?
