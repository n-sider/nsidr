<p>Satoru Iwata, president of Nintendo, is scheduled to speak for an hour at this year's Tokyo Game Show, in Japan. Speculation is that Iwata may use this high-profile event to announce more details regarding the Nintendo Revolution.</p>

<p>The last time Iwata spoke at the TGS was back in 2003. His topic for this year is expected to be on the perils of modern gaming complexity and what Nintendo's strategy is to help the Japanese video game industry.</p>

<p>The TGS takes place September 16-18 at the Makuhari Messe convention center, near Tokyo. Iwata will be speaking on the 17th at 11:00 AM.</p>
