<i>Column by <a href="staffview.php?staffid=10">Jeff Van Camp</a>, <a href="staffview.php?staffid=6">Dean Bergmann</a></i>

<p><b>Edition: 05-16-2005</b>

<p>Two minds...one site. Two motives...one goal. Two editors...one conversation. You have now entered a dimension unlike any other. This is <b>N-Banter</b>.

<p>In this edition, I (Jeff) chat it up with longtime staffer, Dean Bergmann. E3 2005 was the topic of interest: the pre-shows, Zelda, and everything in-between. Enjoy. 

<p><hr>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>E3's less than a day away. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Yup.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>What are you looking forward to most?

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Seriously? The press conferences, they're the most fun - last year at Nintendo's especially, with the new Zelda unveiling.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha, yeah. It always seems like 90% of the breaking news we get is during the pre-shows.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Now if only we could perfect getting stuff up before everyone else :-)

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>True.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>This year was truly a pain though, I don't want to badmouth anyone, but everyone was so 'anal' (for lack of a better word) about letting a non-Xbox/PS2 site into their media briefing.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah, I noticed that. You'd think, especially with Microsoft, that they'd want all the coverage they can get, since it wants to launch the Xbox 360 so soon from now.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Well, as I mentioned above, I've attended three past E3s, and we've never had an issue, from Microsoft Or Nintendo (this is our first year going to Sony's) -- but this year was just a battle of wit.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah, its difficult. We just wanted to have kind of a balanced view of the pre-shows. Just because we are into Nintendo doesn't mean we or our readers aren't interested in breaking news from the competition. I'm more excited about <i>Perfect Dark Zero</i> than anybody. <i>Perfect Dark</i> is one of my favorite games. I hope they have some classic <i>GoldenEye 007</i> maps in there as well.


<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>See, I love(d) Rare, I'm anticipating <i>Conker: Live and Reloaded</i> the most, but <i>PD0</i> really turns me off, hopefully they've completely removed the toon-style. I mean, it worked for <i>Zelda: Wind Waker</i>, but as a futuristic shooter. I dunno, <i>Killer 7</i> already took care of that.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I can't wait for <i>Conker</i>. I kind of missed it on the N64, but it should be great on the Xbox. Cool looking multiplayer too. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>It was the last game I bought on the N64, I hope they sneak some Nintendo-esque references.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I just (like two seconds ago) got this email from Nintendo: 

<p><i>Don't forget to bring your Nintendo DS(TM) system to the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles next week. The massive Nintendo booth will feature an area dedicated to DS Download Play. Visitors can try out sample versions of Nintendo games delivered wirelessly, video content - and a few surprises. Be sure to check it out.</i>

<p>Should be interesting. I plan to bring my DS to the press conference. Ill try to hop into their game.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Wow. Now that's neat. I really hope Nintendo takes that idea further and allows people download demos off the web and whatnot -- In stores and everything. It could really be an awesome way to get some lesser known titles out there.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I'm really anticipating the DS network if anyone can do it Nintendo can - they've been researching since the 80s. If anything, this download system will alleviate the long DS lines.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Recently, I heard a rumor that Nintendo might only allow people to play with other gamers (over the internet) that they've met in real life. It sounded kind of weird to me. I think there should definitely be an emphasis on playing people you know, but without limitations like that. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I've not heard anything about that. That sounds a lot like that Demasked thing we ran last month, Nintendo's partnered with GameSpy, Im sure you'll see a lot of integration that way... I doubt they'd limit it like that. Besides, there would have to be one hell of a firmware upgrade for the DS to account for all that info.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Let me find a link It was an IGN story (obviously). <a href=http://cube.ign.com/articles/611/611909p1.html>http://cube.ign.com/articles/611/611909p1.html</a>.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>See, if they actually did that, then it'd kind of defeat the purpose of Online, because most people would only know other DS user's 'personally' locally, It's almost a moot point.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Exactly. Anyway, back to E3. I guess I'm most excited about the Revolution and online stuff, but really <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Geist</i>, <i>Advance Wars: Under Fire</i>, and a few DS games like <i>Nintendogs</i> have me most excited. I'm ready for the next generation, but it feels a little soon.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I think this is one of the first E3's I'm heading into not knowing what to expect from Nintendo, other than Zelda of course. How much revolution will be there? Especially with Microsoft's 360 and Sony's PS3, I don't know what to expect. I love and hate Nintendo for being so quiet.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Was it last year when Nintendo basically revealed everything before the show? I think that was 2003.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Yeah, for the most part, except for <i>Zelda</i> of course. We knew the DS stuff, we knew a lot of it, <i>Zelda</i> was the big surprise - we knew it'd be there, but not how it would look. The last two years have been like that though. 2003 was disappointing all around though, the middle years between console generations are usually crap.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b><i>Zelda</i> took me for a shocker last year.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Well, if you would have seen Cory [Faller]'s face, he was almost crying. We all were.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha!

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Its one thing to read about it, but to be there, being the first to see it, it's something else. The entire auditorium blew up in OH MY GOD.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I was almost crying too too. But in a lame sort of way, back here on my computer.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I hope this year has something like that. If you've seen the DVD, you can clearly hear my excitement. I'm going to be covering the DS network extensively, but other than that, I don't know what else to expect.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Awesome. But yeah, I'm pretty interested to see what the videos Nintendo shows for the Revolution will look like. They almost can't really show a Zelda video without detracting from the current game. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>If they do decide to promote Revolution heavily this year, I wonder if it will be anything like the GameCube in 2001, they very heavily played the 'dolphin' aspect of it, having live fountains and bubble walls guarding the entrance to the booth, it was something amazing, especially for my first year.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I hope they reveal a real name. They get so hardcore into these codenames.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I've heard so many rumors of playable revolution, I know that's a pipe dream, but if Microsoft and Sony has it, Nintendo will be seen as behind, again.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>See, I don't think PS3 will be playable at all. Sony didnt' even have PSP playable last year, did it?

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Haha, they had the hardware connected to computers streaming videos onto the screen. Well, my theory is, since the Revolutions chips are called Broadway and Hollywood, Im thinking they'll go back to the "Entertainment System" convention, I hope.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Exactly. Sony thinks they are impenetrable. I dont remember, so it might not put much effort into it. I'm kind of skeptical about the whole Xbox 360 being white. People love to compare it to the iPod (dumbest comparison ever), but I just think it's kind of ugly.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Agreed! That controller is hideous. It's like a Microsoft wingman painted white. I think they're trying too hard to capitalize on the PS2/iPod thing. White and standing up, hmm, we've seen that before.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha, indeed. I also still think it should be called Xbox 2 or at least a name that makes sense. If white is the new black, someone please give me silver.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I think Microsoft made a huge mistake with the MTV thing. They pretty much locked themselves into the design.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The iPod is cool because nothing looks like it and it's elegant. I don't think trying to copy that design really works with a home console.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>The new logo is basically a metallic ball with the X logo in it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The Okama GameSphere

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Hahahaha.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Someone NEEDS to name their next system the GameSphere. Its just too funny to pass up. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I'm still betting on something along the lines of Entertainment System. The Hollywood/Broadway screams it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I guess I'm seeing the same problems with the industry that Nintendo is. Team sizes, development costs, and development time are all ballooning. Microsoft is doing a little to slow the dangerous cycle, but Sony seems content to make it even worse. I really related to the speech by Mr. Iwata at the GDC. I hope they have a similarly exciting presence at E3.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Especially with Mr. Gates' comments about Nintendo becoming niche  niche in what sense? That they're all about gaming? Sony and Microsoft are playing thumb wars too much with each other to realize what's going on in the industry. And I think Sony is making the same mistake Nintendo did back in the SNES days, and you'll easily see Microsoft rise up a bit, divide Sonys market in half. Hopefully Nintendo can regain some ground, if it starts making the right decisions.

<p>Then there's EA, being the bully / evil step sister just buying up everything in sight, laughing all the way to the bank. I think whoever gets a grip on EA will become dominant, it's that easy.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b> MS and Sony are going for the same exact audience with the exact same techniques and the exact same type and variety of games. Sony is arrogant, just like Nintendo was around the launch of the N64. I think they are very vulnerable with the PSP being where it's at and the start of a new generation (financially as well). As for EA, most of its games are just too formulaic for my tastes, with the exception of a few games like <i>Burnout 3</i> and Maxis titles.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Speaking of financially, have you read that they're up for takeover action soon? Theoretically, Microsoft could buy Sony.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Microsoft buying Sony? Come on.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Why not, if you cant beat em, buy em. That's what they tried to do with Rare, and look how that turned out. They really got "Grabbed by the Ghoulies" on that one, ha ha ha.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Dean, youre a loser. lol. They can beat them. At least that's what they think. I believe they can too. They're much more organized with their online network and all of that. Sony is kind of a mess.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>It'll be interesting to see the respective Online networks shape up... Live2 is sounding cool, Nintendo Online is coming together, and Sony, well, who knows. I'm just going into this year objectively, I want to see everyone, see what cards are out there, and see who's making mistakes and who isnt, which is why I'm glad we've got coverage of all three press conferences. It'll be an amazing time.

We havent talked much about Nintendo, but I can see them doing something big -- Reggie started the Revolution, perhaps he can clarify it a bit more and put it back on track, you know? So much wild speculation is going around about gyros and touch screens; it's all becoming a hype train mess. I think the biggest highlight for us last year was in the media center, seeing the massive Reggielution stuff.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Well what you don't understand this, we had no clue it was going on until the last day of the show. We were in our staff chats and people talked about it, and we were clueless - we finally saw the pictures on the last day and didnt know it had been on the internet for the last week, it was hilarious.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah it kind of took off pretty quick. I think people elevate Reggie a little too high, but he is an interesting guy to listen to.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I agree he's a bit on a pedestal, but he's got the right motivation. We just need more people who can make decisions that are like him. He can talk the talk, but walking the walk for Nintendo, is another ballgame - especially with the Japanese control. I'd love to see NoA [Nintendo of America] have more control, and I think it may finally be happening, especially with the DS launching in North American first, it was a true shift of wind.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>He wanted to turn <i>Electroplankton</i> into a rap game. That's not a great idea. Lol. But yeah, I agree. NoA hasn't had the amount of control and influence it needs.

<p>Anyway, trying to get back on track here, of the GameCube games besides Zelda, what are you looking forward too?

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Mario, if it makes an appearance. Other than that, truthfully, not a lot - I'm a huge next-gen advocate, and for right now, that means the DS, I'm heavily anticipating <i>Animal Crossing DS</i> and <i>Mario Kart DS</i>. Well, and <i>DDR with Mario</i> -- but that's another story ;-)

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b><i>Animal Crossing</i> looks great, but I'm hoping there will be new stuff besides just online play. It's kind of the same situation Harvest Moon is in. They need to take both series to a new level.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I think <i>AC</i> will have more, if they give the user's more control - like a crude modeling system. If you can model your own objects, color them and stuff, and share those online, it's personal.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>That would be cool. But I doubt theyll add that.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I'd love the ability to steal stuff too, like if you forget to lock your house, or something.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The ability to play <i>Balloon Fight</i> online would be really cool. And yeah, being able to steal would be awesome.
 
<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Well that was my main qualm with the first one, you could freely walk into the other houses, but you couldnt do jack all with anything inside. No interaction, nothing. What if you stole your neighbors bed? Theyd come and bitch at you for it and piss on your house. But the more I think about it, the more it will never happen - because it's a kids game at heart, Nintendo cant promote thievery.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yes they can. They are promoting locking your house! Besides they got away with slavery when they made Pokmon.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Aha! Excellent.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>In the original Animal Crossing you could steal stuff on GBA island. A commons area for each village perhaps, or the ability to put furniture outside if youd like.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>You know what I really want? I have to find someone who has this power, but, <i>Mario Paint DS</i>. The stylus is perfect for it, I need to track down Miyamoto, or some Nintendo guy. That's my main goal this year, finding someone important and telling them.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>That would be awesome and so natural too. I bet something like that is already in development.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Well, there was a hint of it in <i>Wario Ware</i>, with Wario Paint. I loved the music maker in the original, it was great. It upsets me that <i>Jam with the Band</i> [AKA <i>Band Brothers</i>] never saw a US release.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Tell me about it. Nintendo should be heavily promoting all of these unique titles if they hope to get people to go along with their philosophies.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>It's the artistic ones that I love, <i>Jam with the Band</i> was my biggest want over here, because it's so insanely simple and unique, but Nintendo never does it. It had a great concept. Just because it didnt do well in Japan doesnt mean it would bomb here and, even so, I am sad.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>A lot of times even quirky games sell more here than in Japan.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Look at <i>Polarium</i>, highly addictive. I got my copy and loved it so much I got one for my girlfriend.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I wonder how that's selling. I have yet to play it, but it looks fun. It reminds me a lot of Tetris.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>It's addictive, over anything. Hopefully next week there will be some more interesting DS games coming our way, get the system on the right track, ya know?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>When do you think the Revolution will hit shelves?

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Man, who knows -- I think it all relies on Sony, Nintendo wont say anything but will launch it like, the day before the PS3.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Check this out: <a href= http://cube.ign.com/articles/611/611577p1.html >http://cube.ign.com/articles/611/611577p1.html</a>. Hints that the Revolution might hit shelves around Mid 2006. <i>"Secondly, today's news suggests that Revolution will ship well after Sony's PlayStation 3, which is rumored for a first quarter 2006 debut."</i> There is no way the PS3 will hit shelves before late 2006.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I agree about Sony and the PS3. Its been plagued with issues. But I still think it's up to Sony to decide the new gen. Microsoft is pulling the Sega card.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah but there is no reliable data to suggest launching a year ahead of the other two systems will help or hurt the Xbox 360. Genesis launched first and did fine. The Dreamcast and Saturn didn't do so well. However, the original PlayStation hit shelves far before the N64 and did very well, as did the PlayStation 2. It's all in how you use your extra year. Don't pull a Sega and be an idiot is the general idea.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Times are different now though. The Genesis, Dreamcast, Saturn, all had huge graphical advantages. I agree about Sony and the PS3. Its been plagued with issues. PS1 over the SNES, it was huge. This time, not so much. The Xbox is finally getting great looking games, and boom, they release a new one to start over again.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Very true. <i>Doom III</i> looked pretty, I guess.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b><i>Doom III</i> was made of plastic.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>All id games are, as are most games built from an id engine. I think, if anything, we will see much more plastic next generation.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Heh, if Madden is any indication, I think we'll see a lot more video next generation ;-) They released that madden next gen video a few weeks ago all pre-rendered, but everyone blew their load on it anyway.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha. If you ask Cory what he wants most next generation he'll say "grass."

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Yeah, me too. It makes Zelda that much more fun.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I think it would be nice, but I'm looking for more than just grass to get me to buy a new system. Things are already looking pretty good.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Agreed -- not to rain on a parade though, I dont like the look of link in his non-tunic clothing, looks too much like the blocky characters in <i>FF7</i>. Huge forearms, little elbows.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The new Link?

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Yeah, in the new Zelda. Those shots of him on the horse, talking to villagers are just too <i>Fable</i>/early gen-ish. Ugh.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Oh, oh. Yeah he looks like a girl. Looks odd, that's for sure. But we'll get used to it. I'm more concerned about the look of the villagers themselves. They don't seem to have as much personality as those in older games. 

<p>Lets talk about controllers for a second though. What do you think of all the recent rumors about the Revolution's controller? Think Nintendo will show it?

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I hope so, Even if it's just a prototype form, it'd be nice to have an idea of what they're actually trying to do with it, ya know?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Oh I know, but showing it too early wouldn't be wise either.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>It all depends on how well Nintendo perceives its competition. If they're behind this time, there is no more hope for their 'popularity. If Sony and Microsoft show off designs and stuff and Nintendo twiddles its thumbswell, Ill personally be pissed.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Agreed. But it is still a year and a half until launch, so I don't think it would be wise to give away too much. MS has a year to develop an add-on if they wanted too.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Sony may not show the system playable, but it'll probably show the system itselfin a PowerPoint presentation :-)

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha. As usual. They are notorious for being long, drawn out, and filled with graphs.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>I dont envy Mark and Brandon [they are attending the Sony press conference].

<p>What are your thoughts on the two or three different 'models' of Xbox360 that are apparently going to launch? One with a small hard drive, one with a large (maybe one without). Maybe even one with a PC based platform or something similar.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I don't think people will pay over 300 bucks for a system (most people) and a hard drive is necessary with Xbox Live. So people are going to buy an Xbox that is useless online and have to buy another one if they want a hard drive -- kind of dumb. Add-ons don't really work though. They never have. Developers don't support add-ons because not everyone has them. Unless it's a very cheap hard drive, I don't see much success in that idea.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>It's all up in the air at this point, what will be successful and what won't. It's a gamble that someone will have to take and that someone seems to be Microsoft - they dont build on their past, they totally ignore what they've already done and try something different. Especially with no backwards compatibility; there will be some issues there.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>You dont think it will be backward compatible? I see backward compatibility as a must. Rushing out a console and then not including that is a big gamble.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Nope, I dont think they'll do it. 

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>But yeah, it should be a pretty interesting show this year. I'm more excited about it than I have been for quite some time.

<p><b><font color="blue">Dean: </font></b>Me too, definitely.
