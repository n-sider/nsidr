Disappointed with the <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> delay?  According to analysts at GamerMetrics, Capcom shouldn't be&#8212;the delay should be good news for <i>Zack & Wiki</i> and <i>Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles</i>.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>GamerMetrics finds Brawl players also interested in <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> as well as Zack and RE: UC</li>
  <li>Though Galaxy is still the most closely correlated title, Capcom's offerings follow close behind</li>
  <li>Zack should appeal to "the younger, casual segment" while RE aims for "older, more mature Nintendo enthusiasts"</li>
