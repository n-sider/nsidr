<p>Crafty Zelda fans have put together a <a href="http://www.4boxcomical.com/flashstuff/zelda.html">Pac-Man parody</a> with Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series.  Use the directional keys on your keyboard to navigate Link around a Zelda-themed map while dodging Gels and collecting pills.</p>  

<p>Designed by Namco's Toru Iwatani, Pac-Man started out in the arcades in 1980. It became incredibly popular throughout the United States and to this day is one of the most recognized video game characters.  Iwatani is said to have received inspiration from eating pizza, removing one slice to reveal the Pac-Man we now know.  In the game, players scurry around mazes eating white dots while being chased by ghosts.</p>
