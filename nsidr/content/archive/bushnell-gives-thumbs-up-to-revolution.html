<p>The man who brought us Pong and founded Atari, Nolan Bushnell, had considerable praise for Revolution's controller as well as Nintendo's overall strategy at the <a href="http://www.arc.ritsumei.ac.jp/DIEC2005/index-e.html">Digital Entertainment Conference 2005</a>.</p>

<blockquote>"The 3D controller that Nintendo is on to is a very good idea," [Bushnell] says. "If you look at todays controller with triangles, Xs, squares and circles, its scary. Its like a keyboard. People are interface phobic."</blockquote>

<p>Other highlights from Bushnell's commentary (though admittedly nothing else on Nintendo) can be found in <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/diec-2005/diec-ataris-founder-slams-sony-praises-nintendo-140629.php">Kotaku's coverage</a>.</p>
