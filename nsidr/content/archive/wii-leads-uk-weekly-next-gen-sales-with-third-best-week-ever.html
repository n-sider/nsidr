Thanks to Easter gift-buying and a bigger-than-usual shipment, Wii has managed to become the <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=24120">top-selling next-generation console</a> last week in the United Kingdom.<br />
<br />
Wii moved 25,000 units for the period, compared to 17,000 of Sony's PlayStation 3 and 11,000 of Microsoft's Xbox 360.  Speaking to the success, a Nintendo spokesperson told GamesIndustry.biz, "Last week was Wii's third biggest sales week since launch. Everything we are shipping, we are selling."  Speaking to the possibility that Wii shipment sizes might have had an impact, the spokesperson conceded, "Sales in previous weeks weren't as strong as 25k. More units are shipped some weeks than others."
