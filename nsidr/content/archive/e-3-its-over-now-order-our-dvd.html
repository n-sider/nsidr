<b>E3 2006 is Over, now experience the DVD!</b><br><br>
<p> E3 2006 came to a close a few minutes ago, and with that the halls are shut down, the games turn off, and everything goes back into the proverbial vault until each game is released, and all the new hardware finally comes out.</p><br>

<p>As you may have already known, N-Sider creates a DVD that chronicles the events of each year's show, with a unique perspective and personal twist, that makes you feel like you're actually there at the show. Not only seeing the games, how they're played, and the environment they are in; but also we include staff exchanges, stuff outside of the show that most other discs never show.</p><br>

<p> As we wrap up our filming, we can finally give you a concrete feature list of this year's disc, so that if you havent already preordered, you should do so now, by clicking the E3 banner just above this article. What you can expect on this year's disc:</p><br>
