<p>Former &mdash; apparently once-retired &mdash; Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=497">Minoru Arakawa</a> <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=11738">has joined up</a> with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1452">Henk Rogers</a> for one of Rogers' new ventures, Tetris Online Inc.  (It was previously announced this past October that Arakawa would sit on the board of directors of Rogers' Blue Lava Wireless.)</p>

<p>Tetris Online was formed, as Rogers puts it, to combat the problem of high prices and poor quality in mobile gaming.  "It's free junk and amazing stuff for ridiculous amounts of money," he said. "There's got to be a middle ground."</p>

<p>To that end, Tetris Online will sell &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; Tetris (which Rogers owns the rights to) as well as other games like poker.  Rogers is currently shooting for a monthly fee of $3 to let mobile users play his games.</p>
