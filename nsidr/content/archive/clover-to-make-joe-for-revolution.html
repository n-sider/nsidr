<p>Had enough of <i>Viewtiful Joe</i> for awhile?  According to a recent Jeux-France <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/articles_dossiers244_interview-viewtiful-joe.html">interview with Clover's Atsushi Inaba</a>, no, you haven't.  He's mulling over how Joe might make an appearance on Revolution.</p>

<p>1UP has a brief mention of <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147337">the relevant part of the interview</a> for us non-French-speakers.  "Now, if the character and the universe of Viewtiful Joe adapt correctly to the characteristics of Nintendo's future console, and we could indeed conceive a Viewtiful Joe on Nintendo Revolution, [we would do it]," Inaba says. "In the contrary case, we will try to make to propose another game on Nintendo Revolution which is as interesting."</p>

<p>Hopefully, Clover will stretch their legs a bit as they are currently doing with the intriguing <i>Okami</i> (for Sony's PlayStation 2), and produce a new franchise for the Revolution.</p>
