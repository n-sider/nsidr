<p>Nintendo UK general manager <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=991">David Yarnton</a> had <a href="http://www.mcvuk.com/newsitem.php?id=1039">some choice words</a> regarding Sony's PlayStation 3 controller announcement for MCV.</p>

<p>"I'd love to dig up some old Phil Harrison comments and say 'hang on a second &mdash; six months ago when we launched our controller you said one thing, and now why are you doing this?'" said Yarnton, referring to the Wii controller reveal at the Tokyo Games Show, over six months ago. "I don't know what their decision making process is but I think if you look back, any innovation that has come in gameplay has come from us."</p>

<p>Yarnton also made reference to Sony's troubles with rumble technology and claimed they were a result of "copying" the technology rather than inventing it.  Sony claimed they dropped the force feedback from their upcoming controller because it interfered with motion sensing, but it's worth nothing they've also had trouble as of late with patent lawsuits from Immersion Corporation over that very feature.</p>
