<p><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/696/696869p1.html">IGN</a> has interviewed Pandemic Studios' director of production, Greg Borrud, regarding the company's Revolution development plans.  Borrud voiced interest as well as reluctance about the company's intent to support the platform.  It seems Nintendo still has some reassuring to do -- hopefully Nintendo will take the opportunity it has at the upcoming <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/conference/keynotes.htm#Nintendo">Game Developer's Conference</a>.</p>

<p>"We are very interested in making games for the Revolution," Borrud told IGN.  "The challenge will be in our approach to these games. As we think about the Xbox 360 and the PS3 we see a lot of similarities between the systems so it will be relatively easy to have a game ship on both platforms. We don't necessarily see those kinds of similarities with the Revolution. Games that are made for the Revolution will really have to be re-conceived for that platform and can't simply be a port. While on the one hand that could mean fewer games for the Revolution, the games that do ship on the platform will probably be crafted with a lot more thought and care than would go into your average port. So yes, we are interested in developing entertainment for the Revolution - but only for the select group of games that really make sense."</p>
