EBGames and Amazon.com currently have <i>Lego Star Wars</i> scheduled for release on the Nintendo GameCube on October 4.  A version of the game was released earlier in the year on both PlayStation 2 and Xbox.  The price is also listed as $29.99.  There is currently no word from Eidos on whether or not this information is correct.  Thanks to NintendoInsider.com for the heads up.
