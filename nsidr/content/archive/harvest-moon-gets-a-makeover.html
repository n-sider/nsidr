<p><i>Harvest Moon: Another Wonderful Life</i> hits shelves today. For those unfamiliar with the title, it's very similar to the first <i>A Wonderful Life</i> except that you are a girl instead of a guy. The bulk of the game is very similar, with only minor altererations here and there. The game should be available for GameCube in stores across North America. <i>Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town</i> is also very similar in the sense that it is basically a rerelease of the <i>Friends of Mineral Town</i> with the ability to play as a girl instead of a boy. It should be available for the Game Boy Advance.

<p>Other (less exciting) new releases include:</p>
<p>GBA - <i>Kim Possible 3</i><br>
GBA -<i> That's So Raven 2</i>
