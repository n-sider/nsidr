A rather significant feature slipped under the radar with the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2998">latest Wii system update</a>. USB keyboards are now supported for use in the Wii Shop Channel and the message board. Currently, the Internet Channel does not support use of a keyboard, but unless this new support is one huge mistake, it is likely the Internet Channel will receive the same support in a future update.<br />
<br />
Another unfortunate result of the update is that the Freeloader no longer works. Gamecube game importers will surely be disappointed, and as the Freeloader is not a Nintendo licensed product, it will most likely never be fixed.<br />
<br />
If you still haven't updated, it's as easy as opening the update announcement on the Wii's message board and following the link or updating through the Wii system menus.
