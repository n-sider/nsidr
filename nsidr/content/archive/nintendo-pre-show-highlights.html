<blockquote><p>
<b>Update #1</b><p>
The conference has begun and they are showing a video of a bunch of games. "We're about making games." Right now a video of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is being shown. Now they are showing Star Fox 2 on the screen. "We like games with big stars and big explosions."<p>
<p>
<b>Update #2</b><p>
Now a video of Resident Evil 4 is being displayed. They are taking some shots at Sony about how everything is on memory sticks, or has to be on <I>their</i> operating system. "We're not that company." Nintendo is going to show you "new ways to relate to your games." "While others are talking, Nintendo is acting." "We have momentum."<p>
<p>
<b>Update #3</b><p>
George Harrison has just been introduced. Nintendo's quarterly growth is up 21%. "Without Nintendo, there is no growth." Nintendo has sold through 3.3 million units through last year--big improvement (sold more games than MS and closing in on Sony).<p>
<p>
Gamers want "familiarity and value" -- "major play for minor pay."  Nintendo sold 73% more GCNs through 2003 holiday season than previous year. "It will be quite some time before someone can match our $99 price point."<p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Update #4</b><p>
"By the time the PSP gets on the ballot next year, the GBA will have over 25 million votes." Nintendo says "Sony has a huge hill to climb." They expect that the GBA SP's battery life will be far better than the PSP's. The GBA is built on the back of "must-have exclusive titles."<p>
<p>
Sony, like Nokia have to find killer-apps to be successful. "In the end, it's still about the games." <p>
<p>

<b>Update #5</b><p>
They've just unveiled the Nintendo DS. It looks very similar to the GBA SP. They say DS is better known as "developer system." "DS changes our industry." The DS will provide gamers with new ways to relate to games. Now they are showing a video of different developers and publishers who are absolutely raving about the DS. They all believe it will be very successful and that it is a very innovative product.<p>
<p>
The DS has two screens, each of which is programable in 2D or 3D. They are showing Mario on the DS on both screens. One character can see two perspectives of a battle at the same time or a map on one screen and the gameplay on the other. A Metroid game is being displayed on DS as well, and will be playable on the show floor at E3. <p>
<p>
The DS will have 2 media bays, one for DS and one for all the GBA games. The DS is fully compatible with all GBA game. The DS screen is touch sensitive and can be used with a stylus. There is also a built-in microphone for voice recognition features in games. "Touch and voice offers vast new realms in gaming." The DS also features wireless gaming.<p>
<p>
<b>Update #6</b><p>
The DS will have Wi-Fi capability to allow it to connect to the 'net. "It changes how you connect to the game and to each other." Another video of developers and publishers is being shown. They are all impressed by the DS' unique set of features, especially the touch screen, the new format of memory, and the multiplayer wireless capabilities. DS is making game designers focus on creativity.<p>
<p>
<b>Update #7</b><p>
Nintendo is targeting release of the DS in North America and Japan for this year still. It will come with a new name, however. The DS will be fully playable with many games on the show floor tomorrow. <p>
<p>
Nintendo's Satoru Iwata has just been introduced. He is saying how proud Nintendo is that their advancements have mostly become industry standards. "DS is not just higher specs, it's Different."  "Different" also describes the approach Nintendo will take for their next console. "Simply beefing up the graphics will not make the difference." The console must deliver something gamers have never seen before. Nintendo's next console is currently being worked on. "Specs don't really matter." When you see it "you will experience a gaming revolution."<p>
<p>
