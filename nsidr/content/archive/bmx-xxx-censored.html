<h3>BMX XXX CEN$@&ED</h3>

<p>The question of censorship has come up in the news again.  The release of Acclaim's <i>BMX XXX</i> has ignited this most recent controversy.

<p>The controversy is the perception by some that <i>BMX XXX</i> is glamorizing sex and violence in material targeted to kids.  The funny thing is, it's not intended for kids.  BMX XXX contains a "Mature" rating.  

<p>Despite its blatant labeling as such, retailers -- Wal-Mart Stores, Toys R Us, KB Toys, Best Buy and Circuit City Stores -- all said this week they would not carry the game. 

<p>Replying to the retailers actions, Acclaim Chief Executive Greg Fischbach said in a statement.  
<p>"We believe that there is a general, unfair characterization of the interactive entertainment industry and as a result, our product is being held to an entirely different standard than other entertainment media with comparable content, including movies, television and radio."

<p>One portion of the game people are particularly weary about is its supposed support of a sniper mode.  In light of recent events, just the thought of it makes people cringe.  What people don't know is that a movie called <a href="http://www.videoflicks.com/titles/1116/1116422.htm?SHOW=1&TYPE=0&ASSN=V00001&ESID=XUUXAUAGAGCEUKEVECUUUU">Liberty Stands Still</a> debuted on Cinemax in early July of 2002.  The movie eerily resembles the recent sniper shootings that have been a hot news item across the US.  It's surprising the media has yet to blame it.  Then again, it's equally surprising that the media hasn't blamed itself for sensationalizing the events.  

<p>The media is playing a large role in the <i>BMX XXX</i> exposure.  We are all about "free speech" and the right to voice one's opinion.  But the fact is, we are also the result of Acclaim's limited expression of free speech.  In our reportings, we have somehow turned a simple mature game into the "downfall of society". 

<p>Before getting too deep into blaming the media, let us move on to another topic.  

<p>Video games share many similarities with that of music.  They are both the expression of artists and are both frequently under the scrutiny of critics.

<p>Wal-Mart, one of the companies involved in the ban of <i>BMX XXX</i> from store shelves, is also one of the country's top music retailers, accounting on average for about 10% of an artists sales.  With that in mind, there are growing fears among musicians, record executives and media watchdogs that Wal-Mart is exploiting its power.  These people say that Wal-Mart's role of "morality police" is changing the way music and video games are made. 

<p>The major downside is when developers make entertainment software and start thinking about where it's going to be sold.  This censorship becomes counterproductive when it infects the art that people are creating.

<p>As is commonly known, Wal-Mart has asked artists and their labels to clean up music records for years. In a New York Times article a report appeared detailing the retailer's banning of a Sheryl Crow album because of the lyric: <i>"Watch our children as they kill each other with a gun they bought at Wal-Mart discount stores"</i>. Crow refused to change the verse and thus Wal-Mart refused to stock it.

<p>The reason behind Sheryl Crow's lyric is the fact that Wal-Mart attempts to be Big Brother by asking the entertainment industry to clean up their products, yet at the same time, the company has no problem selling guns. Wal-Mart needs not be hypocritical in its practices. (Of note, not all Wal-Marts sell guns.  A company spokesman said that stores that carry guns comply with local laws regarding firearms. Nevertheless, Wal-Mart has been sued twice by relatives of people killed with guns bought at its stores.) 

<p>Wal-Mart <i>does</i> have the right to sell anything it wants, as we all do.  At the end of the day, it's simply up to entertainment companies whether or not they want to pander to Wal-Mart by changing the content of their software.

<p>Then, with a swift movement of the wrist, the tables can again be turned on the media. 

<p>Wal-Mart spokesman Dale Ingram poses the thought.  "It's like a person being quoted in your news organization. He's not going to use a string of expletives and expect to be quoted, right? So that's all we're trying to do," 

<p>Oh, sh%#, he's got a point.

<p>People have throughout history attempted to censor that of which is taboo.  What is seen as weird or frightening, is in a way, reality.  If there's a larger influence though, it is that of the media.  We create the topics that are on people's thoughts.  Sex, chaos and murder is seen daily on news headlines.  Yet still, we censor that of which is <i>real</i>.  In a free society though, it should be up to the individual consumer, with his or her own individual morals (as long as it doesn't infringe on another's right), to decide what to and not to purchase.  But, as it stands, others are trying to make that decision for us. 

<p>If you agree or disagree with the actions of these companies, do share your opinion.
