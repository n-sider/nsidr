<p><a href="http://trigames.net/newsitem.php?content_id=442&console=">TriGames.net</a> caught up with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>, Nintendo of America VP of Sales and Marketing, at the Nintendo World Store located in New York.  Fils-Aime was available for two hours to answer questions and interact with Nintendo fans.</p>

<p>Of note, Fils-Aime let info slip about a racing title in development for Nintendo's Wii console.  "I'm going to give one little secret," Fils-Aime said. "Only one little secret, and hopefully I won't lose my job. We're going to show a racing game at E3 where you use the core controller in a very different way. That will answer all the questions to how you'll play a racing game."</p>

<p>Look to Nintendo's E3 press conference on May 9, for more info.</p>
