So, I think the biggest hit right now with some of the staff is DDR: With Mario, now called Mario Mix.
<br><br>
On first glance, the essence of DDR has been preserved and reborn nicely on the GameCube; the arrows are perfect (eg. they look identical to the PS2/Xbox Predecessors), and the music (from what we could hear on the loud show floor) was a great rehash of classic Nintendo Themes.<br><br>
The only major qualm so far is that the steps are too easy, even on hard mode, it is the equivalent to standard or even novice in the DDR's for the PS2. Hopefully, in time, this will be fixed.<br><br>

Expect an N-Depth in early June when the staff returns from E3.
