<i>Bass Fishing Wii</i>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2875">recently announced</a> for Japan, now has an American release as well, thanks to Aksys Games. The official English title is <i>Hooked! Real Motion Fishing</i>.<br />
<br />
The announcement brings with it some clarification on the game's features. There are three self-explanatory single-player game modes: Practice, Time Attack, and Tournament. Unfortunately, details abotut he online mode are still scarce. The controls are simple; use the remote to pull the fishing pole in different directions while reeling the nunchuk.<br />
<br />
Hooked! Real Motion Fishing will hit North American stores this fall.
