Coming out of the UK is news that Nintendo <a href="http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/business/news/tm_headline=nintendo-places-city-firm-on-approved-designers-list%26method=full%26objectid=18490433%26siteid=50061-name_page.html">has approved</a> a six-man shop known as Playbox, based in Liverpool, for development on Wii.<br />
<br />
Playbox's credits include primarily outsourcing duties, having done work on titles like <i>Football Manager Pub Quiz</i> and <i>Buzz: The Music Quiz</i>.  The developer had recently visited Japan as part of a "trade mission" for Liverpool companies, and made contact with Capcom at TGS.<br />
<br />
Capcom returned the favor with a visit back to Playbox, and it appears the team is looking to work with Capcom in the future.  "Because Wii is such a new product, Nintendo is being fairly restrictive about the number of companies it's allowing to work on game development so getting approval is fantastic for us," Playbox managing director Gary Nichols explained.  "After one meeting in Japan, Capcom travelled to Liverpool to see us and we're both keen to see what we can create together."
