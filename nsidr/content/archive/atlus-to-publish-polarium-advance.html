<p>Hot off the wires comes the news that Atlus U.S.A. will be publishing Game Boy Advance puzzler <cite>Polarium Advance</cite> in the States.</p>

<p>The title features gameplay similar to the Nintendo DS release <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=968"><cite>Polarium</cite></a>, though game modes are changed up for the new platform.  The original "challenge" mode, which adapted Polarium's tile-flipping game mechanic to the falling-block genre, is replaced by a new "time attack" mode where you must solve a set number of puzzles in the shortest amount of time possible.  The "puzzles" mode has apparently been expanded into "daily Polarium" mode with 365 puzzles avaliable.</p>

<p>Polarium Advance also retains one key feature that made Polarium a standout: the ability to create their own puzzles (with up to 100 slots available) and send them to friends to solve.  Polarium Advance also boasts alternative color schemes and new tiles including "Hurdle", "Solid", and "Joker" tiles.</p>

<p>Polarium Advance was developed by Mitchell and was published in Japan and Europe by Nintendo.  The game is jointly copyright Nintendo and Mitchell.  Atlus expects to release Polarium Advance this coming November.</p>
