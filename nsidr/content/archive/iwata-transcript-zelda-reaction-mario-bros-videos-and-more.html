<p>How about we close the night with a few last tidbits lost in the commotion earlier today.

<ul>
<li>Check out the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=JHmGp9lB1gw">audience's reaction</a> at Iwata's keynote to the presentation of The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass video.  You can almost feel the excitement.<br><br>

<li>The wonderful chaps at <a href="http://crystaltips.typepad.com/wonderland/2006/03/gdc_satoru_iwat.html">Wonderland</a> have tidied up a transcript of Satoru Iwata's keynote speech from earlier this morning at the Game Developer's Conference.  Makes much more sense when there's a consistent flow to it, doesn't it?<br><br>

<li>Reggie Fils-Aime told <a href="http://ds.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=3473">AdvancedMN.com</a> that the Nintendo DS Lite release date announcement is "coming soon" and that we'll simply have to wait.<br><br>

<li>IGN has uploaded <a href="http://media.ds.ign.com/media/682/682879/vids_1.html">several videos</a> of New Super Mario Bros.' one and multi-player modes.  There's a total of four videos showcasing the game's various environments and modes.<br><br>

<li><a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news15040_conference-nintendo-au-gdc-2006.html">Jeux-France</a> has uploaded several pictures taken from Iwata's keynote earlier today.  The pictures were snapped during the Brain Training, Zelda DS video, Revolution controller, and Virtual Console portions of the speech.

  </ul>
