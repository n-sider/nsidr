<p>Some <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6141065.html">early details</a> for the previously-announced <i>Tales</i> game for Nintendo DS have come down from Namco, courtesy GameSpot.  The game's title is <i>Tales of the Tempest</i>, and Mutsumi Inomata, character designer for <i>Tales of Destiny</i>, is on-board to pull off the same for this new title.</p>

<p><i>Tempest</i> is slated for a 2006 release in Japan.  At this time, no plans have been announced for a US release; hopefully either Namco or Nintendo will publish it quickly so we don't have to deal with the same wait we did for <i>Tales of Phantasia</i> making it outside Japan.</p>
