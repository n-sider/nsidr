<b>Temple Grounds:</b> Buff-colored stone canyons and small leafless trees covered in shimmering webbing greet my eyes.  Giant cocoons dot the landscape and spherical fungus pour green spores into the air.  Everywhere, there are fluttering moths that gather around the glow of Samus' Morph Ball.  When first stepping off of Samus' ship on Tallon IV, the landscape was somewhat recognizable with its green growing things; the first introduction to Aether is of a stranger more unfamiliar world, but not an unlovely one.  <br />

<b>Agon Wastes:</b> This is the land of stone and sand.  Here grows the blue root tree, brilliantly neon blue and enigmatically insubstantial.  Pillar-like rock formations and tunnels meld into Luminoth architecture and iconography.  Nestled deep in this quiet land is a nest of Space Pirates.  They've burrowed deep and built a fortress directly into the sandstone cliffs.<br />

<br />
<b>Torvus Bog:</b> The bog has the feel of an industrial site set within flooded canyons.  Dull brown vine like trees tangle into knots in this gloomy landscape of steamy falls and toxic plant life.  The rooms beneath the temple are partially submerged and home to predatory fish and odd machinery.<br />

<br />
<b>Sanctuary Fortress:</b> High-tech, alight with color and alive with alien technology.  Holographic cubes, glowing energy cores, circuit board streams of light etched in the very air&mdash;this is a place of wonders.  Sanctuary Fortress is a contender for best environment in the <i>Prime</i> trilogy.  There is so much variety here that it is difficult to characterize to those who have never seen it.<br />

<b>Dark Aether:</b> The very air here is fouled with an inky miasma.  Passages are blocked by giant writhing worms and monstrous claws.  The landscape is saturated with dark purple and black beneath a glaring red sky.  The very land intimidates the warrior and crushes the spirit.  This is the dark tunnel the heroine must travel down&mdash;beware, a dragon waits at the end.
