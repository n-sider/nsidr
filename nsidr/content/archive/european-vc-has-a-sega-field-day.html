This week, Europe gets four new VC releases&mdash;three Mega Drive games and one TurboGrafx-16 game&mdash;bringing the total up to 109. <br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</i> (Mega Drive, 800 points)</li>
  <li><i>Ecco: The Tides of Time</i> (Mega Drive, 800 points)</li>
  <li><i>Golden Axe II</i> (Mega Drive, 800 points)</li>
  <li><i>Dragon Sprit</i> (TurboGrafx-16, 600 points)</li>
  </ul><br />
Between taking control of a dolphin, a blue hedgehog, a dragon, and magic-wielding warriors, there's plenty to do this week.
