<p>Back in November, we let you know that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1501">Nintendo was partnering with BT Openzone</a> for Wi-Fi Connection access across the UK.  This week, they've jumped into phase two of that agreement, <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/news.php?aid=15566">installing over 500 new BT Openzone hotspots</a>.</p>

<p>The hotspots are being installed in retail stores such as GAME, Gamestation, HMV, and Toys 'R Us and will offer DS downloads as well as access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Beyond the recently-installed hotspots, Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection is also available from 7,500 other hotspots in the country.</p>
