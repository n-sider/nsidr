<p>During the ELSPA Games Summit, Microsoft corporate vice-president Peter Moore has called on platform competitors Sony and Nintendo to follow the XNA model for their console hardware, according to <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=dev&aid=3587">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.</p>

<p>Moore said that benefits of using the system would be faster and more cost-effective game development and also make development such that informed judgements on whether or not to continue with projects can be made much earlier in the development cycle.</p>

<p>He also spoke about companies' increasing use of movie and sports licenses saying, "There's always going to be a place for having movie licenses and sports licenses but the sequelisation of entertainment is something that concerns me about this industry... We need to build IP and own IP in this industry, rather than pay the movie companies and the sports companies for the ability to live vicariously through their licenses."</p>

<p>He also noted that such devices as Sony's EyeToy, along with Microsoft's own Xbox video chat system, are key examples of companies continuing to innovate during the lifecycle of a console.</p>
