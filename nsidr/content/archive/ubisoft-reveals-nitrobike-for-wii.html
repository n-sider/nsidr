Ubisoft announced it will publish Nitrobike, a motocross racing game exclusively for Wii.  The game is being developed by Left Field Productions, the former Nintendo second-party studio behind the creation of Excitebike 64 and NBA Courtside.  Players will use the Wii remote to guide rocket-propelled motorcycles across hilly terrain and huge jumps.  Ubisoft said we can expect Nitrobike to speed into stores this holiday.
