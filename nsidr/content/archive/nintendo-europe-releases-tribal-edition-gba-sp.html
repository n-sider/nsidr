<p>This past week, Nintendo Europe released a newly-designed Game Boy Advance SP for 90 Euros.  Called the "Tribal Edition", the system is colored silver and contains "tribal" patterned tattoos on the inside and outside.</p>

<blockquote><p><font size="2">"We feel we have created a product in the Tribal Edition that reflects the sentiments of today's youth - rebellion, attractiveness and spirituality," said Tim Freystedt, European Marketing Manager Game Boy Advance, apparently with a straight face. "The new console allows gamers to express these emotions in a fun and interactive way, enabling them to communicate their individuality."</font></p></blockquote>
