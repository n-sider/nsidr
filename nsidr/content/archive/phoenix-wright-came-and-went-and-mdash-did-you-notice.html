<p>Fans hoping to get their hands on Capcom's increasingly rare <cite>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</cite> may have missed their opportunity recently.</p>

<p>Punch Jump has been watching for the new shipment Capcom was to send to stores&mdash;and they report that at least at online outlets like Walmart.com and JR.com <a href="http://news.punchjump.com/article.php?id=2621">the game sold out in days</a>.  They've also noted that eBay prices routinely go for a 30% premium over the game's $30 list price due to limited quantities.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if Phoenix watchers are lucky, Capcom will ship a larger restock next time.</p>
