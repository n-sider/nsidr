<p>Nintendo's "Nintendo World Store" in New York City, will be broadcasting the Nintendo E3 2006 Press Conerence/Keynote speech live on May 9th.</p>
<p>Space is extremely limited, and they are requesting that you RSVP at their website, <a href="http://nintendoworldstore.com/">nintendoworldstore.com</a>
as soon as possible. Please note that this store is located in New York City, only RSVP if you are able to be there on May 9th, 2006.</p>
<p> As an added bonus, it will be customer appreciation day, so expect some insane deals as Nintendo celebrates the unveiling of Wii. The broadcast starts at 12:30pm EDT, with competitions and prizes to follow at 1:30pm to 5:00pm.</p>
<p> Keep your browser locked on N-Sider.com for all your E3 coverage, and if you do go to the world store event and plan to take pictures, <a href="mailto:news@n-sider.com?subject=worldstorepics">we'd love to see them </a></p>
