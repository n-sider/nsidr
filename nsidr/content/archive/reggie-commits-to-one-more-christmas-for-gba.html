Also of note from the Reuters Media Summit, from which <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2540">we reported yesterday</a> on Wii sales, is NOA president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>'s statement that he <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6162488.html">intends to continue</a> to support Game Boy Advance for one more Christmas, at least.<br />
<br />
"We think that Game Boy Advance certainly has at least one more holiday season left in it," Reggie explained, calling GBA a "gateway console".  "For us, it continues to be a great stepping stone for five-, six-, seven-year old consumers to have their first great handheld gaming experience and then transition right into DS."<br />
<br />
Game Boy Advance still retails for around $80 in the States, but some retailers were selling the still-popular <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=23">Game Boy Advance SP</a> model for $50.  The "style-conscious" <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=28">Game Boy micro</a>, effectively considered a flop, was selling on Black Friday for $35-$40 in some stores.  Nintendo also currently has only a single Game Boy Advance release announced for the future: <i>Final Fantasy VI Advance</i>, scheduled for release in early February.
