<p>Thanks to a tip from reader Jeff Haskell, word on the street is that GameStop will begin taking pre-orders for the Nintendo Wii on October 9.  Allegedly this will be a single day event.</p>

<p>N-Sider has telephoned over a dozen GameStop outlets around the United States -- from Seattle to Minneapolis to Los Angeles -- to confirm this information.  All stores with the exception of those located in the state of Pennsylvania (where coincidentally reader Haskell resides) confirmed the October 9 date. Meanwhile, stores that weren't aware of the pre-order date mentioned that their managers would be going to a meeting in the next week where they would learn more about the upcoming Wii launch.</p>

<p>We'll keep you posted.  And let us know if you hear of anything.</p>
