<p>Official Nintendo Magazine, published in the UK, has word that Brownie Brown's <cite>Magical Vacation 2</cite> <a href="http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/news_050506_magical.html">is headed for a European release come this January.</p>

<p>The original <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=396">Magical Vacation</a></cite> was only released in Japan, back in December 2001.  It was the first release from the then-newly-formed Brownie Brown, a 100%-owned Nintendo subsidiary led by ex-Square employees responsible for the Secret of Mana series and the Saga Frontier series.</p>

<p>In the US, we did see Brownie Brown's <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=351">Sword of Mana</a></cite>, a remake of the Game Boy <cite>Seiken Densetsu</cite>.  <cite>Sword</cite> was supported by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=382">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a>'s Fund Q.</p>

<p><cite>Magical Vacation 2</cite> has not yet been announced for US release, but we just might hear about it at next week's E3 2006 show.  Keep your ears peeled and N-Sider bookmarked for any news.</p>
