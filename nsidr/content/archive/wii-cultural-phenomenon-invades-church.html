Between this sermon, the local watering hole proudly touting the fact that you can get your Tennis on in-between imbibes, and a little karate dojo sticking the word "Wii" in huge print in their tiny ad to let you know you might win one if your kid signs up for lessons&#8212;all sighted within the past week&#8212;it's clear that, at least in my hometown, Wii is on everyone's mind.
