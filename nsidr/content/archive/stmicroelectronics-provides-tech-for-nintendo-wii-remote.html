<p><a href="http://www.st.com/stonline/stappl/press/news/year2006/t2031.htm">STMicroelectronics</a> has partnered with Nintendo to provide its three-axis acceleration sensors used in the Nintendo Wii remote controller.  These sensors detect changes in direction, speed, and acceleration of a player's hand in all three dimensions.  The miniature sensor is said to provide "immunity to vibration and a shock resistance" and "ultra-low power consumption."</p>

<p>"ST's silicon expertise and leadership in micro-machining technologies has enabled the company to deliver a most cost-effective combination of sensor resolution, size, and power characteristics," said <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a>, Senior Managing Director/General Manager of Integrated Research & Development Division, Nintendo Co., Ltd. "Another key factor in our choice of ST's motion sensors was the company's full ownership of the device manufacturing flow, which guarantees high quality, roadmap continuity, and security of supply."</p>
