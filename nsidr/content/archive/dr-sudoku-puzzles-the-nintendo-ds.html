<p>Dr. Sudoku is the video game form of this popular puzzle game where players are presented with nine three-by-three grids and must fill in the blank squares so that each column, row, and three-by-three grid contains the numbers 1 through 9.  The title contains over 1,000 puzzles and a mode to create your own Sudoku puzzles.</p>

Nintendo Power says (6/10),<br>
"Dr. Sudoku doesn't offer any puzzle types aside from the traditional nine by nine grid.  On the other hand, Dr. Sudoku does offer the much-appreciated ability to take in-game notes.  If you have a yearning for pure sudoku in video game form, Dr. Sudoku will provide a cure, but more options and a sharper presentation would have gone a long way."
