<p><b>9:53:</b> IGN says, "Bill Trinen takes stage to talk about Wii channels. Says that these channels will make non-gamers want to pick up the Wii. Trinen goes into the Mii channel, which enables users to create virtual versions of themselves. He says he wants to create Samuel L. Jackson. Modifies hair and face on a 3D model. Changes eyes. Changes nose. Changes lips. Gives him a mustache. Changes the color of his clothes. Enter his name. This is all done easily with the Wii-mote by pointing and clicking."</p>

<p><b>9:53:</b> Bill Trinen says after clickon the Photo Channel... "For the first time ever, photo viewing is not a time-consuming thing." Take SD Card out of your digital camera, insert into the front flap on Wii and "boom -- you're looking at digital photos." The interface is smooth, fast and easy.

<p><b>9:46:</b> AdvancedMN says, "The points can be obtained online or at retail, with 2000 points being $20. When a game is downloaded, it becomes its own channel on the Virtual Console menu."</p>

<p><b>9:36:</b> GameSpot says, "Reggie's talking about the 25-game launch lineup, not surprisingly being led by The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. Excite Truck will also be out on day one.
