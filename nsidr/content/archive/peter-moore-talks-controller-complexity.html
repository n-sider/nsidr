<p>Microsoft's Peter Moore, fresh from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2191">his E3 and post-E3 commentary on Wii</a>, had <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=13001">even more to say</a> to Gamertag Radio, touching on controller complexity and the innovation of the Wii Remote.</p>

<p>"<cite>Sonic [Wild Fire]</cite> was almost built for the controller because it was so intuitive," Moore says.  "...Shoulder buttons, triggers, analog sticks, d-pads, I mean, there's a lot going on there when you compare it to the old Atari 2600 button-and-stick, which everybody could pick up and have some fun with... Clearly, I think the Wii is trying to get back to those days."

<p>Moore said his 14-year-old daughter finds the Xbox 360 controller overly complicated.  "She's frustrated because of the button configurations and the use of triggers; she just doesn't quite get it."  To that end, Moore hints Microsoft may have something in the works: "[Microsoft is] doing a lot of stuff there.  Nothing that we're ready to talk about, and we're not going to force anything that is not going to be intuitive and innovative."</p>
