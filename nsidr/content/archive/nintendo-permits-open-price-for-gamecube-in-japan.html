<p><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/">Gamasutra</a> is <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6828">reporting that Nintendo is now permitting "open price" for GameCube</a> in Japan, according to an official Nintendo Co. report in that country.</p>

<p>The policy permits retailers to sell the GameCube at any price they see fit, rather than selling it at a price Nintendo dictates.  The practice has also been used by Sony since May 2005 for the PlayStation 2.</p>
