<p>The Nintendo DS will utilize its wireless communication capability to download extras, such as new characters, from the new Pokemon movie scheduled to release next summer, according to Reuters.</p>

<p><center><font size="2">"You just need to bring the DS and one of the Pokemon software for Game Boy Advance and you'll be downloading some unique Pokemon data while you watch the movie," said Nintendo Co., Ltd. president Satoru Iwata.</font></center></p>

<p>More information on this capability will likely be released soon.</p>

<p>A total of 124 DS games are said to be under development by 46 companies.  Nintendo recently raised its global shipment target of the DS machine by the end of March 2005 to 4 million units from the initial 3.5 million estimate.</p> 

<p><center><font size="2">"It's possible that total DS software shipments will exceed our estimate of 15 million units by the end of next March," said Iwata.</font></center></p>
