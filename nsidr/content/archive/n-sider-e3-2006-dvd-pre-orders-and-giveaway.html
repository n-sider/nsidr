With E3 2006 on the horizon, we here at N-Sider thought it would be a good time to announce plans for our upcoming E3 2006 DVD.  After much preliminary deliberation, we've eschewed the format we've used for previous years in favor of an interesting and highly experimental "documentary" style production for this year's show.<br><br>

Armed with two cameras, N-Sider staff members Dean Bergmann and Brandon Daiker will each take upwards of twenty 30-second clips per day of the show and other staff events. This will yield approximately twenty minutes of footage each day that, over the course of six days, should provide at least two hours of DVD footage to be edited together chronologically.<br><br>

What does this mean for the viewer?  Not only will it remove any "garbage" filler footage, it allows us to present only the moments we found most interesting: overlooked games, cool little side events, and much more.<br><br>

You may be thinking, what about the press conferences?  Surely you can't just be taking thirty second clips of those, too?  Well, don't fret. We're going to film those as we always have -- fully unedited from start to finish.  We plan to have footage from the three major players (Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft) once again this year, as well as B-Roll footage from Nintendo included on the disc.<br><br>

Coupled with some other special features we're planning to shoot while we're in Los Angeles, as well as one or two celebrity appearances, the final DVD will be offered once again at an insanely low price of $6 shipped to anywhere on the planet.<br><br>

Pre-Orders are now available for those of you with PayPal. If you don't have PayPal, you'll be able to order the DVDs via international money order upon their release in late May. The DVDs are expected to ship by the end of May 2006.<br><br>

<b>DVD orders will reopen shortly, please allow us time to send out the preorders.</b><br><br>

As an added bonus, our friends at Tomy have provided a copy of <b>Naruto: Ninja Council</b> for the Game Boy Advance to give away to N-Sider readers. You can enter the giveaway for free by clicking <a href="/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1916">here</a>. However, if you pre-order our E3 DVD between now and April 31st, you will get an additional THREE entries toward the giveaway. (If your standard email address is different than the email address you use for PayPal, please include your standard email address in the "optional notes" section of the PayPal screen.)<br><br>

Please note that all DVD-Preorders are non refundable, and the final discs will likely contain offensive language and materials not suitable for children.
