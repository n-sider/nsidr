<p>GameSHOUT is <a href="http://www.gameshout.com/news/122005/article1817.htm">reporting that Nintendo UK is having a hard time</a> keeping <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><i>Nintendogs</i></a> on the shelves this season.</p>

<p>According to their article, retailers all over the UK are reporting low or insufficient stock, making the game very difficult to find  and eBayers are making a mint selling the copies they have.</p>

<p>Some online retailers are reported to have sold out their blue and pink Nintendogs/Nintendo DS bundles; others are reporting limited stocks.  Restocking is expected to come in a week, but at this point, few sellers are guaranteeing anything for Christmas.</p>
