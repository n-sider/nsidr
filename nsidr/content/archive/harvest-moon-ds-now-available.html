"It takes advantage of the platform's technology like a laptop bought for Windows solitaire, but Harvest Moon DS still manages to be a decent game. If players focus on what it is rather than what it could have been, there's a good chance you'll be entertained. That's easier said than done, though, and the lack of innovation may even cause current series fans to refuse to send their old version to the glue factory. But, if cutesy farming RPG makes you raise an inquisitive eyebrow rather than gag, Harvest Moon DS may be worth cultivating."

"Harvest Moon has been a solid adventure in the portable world for over a decade, starting first on the original Game Boy, and progressing to the GBC and GBA. Even still, each generation added something new to the mix, starting with simple color display, and ending with a full immersive town and nearly endless replay value. On DS, however, it seems like the development team simply added basic bottom screen item management and a few animal interactions and called it a day. The main bulk of the game is still single screen, uses a ton of the same assets from the Friends of Mineral Town world, and though the game is supposed to be set up in a different town, a ton of the characters "mysteriously" make cameos. Even still, Harvest Moon DS is as solid of a farm simulator as it ever was, and just because it doesn't add a ton of touch or visual flare to the mix doesn't mean it's a total wash."
