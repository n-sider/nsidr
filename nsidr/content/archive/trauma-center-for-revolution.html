<p>Reportedly speculated on in Nintendo Power, and now <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/692/692479p3.html">confirmed by IGN</a> is the news that Atlus will bring an exclusive installment of <i>Trauma Center: Under the Knife</i> to the Revolution.</p>

<p><i>Trauma Center</i> was originally published by Atlus for the Nintendo DS last year, and quickly became a favorite for its stylus-based, unrealistic-yet-thrilling surgery gameplay.  Atlus says the Revolution game is in development and if all goes well, it will be playable at E3 2006.</p>
