<p>First 4 Figures has reached a three-year licensing agreement with Nintendo to create collectibles based on the Metroid franchise. "We are extremely excited to be working with First 4 Figures to develop a line of figures inspired by Metroid," said Gail Tilden, VP of Nintendo Brand Management. "Metroid fans have come to expect the best from our video games and we are confident First 4 Figures will deliver the same quality with their statues."</p>

<p>The first of the statues will be on display within Nintendo's booth during E3. Two types of figurines will be produced including single statues and VS dioramas which stand approximately 9 to 12 inches tall.  These will retail for $85 to $120 for single statues and $200+ for high end VS dioramas.  The studio has lofty product development plans that span three Metroid games.
