Nintendo of America has announced that they have donated 100 Wii systems (in the form of "party packs') to chapters of the YMCA, for use in the organization's parent-child Adventure Guides program.<br />
<br />
Several of the chapters will be hosting Healthy Kids Day events this Saturday, and many will be incorporating Wii.  Though chapter participation will vary, some participants will play <i>Wii Sports</i> at the event.<br />
<br />
George Harrison opines on the donation thusly: "Consumers all over America are telling us the Wii helps them to stay active and fit and also gives them another reason to be together as a family.  Wii has quickly become a part of America's fitness plan, from bowling leagues for active seniors to kids and parents who sweat through Wii Sports pentathlons together."
