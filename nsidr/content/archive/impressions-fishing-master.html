Hudson and Konami's <i>Fishing Master</i>, while something that did not immediately call out to me as something I had to own, still managed to impress me considerably when I spent some time playing it at this past week's E3 show.<br />
<br />
Your objective as player is apparently to catch and catalog all the fish present in the waters you have access to, and you do this through a very well-done Wii control scheme.  Casting is done by holding the B button on the underside of the Remote and swinging your hand forward in a tossing motion, releasing B to actually toss out the line.<br />
<br />
Once out, you can move the line around with the Remote a bit to jiggle it, or move the Nunchuk in a circular fashion to reel the line in.  When a fish bites, you jerk the Remote up to hook him, and start reeling him in&mdash;not so slowly that he gets away, nor so fast that the line breaks; both indicated on a meter on the top of the screen.  The fish can often make a break for the left or right, in which case you'll need to move the remote in the opposite direction to keep him from getting away.<br />
<br />
The whole experience impressed me by how smooth it was.  I may still not necessarily <i>want</i> a fishing game&mdash;merely because of my tastes&mdash;but if I did, Fishing Master would be it.  It just works that well.
