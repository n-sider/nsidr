Nintendo Japan will release several accessories for the upcoming Game Boy Micro.  Due to its size, the unit will not be compatible with Game Boy Advance link cables and charger units.  Nintendo will however release an adapter called the GB Micro Conversion Connector for 800 to allow the use of standard Game Boy Advance link cables.  In addition, a link cable made specifically for the Game Boy Micro will be released for 1,400 ($13).  A Game Boy Micro wireless adapter will also be released for 2,000.  Images of these can be found on Nintendo's <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/micro/hardware/equipment/index.html">website</a>.

<ul>
<li>Japan -- September 13 for 12,000
<li>United States --  September 19 for $99.99
