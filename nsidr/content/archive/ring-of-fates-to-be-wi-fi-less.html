It seems that Square just can't get the hang of online play on the DS&mdash;Chris Kohler of Wired is now <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/05/handson_final_f.html">confirming</a> that <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</i> will indeed be without Wi-Fi play, requiring players to be in range of each other to enjoy the game's much-vaunted multiplayer mode.<br />
<br />
As consolation, Kohler reports that the single-player game has been fleshed out considerably from the somewhat lacking experience from the GameCube's <i>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</i>.  The entire single-player adventure is playable in either single or multiplayer mode, and though it was unclear whether you could switch between the two at will (a la <i>Children of Mana</i>), it would be surprising if it wasn't the case.
