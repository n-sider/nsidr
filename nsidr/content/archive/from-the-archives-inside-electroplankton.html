Today, Nintendo released the remaining five pieces of <i>Electroplankton</i> as 200-point DSiWare, giving DSi owners the ability to experience individual pieces of this unique title instead of needing to acquire the whole package&mdash;a task made difficult these days due to its rarity and resulting high asking price.<br />
<br />
For those who weren't DS owners at the time, weren't following it quite so hardcore, or were utterly befuddled by Reggie's bizarre showing of the game at E3, you might be wondering which of these ten interactive art pieces you should consider dropping $2 apiece on.  Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/content.php">N-Sider archives</a> have your back.<br />

James Burns' <i>Inside Electroplankton</i> doesn't just walk you through the ten modes but also takes you into the world of the game itself, speaking to its positioning in Nintendo's then-infant DS library and also giving you a glimpse into the man behind the title, media artist Toshio Iwai.  You can follow the sidebar links into our own forums, where you can see both our befuddlement at the original announcement and even read about yours truly's first experiences with the title.  You can even grab yourself some <i>Electroplankton</i> wallpaper.<br />
<br />
Without further ado, then, continue on inside to read James Burns' in-depth look <i>Inside Electroplankton</i>.<br />
