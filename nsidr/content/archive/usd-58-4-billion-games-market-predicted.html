<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/">BusinessWeek</a> has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/oct2005/id20051024_124078.htm">an article on the fifth edition of Innova's "Dynamic of Games" report</a>, which is predicting the global games market will grow 35% from 2005 to 2007.</p>

<p>The report also predicts that Sony may lose its dominance to Microsoft and Nintendo.  "While we still expect the PS3 to lead the next wave of consoles, it will not be the one-horse race of the previous generation. The Xbox 360 will benefit from first-mover advantage and Nintendo has already revealed some interesting ideas for its Revolution concept."</p>
