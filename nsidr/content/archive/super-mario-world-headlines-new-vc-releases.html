It's that time of the week, and Nintendo has put three new old games up on the Wii's Virtual Console.  The titles are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Super Mario World</i> (Super NES, 1-2 players, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>VIGILANTE</i> (TurboGrafx-16, 1 player, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Gain Ground</i> (Sega Genesis, 1-2 players, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
As usual, all games are emulated versions of the originals with no changes.  The titles will be posted at 9 a.m. Pacific Time.  In North America, Wii Points are available for roughly $1 per 100.
