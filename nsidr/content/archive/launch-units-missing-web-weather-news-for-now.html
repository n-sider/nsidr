When launch-day Wii buyers unbox their new consoles, plug them in, and get them online, one thing they <i>won't</i> be able to get right into is the news and weather channels, nor will they be able to get their hands on the Wii version of the Opera web browser&mdash;they've been <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=21177">delayed</a>.<br />
<br />
The Forecast Channel is scheduled to launch first, on December 20th.    January 27 will see the launch of the News Channel.  No date has been set for the release of the Opera web browser, which Opera has said will be <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2458">a free download</a> until the middle of 2007.<br />
<br />
In the face of this news, Wii owners can take comfort in the announcement that twelve Virtual Console titles will be available immediately at launch, with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2503">30 available</a> by the end of the year.
