On July 31, customers who had put down money for <i>Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol</i> with preorder kings GameStop got an unpleasant surprise: the retailer was <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=176115">calling them</a> and informing them their preorder had been cancelled.<br />
<br />
Nintendo made no moves to confirm or deny this, however further rumors indicated the game had been delayed.  GameSpot's Rumor Control column sought to uncover the truth behind the rumor, and <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/show_blog_entry.php?topic_id=25834134">secured a statement</a> from Nintendo indicating the game's new status: a Wal-Mart exclusive.<br />
<br />
The game, which we <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-chibi-robo-park-patrol">previewed</a> when it debuted at E3 2006, is set to hit Wal-Mart's shelves October 2nd&mdash;about a week after its previously-announced release date of September 24.
