The long-awaited Nintendo DS installment in the 21-year-old <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/games.php?view=browse&filter=series&group=1">Legend of Zelda series</a>, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>, has finally been given a date by Nintendo of America this morning.  The title will hit American store shelves October 1, a mere three months from now.<br />
<br />
Phantom Hourglass has been out in Japan a week now, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2889">impressions of the game</a> by importers and Japanese reviewers alike have been largely positive.  We <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-zelda-phantom-hourglass">previewed</a> the title at last year's E3 show, and several of us here at N-Sider are eagerly awaiting the final release this October.<br />
<br />
Nintendo will be offering a "subject to availability" bonus for My Nintendo members who've registered their DS, register the game online, and fill out a short survey: a DS stylus that looks like an "old-fashioned quill pen, modeled after an item in the game"&mdash;presumably the pen used with the game's most distinguishing feature: drawing on the sea charts and game maps.<br />
<br />
Phantom Hourglass is still awaiting a rating from the ESRB, and Nintendo has yet to unveil the box art.
