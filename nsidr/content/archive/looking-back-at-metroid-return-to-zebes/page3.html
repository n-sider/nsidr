<i>Super Metroid</i> took the design concepts of the first two <i>Metroid</i>s, expanded upon them, added to them, and polished everything to a brilliant gleam.  Enemies came in a bigger variety of shapes, sizes and behaviors.  The world was vastly more expansive and interconnected through a dizzying array of secret passages.  There were more unique boss encounters, each one an adrenaline rush, a counterpoint to the quieter explorative spirit which brought me to their lairs.  Each new region was given a unique visual flair and distinct set of challenges.  Best of all for those of us prone to getting hopelessly lost, this <i>Metroid</i> came with a map that revealed itself as I delved ever deeper.  <br />

As with the previous two games, Samus gathers upgrades to expand her catalog of abilities.  Most of her powers this time around were familiar from previous games, though the Grapple Beam and Speed Booster debuted here.  The Speed Booster in particular deserves a special mention as its various Shine Sparking abilities completely blew open <i>Super Metroid</i>'s world and every 2D <i>Metroid</i> to follow.  The Speed Booster gave Samus the power to smash invincibly through most enemies and obstacles, tear through the air like a missile, open hidden passages, and run faster than a flaming hedgehog.  Plus, it just looked really cool.<br />

Like many pre-internet gamers, I had no clue about these additional abilities until that moment of serendipity when I left the game's title screen on long enough to cycle through the demo.  Other abilities were taught to players directly by the few friendly inhabitants of Zebes.  The famous Etecoons and Dachora demonstrated wall jumping and shinesparking respectively.  Even boss fights were not without their surprises.  Draygon, the guardian of Maridia, could be an incredibly tough foe&mdash;but with a little lateral thinking, the Grapple Beam could bring it low. <br />

Aside from finding hidden talents, the game also surprises with unique encounters as the world is explored. Near the Wrecked Ship is a Geemer decked out in Varia Suit colors that will follow Samus around. Deep in Maridia is the Shaktool, an odd excavation robot that could open a new path.  Almost every time I've played this game I stumble across something delightfully unexpected (one of the joys of not spoiling a game with a FAQ).  During one of my most recent play throughs I found what looked like a <i>Super Mario</i> Buzzy Beetle cameo.  These little critters were guarded by a mother turtle whose shell I could stand upon for a skyward lift.  Discovery is the reason we explore, and <i>Super Metroid</i> offers all manner of interesting oddities to see.<br />
<br />
I did indeed finish the game on that long-ago rental, surprising myself.  In this, <i>Super Metroid</i> became a gateway game to other open ended gaming experiences.  Afterward, I bought my first <i>Zelda</i> game (<i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link the the Past</i>) and tried my first RPG (<i>Chrono Trigger</i>).  I bought <i>Super Metroid</i> and have since that time played it again and again, and I'm still finding things I hadn't seen before.<br />
<br />
<i>Super Metroid</i> was one of the largest games Nintendo had developed for the SNES.  It was ambitious, meticulously crafted, thoughtfully designed, and universally praised.  In other words, it was one tough act to follow.  It set the bar so high that every <i>Metroid</i> since has been measured by <i>Super</i>'s yardstick.  While it's good to have lofty goals, the downside of <i>Super Metroid</i>'s influence is a stifling of further experimentation&mdash;<i>Super</i> was "perfect," and it can be hard to move away from that when fans judge new additions to the series by how they compare to this singular game.<br />
<br />
Still, the series has continued to grow and evolve, and that is the secret to long term success; not an endless return to the <i>Super Metroid</i> formula, but a willingness to risk the new ideas.  This willingness has kept the <i>Metroid</i> series fresh and enjoyable.  <i>Super Metroid</i> continues to send ripples through the series&mdash;its influence will always be present&mdash;but <i>Metroid</i> moves forward as it should, even if each step does not result in a game as profound as <i>Super Metroid</i>.
