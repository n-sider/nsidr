<i>William Stevens III's Journal<br />
February 22, 2010</i><br />
<br />
I went and saw my niece the other day; she was, as is her wont, sporting a <i>Finding Nemo</i> t-shirt once again.  I was reminded of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/endless-ocean-the-journal-aquatic-day-1">my earlier failure</a> to secure a Dory fish for her for a present, and I thought, hey... am I William Stevens the Third or what?  I'll go get one myself, without anyone around to interfere.<br />
<br />
So, after the sun went down last night, to minimize my chances of running into someone else, I returned to the vicinity of the area where I'd seen those little fish last.  What I wasn't counting on was how murky the water was at night.<br />
<br />

<br />
But, an impossibly cool uncle's gotta do what an impossibly cool uncle's gotta do, right?  So I set off.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I pretty quickly found out that I was sort of out of my element in this murk, particularly without a guide in tow.  I couldn't find the spot where we'd seen those blue guys at all.  I swam around what felt like the entirety of Gatama Atoll looking for them, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
I was a little startled when I ran into these fish here.  I don't know what they're called, but they caught my dive light and reflected it back in a really eerie way.<br />

<br />
I saw a number of pretty cool rock-and-plant formations down in those shallow waters.  This one was really sweet; I would love to have a fountain that looked like this in my atrium.<br />

<br />
I had to include this shot, too... I was in this area with a couple rays like this guy here, but for some reason this dolphin was hanging around too.  I don't know if he wanted to be my friend, or what (and I'd forgotten the food I brought last time)... but he definitely wanted to nose in on my picture.<br />

<br />
What I wasn't expecting to find was this behemoth, here.  I had found an area that kind of <i>looked</i> like the place I'd last seen the Dory-fish, but the little blue gals weren't there... but this guy right here was.  This one, I could identify, an ocean sunfish&mdash;but I'd never seen one this gold color before.  The guy almost looked like a living statue.  Pretty stunning.<br />

<br />
Still a little geeked from my find but starting get exhausted from swimming all over looking for my niece's present, I finally gave in, surfaced, and stomped up a beach to sit down and rest for awhile. <br />
<br />
This little guy came up to me, and I found myself wondering if my niece might like a lizard for a pet... then I remembered my sister getting freaked out about my own pet lizards as a kid, and decided it might not have been such a good idea.<br />
<br />

<br />
But Stan and I (he looks like a Stan, doesn't he?) still kicked back for awhile on that beach to watch the colors in the early-evening skies.  (I offered him a beer; he declined.)<br />

<br />
Beautiful stuff.
