This staple Capcom RPG originally appeared on the Super NES. The series has gathered a decent following and has received sequels on the SNES and PlayStation game console.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/breathoffiregba02.jpg" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="left" width="190" height="121">This classic turn based RPG has received some improvements on the Game Boy Advance. Capcom has completely redone the graphic engine, recomposed the soundtrack, added cinema scenes and added communication-link support in which you can trade items with other players. Capcom hopes to release this game worldwide sometime between summer and fall 2001.</p>
