In this one you hold the controller like it is a light paintbrush, and you are painting with grace like an elegant artist.  You are so distinguished!<br />
<br />
The primary minigame involves "pushing" grandma's dentures into her face.  Her gums ache for sweet Fixodent.  It's sort of like holding a dart, and then you throw it at grandma's mouth, and really hope it doesn't hit her in the eyes.  Once grandma has teeth she can eat again, and then you win!<br />

In this one you hold the controller like you did when you were first learning how to drive and the driver's ed teacher was like "NINE O'CLOCK AND THREE O'CLOCK! BOTH HANDS, MISTER," a steering wheel, with the buttons facing you and a hand on each side. <br />
<br />
The main minigame involves assuming the position of a surly, 1980's limodriver who is presumably trying hard to acquire his chauffer's license.  Guide him along the turns and there's a bottle of Jim Beam in your future!  The other game from this position is definitely the best game that was in the demo.  Here, there is a hapless person standing in a vast expanse, facing you with their hands out, as if to say "please, no!"  Your mission is to thrust the remote forward in a haggard display of defiance, slamming them to the ground.  <br />

In this pose, you pretend you are garbed in red fishscale armor and are prepared to fight giant crabs in feudal Japan.  Hold the remote at your side like a sheathed sword.  Do you feel it?  The honor, I mean?  <br />
<br />
The game involves you quickly pulling it out to slash in an upswing angle.  You will cut apart such amazing things like oil-drums.  They stood against the emperor and must be destroyed.
