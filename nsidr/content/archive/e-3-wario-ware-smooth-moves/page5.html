This position involves you holding the remote ever so daintily on the end, like a piece of sushi or a little bite-sized tart.  You could just pop it into your mouth!<br />
<br />
But you will not, because the primary game here is turning a skeleton key in a lock.  This will open the door that leads you to exquisite riches and the confused family wondering how you got in.<br />

As you can see, the minigames and positions available in the E3 demo are entertaining and varied.  As usual, the graphical style is as humorous as it has ever been, and the context of the games is completely bizarre.  At one point I finished a game early only to have a totally unrelated cutscene of an elephant pulling a t-shirt over a boy's head greet me.  In another situation, I had just finished slamming a person to the ground defiantly when a brash, full-screen photograph of a goat appeared for a second or two.  This bodes well for my enjoyment of the title.<br />
<br />
In a totally worthless interview with IGN, home of hard-hitting interview questions like "Will you need to have the Wii sensor bar to play Prime 3," series creator Goro Abe said that the number of minigames will be close to the other titles in the series, around 200.  In a shocking twist, the game will also contain no online mode and (conditionally) a "multiplayer mode."  Said Abe: <br />
<br />
<div class="quote">"[WarioWare has multiplayer] because... one player [is] playing the game and the other people [are] being entertained by looking at that person.  Then we would like to have a mode where we will have one remote, but it will be passed onto the next player and they will race their micro-game times. And another plan we have is to connect the nunchuck to the Wii remote and have one player hold onto the Wii remote and the other the nunchuck, and cooperate to proceed through the game."</div><br />
Oh Abe, you spinster.  Why aren't you on Nintendo's PR team?  Abe also confirmed that the game will take advantage of the Wii remote's built-in speaker to offer sound feedback and games where the player must react to some kind of signal or sound before proceeding.  Set your hearing aids to max!  The game is on track for "launch window," but Abe said that it is a secret how they are doing with development.  One thing is certain: it will definitely be "sold within the first 90 days" of the Wii launch.<br />
<br />
I leave you with some final words of Abe-sight: "This game includes lots of dynamic movements and it's a little bit embarrassing to play it, but please don't be embarrassed.  Invite a bunch of friends to your room, throw away your embarrassment and make your best move. I would like everyone to be entertained!"<br />
<br />
So would we, Abe.  So would we.
