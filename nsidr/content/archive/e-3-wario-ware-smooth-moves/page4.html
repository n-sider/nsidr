In the remote control you assume the role of a zombie-like child attempting to switch channels from Yugioh to Digimon.  In a manner of speaking, you hold it like a "television remote."  You are so worldly!<br />
<br />
There are many games played from this position.  In one you are holding a fencing sword and must orient yourself to stab a melon that is being flung at you from a distance.  In another you pretend to be Emeril Lagasse, and you flip the remote repeatedly to toss vegetables in a pan and saute them for little Shelley who is anxiously awaiting her only meal of the week.  Still a third game has you sliding a tennis racket from left to right to make sure a tennis ball keeps bouncing, and in a fourth game you have to cut a little box free of the rest of the screen, kind of like that level in <i>Goldeneye</i> with the laser watch and the little brackets on the plate in the floor at the end of the train and Natalya is trying to crack the code that you sit on it but can't take it with you but she can't remember it's "chair" or something?  It's like that. <br />

<div class="header">The Umbrella</div><br />

Hold it like you would an umbrella, at your shoulder, as though the rod extends from it behind you.  If you really want to, you can even spin it and recall dandy times.<br />
<br />
As with The Remote Control position, The Umbrella offers several different minigames.  In one, you hold it like a track-and-field relay wand and you "run" by moving your arms up and down really fast.  In a second game, the goal is to "whip it good" at a little man on the screen who is covered in bugs.  You will whip the bugs right off of him!  A final game has you swatting little flying insects on a table, a delightful reminder of that game from <i>Mario Paint</i> which you probably spent more time playing than you did finding new ways to animate Mario getting slaughtered.<br />

Hold it in one hand, at the base, like you're pumping iron to get huge for the summer.  Can you feel the burn?<br />
<br />
Curling the remote up is one of the minigames here.  You curl the intense weight of the dumbbell up towards your throbbing bicep.  Once you have done it a few times, you win and are ready to attend the annual "Red, White, and Huge" competition down at the park.
