<p>The year is <b>2064</b>.



<p>You've just come home from an exhausting day at work.  As you reach the door of your quaint 



suburban apartment, you smile and say <i>"Hello"</i> to your neighbor as she walks past you in the 



hallway.  Your door unlocks upon identifying you via a retinal scanner.  You enter your home and 



duly mutter <i>"lights on"</i>.  As the warmth of glowing lights fills the room, you slump into 



your living room sofa.

  

<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/futuretelevision.jpg" width="224" height="280"></center>



<p>You yawn, picking up the remote controller lying beside you.  Switching on the screen, you begin 



to browse the various channels on your recently purchased <i>MSN Viro</i>.  You abruptly stop as a 



commercial catches your eye.  



<p><i>"Mmm,"</i> you lick your lips as Sara Lee advertises her new insta-bake "Homemade Apple Pie". 



 



<p>The next commercial flashes onto the screen featuring Honda's new hydro-fuel "environmentally 



safe" vehicle called the "Aqua".  You stick your tongue out, thinking to yourself how much more 



attractive your teal car looks compared to the chartreuse one shown in the commercial. 



<p>Your eyes widen as the next commercial exclaims, <i>"Stay tuned for the 1,500th episode of 



'Friends'!"</i>  You sigh with disgust, grabbing the MSN Viro remote controller in your hands and 



selecting the "Game Mode". (MSN Viro is also known as the 



<b>M</b>icrosoft-<b>S</b>ony-<b>N</b>intendo En<b>viro</b>nment).  Your remote controller acts as a 



wireless game controller.



<p>A large screen pops up listing the latest video game releases.  You see a new game that fancies 



a look called <i>The Legend of Zelda: Fallen Hero</i>.  You press "enter".  A screen suddenly pops 



up requesting you to "Please wait while game downloads".  A minute later the download stream has 



completed.  Nintendo's logo flashes, whereupon a screen with bright colors displays a logo for 



<i>The Legend of Zelda: Fallen Hero</i>.  A familiar tune you recall as a child plays in the 



background.



<p>As you start up the game, you see a short clip introducing the game's story.  A deep wispy 



voice begins, "Many hundreds of years ago, there lived a hero in a land covered in a deep blue sea. 



 One day, however, this hero fell into the sea and was lost to its depths..."



<p>The camera zooms around and you see a young man peering out his window into the twilight.  



Taking control of the character, you look around his home.  He doesn't appear to be well off.  



There is only but a bed, chair and a small picture framing a beautiful young blond woman.



<p>You open his door and peer outside. Across the way is a house with flickering lights.  You 



briskly walk over, knock on the door and enter.  There is a woman inside staring at a lighted 



television.  You walk up to her and hesitantly speak.  She shrieks, <i>"Leave me alone, the 1,500th 



episode of Friends is on!"</i>  You sigh, and take your character outside.



<p>To your right is another home.  It's a little larger than the last.  You enter and find it to be 



filled with a variety of furniture.  There's a bedroom, bathroom, and even a kitchen.  It appears 



oddly quite and that no one is home.  Filled with curiosity, however, you sneak into the kitchen.  



You open the refrigerator and peer inside.  You see a box and carefully examine it.  In bolded 



letters it says "Sara Lee's insta-bake Homemade Apple Pie".  



<p>Despite your real-life stomach telling you to put the silly video game down, you decide to play 



10 more minutes.



<p>The sun has just about set in the land of Hyrule.  You walk past your house and down to the 



large lake.  A gust of wind whips at your hair as you reach the water's edge.  Out of the corner of 



your eye, you notice writing in the sand.  This strikes you as odd and upon closer inspection you 



see it says "Honda Aqua".  You pull out your sword and swipe it away leaving only the first two 



letters "Ho".  You laugh at your small accomplishment.



<p>Suddenly, you pause the video game and think about what just happened.



<p><center>---------------</center>



<p>What did just happen?  Is this a plausible future for you and me?  



<p>Maybe.  Or maybe not.  



<p>Whatever the case, it appears to be the direction the industry is heading right now.



<p>If you would have asked me a couple years ago whether or not an "average" game such as <i>Enter 



the Matrix</i> could be released and attain such tremendous success, I might have been hesitant to 



say yes.  Today, an answer would be obvious.



<p>For those unaware, the producers of The Matrix partnered with Coca-Cola to co-sponsor both the 



sale of its Powerade sports drink as well as promote the Matrix movie and video game.  In fact, 



some of you may have noticed the Powerade vending machines meticulously located in various 



locations of the <i>Enter the Matrix</i> video game.



<p>It's a guarantee this trend will only continue and even pick up momentum.



<p>It's not that difficult to see video games - in 50 years - being the free entertainment that 



television is today.  Advertising and commercials have paved the way for public television and may 



very well pave the way for public video gaming.  Although this sort of product placement may sound 



far-fetched, the convergence of entertainment is not.



<p>Microsoft and Sony are all about the convergence of multimedia devices.  Some also refer to 



their devices as a "Trojan Horse".  



<p>The term "Trojan Horse" comes from a story in Homer's Iliad, in which the Greeks gave a giant 



wooden horse to their foes, the Trojans, ostensibly as a peace offering. After the Trojans dragged 



the horse inside their city walls, Greek soldiers snuck out of the horse's hollow belly and opened 



the city gates, allowing their compatriots to pour in and capture Troy. 



<p>This is essentially Microsoft and Sony's goal.  They want to capture and moreover, control your 



living room entertainment center, from the electronic devices all the way down to the code that 



runs it.  And if Nintendo wants to stay competitive, it has no choice but to have the same goal 



(whether it decides to go it alone or with Matsushita is yet unknown).  



<p>Thus, in our imaginary story, 2064 sees the introduction of the MSN Viro.



<p>Don't assume the "Trojan Horse" is just fairy tale. Sony has already initiated the inevitable.  



Sony recently announced its remodeled PlayStation 2 called the PSX.  This system will feature the 



ability to play existing PlayStation 2 software, as well feature a personal video recorder (PVR), 



satellite tuner, 120GB hard drive, and DVDRW/-R functionality.  So conceivably, the PSX will be 



the center of a home network that allows you to stream pictures, audio, and video throughout your 



house. Analysts predict this is Sony's "testing of the waters" before its debut of PlayStation 3.



<p>And if that's not enough, take a look at how much Sony and Microsoft are pushing online gaming.  



Microsoft especially is touting online gaming as the be-all end-all of gaming.



<p>Do you need another example, perhaps one more closer to home?  How about Nintendo's GameCube + 



Game Boy Advance connectivity?  Is it impossible to conceive a time when Nintendo's home console 



and portable will be one and the same?  It's the way things are currently heading.  You already 



play your Game Boy Player on a television and your Game Boy Advance SP on the go.



<p>Also, don't forget Nintendo and AM3's E3 announcement regarding the Game Boy Advance.  AM3 Inc. 



will be creating a dedicated adapter for the Game Boy Advance and SmartMedia memory cards that will 



provide full motion video play on the Game Boy Advance handheld. Various developers including 



Majesco and 4 Kids Entertainment are providing "video paks" to use with the system that will allow 



40 minutes of full motion video or cartoons - including <i>Pokemon, Kirby,</i> and <i>Teenage 



Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>.



<p>Then there's Sony's recently announced handheld which will feature, among other things, the 



ability to listen to music and watch movies.  There's even a good possibility developers will 



release software for users to access the internet, download and read full length books, and more.



<p>Both Sony and Microsoft have alluded that their future consoles will be more than gaming 



devices.  It is only a matter of time.



<p>One can't predict the future with 100 percent accuracy but if things continue on the path they 



are now, you'll be listening to music, watching television, and playing games on a single device.  



One question I posed earlier is who will be the manufacturer of this device?  Will it be Sony or 



Microsoft or Nintendo or perhaps a collaboration between them all?  That is even less known.



<p>Nevertheless, it's an interesting thought.  Especially since much of us are young enough to be an 



audience of this gradual evolution of the home entertainment center.



<p>End.
