<font size="1">Future Potential: Good</font></center>

<p>On September 24, 2002, one of the most stunning announcements ever made, concluded with the pop of a champagne cork.  Once upon a time, <a href="http://www.squaresoft.com">Square</a> developed some of its finest RPGs for Nintendo consoles. However, due to the competitive nature of the industry and a fallout between the company leaders, Square left to develop for Sony's disc-based console.

<p>In March 2002, a revival of this once magical relationship occured between Square and Nintendo. It was announced that Nintendo would loan Square money from Yamauchi's Q Fund to start a new development house called Game Designer's Studio. In return, the new studio would develop an exclusive <i>Final Fantasy</i> title for GameCube and Game Boy Advance.  Game Designer's Studio is headed up by Square director Akitoshi Kawazu, who previously worked on <i>Legend of Mana Two</i>.  The two versions of <i>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicle</i>, as the game is now named, are said to heavily utilize the link-up feature between the GameCube and Game Boy Advance.

<p>Also, as a result of the rekindling of this relationship, Square has revived development for the Game Boy Advance.  A sequel to <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i> and <i>Secret of Mana</i> are in development.

<p>What was believed to never again be...will be.

<p>Nintendo and Tomy formed an alliance on December 30, 2002. It was announced that Nintendo will market and distribute games developed by toy-maker Tomy in Japan starting in the Spring. 

<p>Tokyo-based Tomy is currently in development with three games for GameCube, <i>Mutsu to no Hohon</i>, <i>Zoids VS</i> and <i>Naruto</i>. Tomy is also developing seven titles for Game Boy Advance - including <i>Little Buster Q</i>. Nintendo will sell Tomy's ninja-fighting game called Naruto this spring. This is the GameCube title, for those unaware, which inspired a comic that many labeled as "megaton".  There is currently no word on stateside releases for Tomy's software. 

<p>Nintendo of America would be wise in releasing Naruto.  A fighting game would do well to strengthen the GameCube's image.

<p>In early 2002, Skip Ltd. announced the development of its cel-shaded RPG, <i>Giftpia</i>.  <i>Giftpia</i> is directed by a former Square employee, Kenichi Nishi, and designed by Keita Eto. Nishi and Eto were involved in the creation of the exceptional SNES RPG, <i>Chrono Trigger</i>. Skip hopes to add innovation to both the RPG and communication genres.

<p>Giftpia is currently scheduled for release in Japan in April 2003.  With the success of <i>Animal Crossing</i> in North America, there is a good chance Nintendo of America will bring the title over.
