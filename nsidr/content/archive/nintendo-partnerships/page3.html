<p>Starfox isn't the only game <a href="http://www.namco.com">Namco</a> has in development for GameCube. Along with Nintendo and Namco's Triforce announcements, the two companies came to an agreement in which Nintendo would publish future Namco software titles to appear on the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance systems. A total of six Namco Nintendo GameCube titles are slated for release on the Nintendo GameCube by the end of 2003 and beginning of 2004, including the highly acclaimed sequel to Soul Calibur and the Ridge Racer series. Additionally, eight Namco titles are scheduled to appear on the Game Boy Advance within 2002 and '03.

<p>If you don't believe the significance of this announcement, simply look at the following example.  Nintendo's Link from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> will appear as a fighter in Namco's <i>Soul Calibur II</i> releasing on August 19, 2003.

<p>Look for Namco's generous support to continue at the May Electronic Entertainment Expo.

<p>This venerated group of ex-Konami employees is well respected for producing titles with solid control, complex play mechanics, stunning graphics and a high degree of difficulty and replay value.  The only Nintendo 64 game from <a href="http://www.treasure-inc.co.jp">Treasure</a> that ever came to the United States was Mischief Makers; a quirky 2-D platformer released back in late 1997.  Nevertheless, Nintendo and Treasure have had a close relationship for many years.  The two companies collaborated on <i>Sin and Punishment: Successor of Earth</i> released only in Japan.

<p>Treasure recently released <i>Ikaruga</i> for GameCube under publisher Infogrames. Treasure is currently rumored to be developing the GameCube game <i>Wario World</i> to be released on May 26, 2003.

<p><a href="http://www.geniussonority.co.jp/">Genius Sonority</a> is an obscure Japanese development house, founded in June 2002. Created with financial support of Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, Genius Sonority is made up of programmers who worked on such high profile RPGs as Dragon Quest and Earthbound.  

<p>Rumors suggest the company is in development with a game based on the Pokemon franchise.  Since there is no basis for the truth within these rumors, they are probably best treated as speculation.
