<p>On February 28, 2003, <a href="http://www.konami.com">Konami</a> Entertainment announced it was in development with a <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> title for the Nintendo GameCube. 

<p>It's unknown if the GameCube version of Metal Gear Solid will be a completely new title in the series or rather a port of the already-released <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> for PlayStation or <i>Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty</i> for PlayStation 2. 

<p>Message board posts at Konami USA's website have said that the publisher will show off some of its bigger franchises for GameCube at the Electronics Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles this May.

<p><i>Metal Gear Solid</i> is tentatively scheduled for a Q4 2003 release.

<p>Konami is an important ally for Nintendo to have back on board.

<p>On March 6, 2003 came one of the most recent, yet nevertheless, largest partnerships.

<p>Nintendo and <a href="http://www.ea.com">Electronic Arts</a> announced a collaboration on multiple games that will include exclusive features for connected play between the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance.  
<p>Games will be developed by EA, with Nintendo game producer, Shigeru Miyamoto, providing input on technical game play elements.

<p>The first three EA titles to support connectivity between the two systems will be <i>FIFA 2004, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2004</i> and <i>Madden NFL 2004</i>. <i>FIFA 2004</i> will be available on both systems when the game launches in Europe this autumn and <i>Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2004</i> is scheduled for launch in October. <i>Madden NFL 2004</i> will launch on the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance simultaneously in August.  Over the next 12 months, EA plans to introduce approximately 20 Nintendo GameCube titles from their EA Sports, EA Games, and EA Sports Big brands.  Some of the additional Nintendo GameCube titles are also expected to support connectivity with Game Boy Advance.

<p>It seems a common theme with many of these partnerships is the connectivity between GBA and GCN.  Nintendo has recognized the fact that it can't do it alone and that gathering new ideas is the only way.

<p>In early April, From Software announced a publishing agreement with Nintendo Co. Ltd for future GameCube software.  The first game to come from the agreement is <i>Lost Kingdoms II</i>. Nintendo will act as a publisher for the title in Japan, but help strictly in promotional ways with sales, distribution, and business with retailers. <i>Lost Kingdoms II</i> is scheduled for release in the North America and Japan in May.

<p>From Software is known for its action RPGs.  In addition to <i>Lost Kingdoms II</i>, From Software is also developing <i>Gold Star Mountain</i> for GameCube.  From Software's games have a good chance of arriving on the shores of North America.

<p>Nintendo's relationship with game developers is deeper than most could imagine.  They have studio partnerships covering the globe composed of the most talented, imaginative, and hard-working individuals available in the industry. When was the last time you could play Mario, Final Fantasy, F-Zero, Star Fox, Resident Evil, Metal Gear, and Pokemon all on a single console?  Nintendo has truly returned gaming to its glory days.

<p> Nintendo has supported these companies with its assets and ideas, allowing the industry as a whole to prosper and constantly evolve.  These are the developers of the future - Nintendo's friends, colleagues, and acquaintances.  They're all here and they're prepared to take the reins of this next-generation of video games.</p>
