In <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/games/ps3/0,239035763,339281194,00.htm">an interview</a> with CNET, RedOctane cofounder and chief operating officer Charles Huang had a few words to say about an unlikely entry in the Guitar Hero franchise: <i>Guitar Hero III</i> for Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
Huang says RedOctane is "hoping to really bring the experience to the DS and to do some very, very different approaches" with the title.   Asked about the possibility of a DS peripheral, Huang replied, "That is definitely one of the options we're exploring. The DS peripheral is very intriguing to us. It's an integral part of the Guitar Hero experience, so as much as possible, we would like to keep it within the experience as long as it makes sense and it plays well. And we can do it on the DS where it not only makes sense for the title, but also for the way people like to interact with the DS. It needs to be affordable and it needs to fit within the environment that people normally play DS games in, but central to it all, we are exploring ways to get peripherals on a DS game."
