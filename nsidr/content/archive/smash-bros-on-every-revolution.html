Nintendo needs to bundle the new <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> game with the Nintendo Revolution console.<br><br>

You're probably asking, "Why should Nintendo pass up on millions of possible sales of a $50 game?"  Because they'll be assured of many millions of additional sales through the promotion of Nintendo characters.  Super Smash Bros. stands as a great game by itself, however it is also an incredible advertisement for Nintendo's game series -- from Zelda, to Metroid, to Mr. Game & Watch.  For instance, many players were first introduced to Fire Emblem's Marth and Roy in Super Smash Bros. Melee and the result was great interest in the Game Boy Advance and recent GameCube releases of the series.  Why not use Smash Bros. as an avenue to introduce players to more Nintendo characters?<br><br>

The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection has great potential.  Through this service, Nintendo will be able to add additional characters to the Smash Bros. fighting line-up.  If Nintendo releases a new franchise two years after the arrival of Smash Bros. Revolution, it can still include a new character through a simple download; the game will provide an opportunity to introduce this new character to players and potentially incite them to purchase the new game.  The hesitations that go along with buying something "new" are somewhat alleviated.<br><br>
