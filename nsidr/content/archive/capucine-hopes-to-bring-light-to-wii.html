A group of students at French game development school Supinfogame have announced their intent to bring a new title to Wii.  <i>Capucine</i> is described as an exploration and adventure game enhanced by a story of opposing light and shadow and the revival of a world.  This game takes place in a universe where everything is dead. The player controls a child who holds a "capucine", a magical flower of light that she must use to interact with her surroundings.  However, be careful not to animate the shadows who will try to steal the flower and prevent the beautiful heroine from fulfilling her quest.<br />

Capucine is currently being built for the PC with cryENGINE 1, the graphics engine that the original Far Cry ran on. The team is composed of a group of 10 students who hope to eventually develop the game for Wii.
