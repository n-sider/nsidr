<p>Nintendo's series of simple Game Boy Advance games, bit Generations (previously <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1988">on display at Shibuya Parco</a>), is set for release in July in Japan, and the company is giving 700 Club Nintendo members the chance to test-drive the titles this month.</p>

<p>GameSpot reports that <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6152192.html">entries are accepted</a> through June 15.  Club Nintendo membership is, unfortunately, only available to customers in Japan.  The bit Generations series were <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1024">once referred to as Digitylish</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1828">later Digiluxe</a>, as Nintendo seemed to be entertaining the possibility of release in the US &mdash; perhaps they yet will, if the series proves its mettle in Japan.</p>
