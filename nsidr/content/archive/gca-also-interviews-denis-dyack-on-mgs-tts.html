<p>It seems Mr. Dyack is in an interviewing mood lately, as GameCube Advanced (GCA) recently had the opportunity to chat with him as well. Though not without a few repeat questions from Planet GameCube interview (posted earlier today), much of the article is worth a read. 

<p>Below is a highlight from the interview:

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: In <i>Eternal Darkness</i>, the first title that you did since signing on with Nintendo, you mentioned Mr. Miyamoto was a big influence to you. Now that you have been working closely with Hideo Kojima as well as studying his work and story telling process, how has he influenced you in your game creation? How do you feel you influenced them?</b></font>

<blockquote><p><b>Denis Dyack: </b> Kojima-san, like Miyamoto-san, is a master game creator. However, his style is very difference from Miyamoto-sans. We have learned much through the collaboration with Kojima-san's group. Comparing Twin Snakes to <i>Eternal Darkness</i> is like comparing a Hollywood movie to Independent film. Although <i>Eternal Darkness</i> was very critically acclaimed it required the player to be patient to see its true quality. In comparison, both MGS 1 and MGS 2 capture the attention of the player immediately. The ways in which Kojima-san's group creates such high production level in games is truly impressive. For example, I still remember the satisfying sensation of thinking; gamers are going to love this when seeing some of the cinematics running in Twin Snakes the first time. Silicon Knights really has been given a unique and rare opportunity to work some of the most influential creators in the gaming industry. These experiences have changed us dramatically. I think we have influenced them in some way as well but that question is best answered by Kojima-san and his group.</p></blockquote>
