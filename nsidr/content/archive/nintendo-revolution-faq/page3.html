<center><h3>Revolution First-Party Support</h3></center>

<p>Nintendo's first-party and funded studios are the crme de la crme of this industry.  Nintendo has a wealth of talent, all of which have already or will eventually make the transition to Revolution development.  Here's a summary of those companies and the style of games we can anticipate from them.</p>

<p><blockquote><hr></blockquote></p>

<p>Nintendo's worldwide offices house some 3,000 employees, more than 850 of which are directly involved in game development.  Nintendo recently restructured its Japanese development studios and so the delineation between the old and new development groups have been altered.</p>

<p>Since May 2002, after <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=382">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> departed from his position of nearly 50 years as Nintendo's president, Nintendo and its new leader <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> have been evaluating the transition it must make in the 21st century to satisfy its consumer base all the while attracting first-time customers. Specifically, Nintendo has taken a big step in preparing its development groups in loom of maximizing production and innovation for the Nintendo Revolution and Nintendo DS. The past few years have seen Nintendo president Satoru Iwata conducting many experiments by rearranging and forming several new divisions. The last major Nintendo restructure in early 2000 consisted of dividing Nintendo development groups into six divisions:</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b><u>Past Structure</u></b></font></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nintendo Research & Development 1</b> (R&D1)
<li><b>Nintendo Research & Development 2</b> (R&D1)
<li><b>Nintendo Integrated Research & Development</b> (IRD)
<li><b>Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development</b> (EAD)
<li><b>Nintendo Special-Planning & Development</b> (SP&D)
<li><b>Nintendo Research & Engineering</b> (R&E)
  </ul>

<p>Although there were six full and capable divisions, the ratio of staff heavily favored general manager <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> and deputy manager <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=341">Takashi Tezuka's</a> Nintendo EAD group.</p>

<p>Satoru Iwata has completely reorganized these development groups within Nintendo. Following the trend of allocating more and more resources behind Shigeru Miyamoto's EAD group, Nintendo has finally decided to merge all its software designers under the EAD division. As of 2005, Nintendo's divisions are composed of the following:</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b><u>Present Structure</u></b></font></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Nintendo Integrated Research & Development</b>
<li><b>Nintendo Technology & Engineering</b>
<li><b>Nintendo Software Planning Development</b>
<li><b>Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development</b>
<li><b>Nintendo Licensing Business</b>
  </ul>

<p>Nintendo R&D1, Nintendo R&D2, and Nintendo-Special Planning & Development no longer exist. For the most part Nintendo has extracted all of the software designers of those three divisions, blended them with the EAD group, and has now divided EAD into several different sectors.  Nintendo Technology & Development is a mix of the hardware side of Nintendo R&D2 combined with Nintendo R&E while Nintendo Software Production & Development is a new division made for overseas production of first-party software with subsidiary and partnered development groups such as Retro Studios, Kuju Entertainment, and n-Space.</p>

<p>Shigeru Miyamoto remains the general manager and Takashi Tezuka the deputy manager of Nintendo EAD. However, the once centralized group has now been divided into subdivisions, each with individualized managers and producers. While the exact subdivisions have not been announced, we have some information on six of these teams:</p>

<p>Satoru Iwata has been preparing for this restructure for over a year. Iwata initially relieved Shigeru Miyamoto of producing overseas titles by creating Nintendo Software Production & Development under Akita Ootani. Nintendo also promoted several long-time EAD directors to producer roles -- the list of which includes Eiji Aonuma, Hideki Konno, Tadashi Sugiyama, Takao Shimizu, and Shinya Takahashi. Shigeru Miyamoto now completely manages all of Nintendo's internal software development, granting him access to the Metroid and Wario franchises for the first time. The change ultimately bodes well for Nintendo's big picture as far as creativity and productivity are concerned. Nevertheless, many mysteries remain such as the location of the Metroid team and the Wario Ware team.</p>

<p><i>Below is a list of all Nintendo internal and subsidiary companies involved in either software or hardware development.</i></p>

The iRD division also developed and co-developed the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo 64, Nintendo 64DD, GameCube Link Cable, GameCube Modem, GameCube Controller, Nintendo 64 Controller, and N64 Controller Pack. You can expect iRD is partially or fully involved in the development of the Revolution hardware. Notable past titles include Punch-Out (Arcade), Super Punch-Out!! (SNES), Pro-Wrestling (NES), Star Tropics (NES), and NES Play Action Football (NES).</p>

<p>This division is composed of a new set of producers.  It was created by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in order to free up Shigeru Miyamoto and other NCL producers from having to fly oversees to work with American and European developers creating first-party products for Nintendo.  These producers have worked with companies such as Retro Studios, Silicon Knights and more.  With the recent 2005 restructure, this division has been drastically expanded and is now capable of supporting dozens of collaborative titles from around the world.  Notable past titles include Metroid Prime 2 (GCN), Geist (GCN), and Advance Wars: Under Fire (GCN).</p>

<p>EAD is probably the most popular and well-known division at Nintendo as it houses legendary Mario and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto.

As a result of the 2005 restructure, the majority of game development occurs in this division.  This even includes the recently formed EAD Tokyo studio that Nintendo hopes will create some very innovative and fresh titles. <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=124">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=282">Takao Shimizu</a>, who worked on Super Mario Sunshine as director and assistant director respectively, head Nintendo's Tokyo studio.
