                  <H3>Revolution Third-Party Support</H3></CENTER>
                  <P>In contrast to prior generations, Nintendo has foregone its 
                  "Dream Team" of second-party developers for Revolution in 
                  favor of creating relationships with proven third-party 
                  studios. Nintendo has realized that third-party developers are 
                  the peanut butter that bind the bread together.</P>
                  <P>This wasn't an overnight snap of the fingers - although it 
                  has definitely been an amusing makeover event. Rather, this 
                  has been an ever-ongoing process that only truly began to pick 
                  up some momentum this generation with the GameCube and more 
                  specifically, with Satoru Iwata being named Hiroshi Yamauchi's 
                  replacement as president of Nintendo Co., Ltd. Beginning in 
                  2002, Iwata has set out to heal many of the scars that existed 
                  from Nintendo's prior reign; with that healing, he has since 
                  created an atmosphere of respect.</P>
                  <P>On an ever growing scale, Nintendo has been funding, 
                  aiding, and conceiving new gaming experiences through the 
                  talent and ingenuity of third-party developers and publishers. 
                  Each alliance that is formed helps to provide a mosaic of the 
                  Nintendo we know today.</P>
                  <P>Over the past few years Nintendo has supported these 
                  companies with its assets and ideas, allowing the industry as 
                  a whole to prosper and constantly evolve. These are the 
                  developers of the future - Nintendo's friends, colleagues, and 
                  acquaintances. They're all here and they're prepared to take 
                  the reins of this next-generation of video games.</P>

                  <P>Activision is known for its <i>Tony Hawk</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i> licensed games.  The studio has put heavy support behind all of Nintendo's consoles in the past and so there's no reason to think differently in regards to its Revolution support.  The studio is very platform agnostic and instead tends to develop its titles for multiplatform release.  This strategy can be expected to continue in the future.  The publisher has several appealing franchises including the GTA-like <i>True Crime</i> and war-hero series <i>Call of Duty</i>. "What we're seeing from this controller is the same thing we saw with Nintendo DS," said Chuck Huebner, Head of Worldwide Studios, Activision in response to the Revolution controller's unveiling. "It's a system that's designed with an eye on enticing new players to the video game industry, and that's something we firmly support." </P>

                  <P>On September 5, 2002 Bandai announced a partnership with 
                  Nintendo that would see the company developing GameCube 
                  software. Until then Bandai was only making games for its 
                  WonderSwan portable console and Playstation 2. Bandai is 
                  famous for its <I>Mobile Suit Gundam</I> and <I>Digimon</I> 
                  games. Bandai is currently the third largest toy company in 
                  the world, comprising 53 subsidiaries in 18 countries. Bandai 
                  is an exceptional partner for Nintendo to have on its side. 
                  Nintendo realizes this and has heavily invested in the 
                  company, causing many rumors in the industry to say that 
                  Nintendo would try to obtain a majority stake in the company. 
                  This has not, at least yet, been the case.</P>

                  <P>A press conference held in Japan on September 11, 2002, set 
                  the stage for the news, in which respected game designers 
                  Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Capcom's Shinji Mikami shook 
                  hands on an announcement that floored the gaming community. As 
                  a result of the partnership, remakes of Resident Evil 0, 
                  Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, 
                  Resident Evil: Code Veronica and Resident Evil 4 were all 
                  released exclusively on the GameCube. In addition, several 
                  other projects including <I>Product Number 03</I>, 
                  <I>Viewtiful Joe</I> and <I>Killer 7</I> were lined up for a 
                  GameCube release. Nintendo and Capcom clearly have a very 
                  close relationship as the companies also worked together on 
                  the Zelda Game Boy titles and even the most recent Kirby title 
                  for GBA, <I>Kirby &amp; The Amazing Mirror</I>. Capcom has 
                  several high-profiles series under its belt, with the most 
                  well-known being <I>Resident Evil</I>, <I>Devil May Cry</I>, 
                  <I>Mega Man</I> and <I>Street Fighter</I>.</P>

                  <P>On March 6, 2003 Nintendo and Electronic Arts announced a 
                  collaboration on multiple games that would include exclusive 
                  features for connected play between the Nintendo GameCube and 
                  Game Boy Advance. Games including titles such as Madden NFL 
                  2004 and The Sims were developed by EA, with Nintendo game 
                  producer, Shigeru Miyamoto, providing input on technical game 
                  play elements. Nintendo has built a close relationship with 
                  Electronic Arts and while Sega pulled its sports titles from 
                  the GameCube, EA continues to support the console. Being one 
                  of the world's largest publishers, it's very likely EA will 
                  have several Revolution titles cooking.  "Game control is essential - it's the area where perhaps the most game-play improvement can be made," said John Schappert, Sr. Vice President and General Manager of Electronic Arts Canada in response to the Revolution controller's unveiling. "While our portfolio represents a full array of titles across all genres, I think our sports titles might be the first to immediately take advantage of what this novel 'freehand' type of control has to offer." </P>

                  <P>Originally located in Cologne, Germany, Factor 5 was 
                  offered in 1995, due to close collaboration with LucasArts, a 
                  move to Northern California. In May 1996 the staff, consisting 
                  of 19 people (Among them developers, programmers, graphic 
                  artists and musicians), moved to San Rafael, CA (Marin 
                  County). Factor 5 first started developing titles for Lucas 
                  Arts on the PlayStation. However, it moved on and started 
                  toying with the Nintendo 64. Its first major endeavor would 
                  turn out to be a development necessity rather than a game; it 
                  decided to rewrite the Nintendo 64's sound tools and use its 
                  own proprietary sound tools titled MusyX and MORT. Nintendo 
                  has been very close with Factor 5. Factor 5 also created the 
                  sound tools for Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and the 
                  Nintendo GameCube. The company was one of the first developers 
                  to receive development kits for the GameCube, showing off its 
                  first GameCube title, <I>Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue 
                  Squadron II</I> at Nintendo's 2000 Spaceworld show. Most 
                  recently Factor 5, in collaboration with Lucas Arts, released 
                  <I>Star Wars Rogue Squadron III</I> during the 2003 holiday. 
                  At the 2003 E3 Expo, it was also all but confirmed that Factor 
                  5 was working on a <I>Pilotwings</I> sequel for GameCube. It's 
                  rumored however that the companies had a sort of falling out 
                  after the release of <I>Rogue Squadron III</I> and that 
                  <I>Pilotwings</I> is no longer in development. Recently the company pledged full support for the PlayStation 3.</P>

                  <P>On February 28, 2003, Konami Entertainment announced it was 
                  in development with a Metal Gear Solid title for the Nintendo 
                  GameCube. The title came via Nintendo's then funded developer 
                  Silicon Knights. Konami has since collaborated on a <I>Dance 
                  Dance Mario Revolution</I> title for the Nintendo GameCube. 
                  Konami has several important franchises under its belt 
                  including the <I>Silent Hill</I>, <I>Metal Gear Solid</I>, and 
                  <I>Castlevania</I> series. Konami is an important ally for 
                  Nintendo to have on its side -- especially for the titles that 
                  appeal to an older gamer.  Konami has said that it has an original title in development for the Revolution.  When Hideo Kojima, mastermind behind the Metal Gear Solid series saw the Revolution controller for the first time he said, ""You've done it! Even though it was a surprise to me at first, I quickly understood how it should be used. This is exactly what I was looking for."</P>

                  <P>Here's a studio that sort of came out of nowhere. Founded 
                  in 1994 and headquartered in Orlando, Florida, n-Space has 
                  developed a large portfolio of game titles in its lifetime for 
                  PC, Sony's PlayStation and PS2, and until recently Nintendo's 
                  GameCube. The supernatural GameCube first-person shooter known 
                  as <I>Geist</I> will likely be many gamer's first experience 
                  with the company. Depending on the success of <I>Geist</I>, 
                  Nintendo may request a sequel or even another original title

                  <P>Namco has gone from being anti-Nintendo during Yamauchi's 
                  reign, to pro-Nintendo and one of the company's largest 
                  GameCube supporters. The company's relationship has grown so 
                  strong in fact over just the past few years that the two 
                  companies have already collaboratively developed four titles - 
                  <I>Starfox</I>, <I>Mario Baseball</I> <I>Pac-Man vs.</I> and 
                  <I>Donkey Konga</I> for the Nintendo GameCube. Nintendo even 
                  recently allowed Namco to include its cherished Legend of 
                  Zelda character "Link" in <I>Soul Calibur II</I>. Namco has 
                  released several RPGs for the GameCube including <I>Tales of 
                  Symphonia</I> and <I>Baten Kaitos</I>. Beyond those titles, 
                  Namco has many other recognizable series including 
                  <I>Tekken</I>, <I>Ridge Racer</I>, <I>Klonoa</I> and <I>Time 
                  Crisis</I>. Namco is an exceptional ally with an 
                  ever-deepening relationship with Nintendo.</P>

                  Status</B>: Likely<BR></P>
                  <P>It's unknown how Sega will fare now that it has merged with 
                  Sammy. What we all hope however is that Sega will remain Sega. 
                  Sega has always been a company attracted to innovation and is 
                  someone who's filled with creators admired by Nintendo and 
                  vice versa. During this generation, Sega has been 
                  exceptionally successful on the GameCube platform with the 
                  release of <I>Super Monkey Ball</I>, <I>Phantasy Star 
                  Online</I> and <I>Sonic Adventure</I> (Sonic Adventure 2 for 
                  GameCube has been Sega's first and only platinum 
                  million-selling published title since it went third party). 
                  Nintendo also worked closely with Sega's Amuzement Vision 
                  studio to create <I>F-Zero GX</I>. It's very possible future 
                  collaborations are in store. Although Sega pulled its sports 
                  franchises from the GameCube, one hopes they will return with 
                  the coming generation and that Sega will make apt use of the 
                  Revolution's capabilities.</P>

                  <P>Silicon Knights was once a Nintendo funded studio -- but 
                  quickly became the last of its second-party studios after 
                  Nintendo decided that its short-term relationship with 
                  third-parties was more beneficial. After developing <I>Eternal 
                  Darkness</I> and then collaboratively developing <I>Metal Gear 
                  Solid Twin Snakes</I> with Konami, Nintendo ended its funding 
                  of the studio. SK president Denis Dyack said it's possible the two companies will still  collaborate in the future on a title-by-title basis.  The studio currently has no plans however as it is busy developing a title with Sega and a <i>Too Human</i> trilogy for Microsoft's next-generation console.</P>

                  <P>With the original Nintendo and Super Nintendo, Square and 
                  Enix were Nintendo's largest supporters. That is of course, 
                  until the less-costly and more freedom allowing disc-media of 
                  the PlayStation appeared. The two companies departed from 
                  Nintendo which led Yamauchi and Square in particular to have a 
                  distaste for each other. Fortunately, with the GameCube, the 
                  relationship with Square has been repaired. The two companies, 
                  courtesy of Yamauchi's personal Fund Q, have brought such 
                  titles as <I>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</I> and <I>Sword of 
                  Mana</I> to the Game Boy Advance and <I>Final Fantasy: Crystal 
                  Chronicles</I> to the GameCube. Square Enix is the ultimate 
                  RPG publisher in the world with such series as <I>Final 
                  Fantasy</I>, <I>Dragon Quest</I>, <I>Seiken Densetsu</I>, and 
                  much more -- and its support is vital in the Japanese 
                  market.  The studio has confirmed that they are in development with <i>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</i> for the Revolution.</P>

                  <P>"THQ" used to stand for Toy Head-Quarters, reflecting the Company's early focus as a toy manufacturer. However, since 1994 the Company has focused exclusively on the development and publishing of video games.  THQ confirmed during a year-end press event in September 2005 that it would fully support Nintendo's next-generation console with software.  THQ is known for its licensed software from Nickelodeon, Disney/Pixar, World Wrestling Entertainment, Scooby-Doo and original properties such as Full Spectrum Warrior and MX Unleashed.  The company has been a reliable supporter of all recent Nintendo platforms.  Nintendo's handhelds in particular are where a significant portion of the company's revenue is gained. "Nintendo has long been a trailblazer, and this controller design reinforces that reputation," said Brian Farrell, president and CEO of THQ in response to the Revolution controller's unveiling. "We enthusiastically support Nintendo's next console because we believe their approach of continual innovation is very much in line with our own strategy of creating unique and innovative games for the next generation of hardware."

                  <P>This venerated group of ex-Konami employees is well 
                  respected for producing titles with solid control, complex 
                  play mechanics, stunning graphics and a high degree of 
                  difficulty and replay value. The only Nintendo 64 game from 
                  Treasure that ever came to the United States was Mischief 
                  Makers; a quirky 2-D platformer released back in late 1997. 
                  Nevertheless, Nintendo and Treasure have had a close 
                  relationship for many years. The two companies collaborated on 
                  <I>Sin and Punishment: Successor of Earth</I> released only in 
                  Japan for the N64. Treasure most recently developed the 
                  Nintendo-published GameCube game <I>Wario World</I>.</p>

Michel Ancel is head of one of Ubisoft's most respected game studios having developed titles such as Rayman, Beyond Good & Evil, and King Kong.  Other popular Ubisoft series include Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell.  "We were among the first publishers to see the control design in action," said Serge Hascoet, Chief Creative Officer of Ubisoft in response to the unveiling of the Revolution controller. "We're excited about the new controller and are looking forward to taking advantage of its innovative aspects." </p>

                  <P>Nintendo confirmed its partnership with UK development 
                  studio, Zoonami, to make a GameCube project. The title, with 
                  science-fiction elements, was tentatively dubbed <I>Game 
                  Zero</I>. Few details were revealed and nothing has been heard 
                  of the game since. Zoonami's president, Martin Hollis, former 
                  head of software at Rare, has led projects such as Perfect 
                  Dark and Goldeneye 007. Is it possible <I>Game Zero</I> will 
                  make an appearance on the Revolution? Anything is possible, 
                  but don't hold your breath.</P>
