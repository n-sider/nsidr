                  <P>Nintendo "Revolution" is the term Nintendo has come to 
                  describe its next-generation home console - or more 
                  appropriately, its post-GameCube creation. The name alone, 
                  shrouded in secrecy, conjures up all sorts of crazy and 
                  innovative ideas. <B>"Revolution"</B> brings us images of 
                  rebellion, anarchy and most importantly <I>change</I>. That is 
                  the overwhelming effect Nintendo is striving to incite upon 
                  us.</P>
                  <P>With its aptly chosen codename, Nintendo has already made 
                  the gaming community aware of its intention to shake things up 
                  a bit during this coming generation. It's going to be an 
                  interesting journey -- and N-Sider will do its best to keep 
                  you up to date on the latest revelations of the impending 
                  revolution.</P>

                  <P><B>Q: What is the Nintendo Revolution?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: "Revolution" is the title given to 
                    Nintendo's preliminary next-generation home console. It is 
                    not the final name but rather its codename. Revolution is 
                    used to describe the console both internally and within the 
                    media until a final name has been decided 
                  upon.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Nintendo officially states that preliminary 
                    development on Revolution began immediately before the 
                    introduction of the Nintendo GameCube (Note: September 14, 
                    2001 in Japan and November 18, 2001 in North America).</P>

                    <P></P>
                    <P>In May of 2003, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the 
                    company was willing to invest a significant amount of its 
                    nearly $6 billion cash reserves into the development of both 
                    the next-generation console and portable hardware. He said 
                    he plans to make the next consoles "...the greatest gaming 
                    machines ever." He also spoke about characters and 
                    franchises and stated that he plans to introduce new 
                    franchises and is hoping they will reach the success of 
                    <I>Mario</I> and <I>Pokmon</I>. At the time, he stated 
                    there is heavy development towards these new 
                    franchises.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

The new console boasts high-quality materials and a smart, compact design, approximately the size of three standard DVD cases stacked together. It's almost portable... A variety of prototype colors were showcased during E3 (final colors are to be determined) and the system will come with a silver stand so that it can sit vertically. In addition, the console is said to be exceptionally quiet and consume little power.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
                  <P><B>Q: When was the Nintendo Revolution codename 
                  announced?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: On May 11, 2004 at Nintendo's 2004 
                    pre-Electronics Entertainment Expo press conference, which 
                    took place in Los Angeles, California.</P>
                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Prior to the 2004 E3 Expo, 
                    several gaming websites and magazines referred to the 
                    codename of the console as "GCNext" (GameCube Next) and "N5" 
                    (Nintendo's 5th home console). Since then, there have been 
                    several unsubstantiated rumors regarding the console's final 
                    name -- "Nintendo 21" being the most recent. At the Tokyo Game Show on September 16, 2005, the Revolution console lacked the prior Revolution logo (<a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-25-revolution_logo.jpg">Logo One</a>, <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news_05-17-2005_revolution052.jpeg">Logo Two</a>).  It's suspected that by excluding it, Nintendo is preparing the final name and logo for the unit.

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: While speaking to the audience at its E3 
                    press conference on May 11, 2004, directly after introducing 
                    the Nintendo DS, Nintendo president <A

                    approach to our next home system. It won't simply be new or 
                    include new technologies. Better technology is good, but not 
                    enough. Today's consoles already offer fairly realistic 
                    expressions so simply beefing up the graphics will not let 
                    most of us see a difference. So what should a new machine 
                    do? Much more. An unprecedented gameplay experience. 
                    Something no other machine has delivered before.</P>
                    <P>The definition for a new machine must be different. I 
                    want you to know that Nintendo is working on our next system 
                    and that system will create a gaming revolution. Internal 
                    development is underway.</P>
                    <P>I could give you our technical specs, as I'd know you'd

                    difference is over.</P>
                    <P>Work on Revolution is well underway. When you see it you 
                    will be excited because you will experience a gaming

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact:</B> Yes, according to Nintendo. However, again 
                    the company adds that in addition to increased graphical eye

                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Nintendo is not yet ready to divulge that 
                    info as it indicated at the 2004 E3 Expo.

<p>In March 2005, IBM and ATI confirmed that they have been making the CPU codenamed "Broadway" and GPU codenamed "Hollywood" for Revolution respectively. In April 2005, MoSys, who supplied RAM for GameCube, said it would also provide the memory solution for Revolution.</p>

<p>A month later at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, Nintendo revealed that Revolution will be less than three DVD cases thick.  The unit will also be fully backward-compatible with the Nintendo GameCube allowing it to use the same controllers, memory cards and play both GameCube optical discs and proprietary 12cm Revolution discs.  All discs will be inserted using a slot-loading drive on the face of the unit.  The console will also go online via Wi-Fi connections (it was announced that Nintendo would partner with Broadcom to develop wireless networking for the console), be able to download software from the Internet, and be SD Card compatible and use 512MB flash memory to save data.  Finally, the Revolution will utilize wireless controllers and feature two USB 2.0 ports.</p>

<P>Nintendo president Satoru Iwata explained Nintendo's technological philosophy in an interview with the Seattle Post Intelligence.</p>

<p><i>"Sony and Microsoft are taking about the same approach for the future by making machines with powerful and sophisticated technology. Nintendo is taking a little bit different approach, and I think this is an interesting contrast.  Of course, we are applying advances in technology. But when you use those advances just to boost the processing power, the trade-off is that you increase power consumption, make the machine more expensive and make developing games more expensive. When I look at the balance of that trade-off -- what you gain and what you lose -- I don't think it's good. Nintendo is applying the benefits of advanced technology, but we're using it to make our machines more power-efficient, quieter and faster to start. And we're making a brand-new user interface. I think that way of thinking is the biggest difference."</i> -<FONT size=1> Satoru Iwata, Nintendo President</font>

<p>Furthermore, Nintendo wishes to create a console that is easy to develop for.  Nintendo revealed that a new development architecture will accommodate both big-budget "masterpieces" as well as artistic, indie offerings designed to make sure that everyone from video game experts to newcomers find ways to share and enjoy the gaming experience. Nintendo says that development will not require a steep new learning curve. In this way, just like Nintendo DS, its a place where the best ideas "not the biggest budgets" will win.</p>
                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: It is likely Nintendo will 
                    hold its cards close to its chest, waiting for Microsoft and 
                    Sony to make the first move. As we reported earlier in the 
                    year in our <A

                    Next-Gen Specs</A> article, rumors indicated that Nintendo was 
                    working on two separate systems for Revolution and that 
                    ultimately one would be chosen for retail.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Yes, according to Nintendo Senior Managing

                    Takeda</A>, the Revolution will be able to interface with 
                    both a television and a computer monitor. In June 2004 
                    Takeda said, "You'll be able to play [Revolution] not just 
                    by linking up to a television but to a computer monitor as 
                    well."</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

                 <P><B>Q: Will the console support high-definition?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: No, it will not support output in the accepted 720p, 1080i or 1080p high-definition formats. It will however support 480p (progressive-scan) and be compatible with component outputs.</p> 
<p>Perrin Kaplan told IGN.com, <i>"Nintendo's Revolution is being built with a variety of gamers' needs in mind, such as quick start-up time, high power, and ease of use for development and play. It's also compact and sleek, and has beautiful graphics in which to enjoy innovative games.  Nintendo doesn't plan for the system to be HD compatible as with that comes a higher price for both the consumer and also the developer creating the game. Will it make the game better to play? With the technology being built into the Revolution, we believe the games will look brilliant and play brilliantly. This can all be done without HD."</i></p></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

                    is very likely, especially given Nintendo's stance on 
                    connectivity in the past. Also, the recent comments by 
                    Nintendo itself indicate this direction will continue.

                 <P><B>Q: Who are Nintendo's hardware partners on 
                  Revolution?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: In December 2002 Bloomberg reported that 
                    Nintendo had agreed to collaborate with NEC on a system LSI 
                    that would serve as the core for the new console. 
                    Furthermore, in early February it was announced that 
                    Japanese chipmaker Elpida was negotiating with Nintendo to 
                    produce DRAM chips for use in the Revolution console. Most 
                    recently, in March 2005 at the Game Developers Conference, 
                    Satoru Iwata announced that IBM is providing the Revolution 
                    CPU codenamed "Broadway" while ATI is creating the GPU 
                    codenamed "Hollywood". The CPU is apparently called 
                    "Broadway" because Broadway, New York, is the capital of 
                    musical entertainment. The GPU is named as such because 
                    Hollywood, California is the capital of movie entertainment. 
                    President Satoru Iwata explains, "With Revolution, we are 
                    determined to create the new capital of interactive [video 
                    game] entertainment."</I> Perhaps coincidentally, IBM's 
                    headquarters are located in New York and ATI has a 
                    development facility in California.</P>

                    interact with new and visually compelling digital worlds.

                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Yes, as confirmed by Satoru Iwata at the 
                    2005 Game Developers Conference. The console will include 
                    built-in Wi-Fi features and utilize the "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection" service upon its release.</P>
                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Given the current trend of 
                    consoles, it's been highly likely Nintendo would go online 
                    via one route or another. Nintendo's history of online 
                    ventures shows that the company is interested in the idea.

                    <P>It's also very likely Nintendo will make an attempt at 
                    creating an entirely new way of connecting people. 
                    Nintendo's revolution may very well be in how it handles the 
                    gaming community -- in how it allows players to play across 
                    long distances <B>without</B> resorting to an online 
                    approach (fees, broadband, etc.). Recent rumors indicate 
                    that the Revolution may function as a hub to wirelessly 
                    network other consoles.</P>

                    more in the area of community, and we are looking at how to

                    flawed. We think the consumer wants a better way. And that's 
                    what we're looking to do with Revolution. What I am saying 
                    is that with our next home console we will address the area 
                    of gamer community. You said "online." I used "online" as a 
                    description of a flawed business model. We are passionate

                    <P>Mr. Fils-Aime has gone on further to say that there are 
                    things that have been published in technical journals that 
                    talk about how to deliver a sense of community that is 
                    different than an Internet-based online experience. "We will 
                    share much more come E3 [2005]", he 
                  said.</P>

<p>And so it was confirmed at E3 that communication will be enhanced by the free "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection" service. Nintendo revealed it is creating an environment where people can choose who they want to play with. In addition to providing gamers with the choice of playing with random strangers, parents worried about their children's ears being filled with explicatives every five minutes can utlize a special buddy list and choose to have them play games from Animal Crossing to Super Smash Bros. with friends, rather than being forced to endure the testosterone-filled services offered by competitors.  More details regarding the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection are expected to be revealed later this year upon the launch of the service for the company's portable Nintendo DS.</p>

                  <P><B>Q: What type of media will the Revolution use for its 
                  games?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-06-14-revolution.jpg" align="right" border"0"><B>Fact</B>:  Revolution will support two disc formats. Instead of a tray, a single, innovative, self-loading media bay will play both 12-centimeter optical discs used for the new system as well as Nintendo GameCube discs. The 12-centimeter discs, which are the same size of a DVD, can be dual layered to offer up to 8GB of data storage.  Furthermore, owners will have the option of equipping a small, self-contained attachment to play movies and other DVD content.</p>
 
                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Nintendo will likely go for a 
                    proprietary format. Nintendo has always been very guarded 
                    about piracy and there's no indications that this will 
                    change.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>:  Yes and no.  Nintendo said it will offer owners the <i>option</i> of purchasing and equipping a small, self-contained attachment to play movies and other DVD content.  There is currently no word on the ability to record video media.  Nintendo has always been a gaming company at heart and the inclusion of any other media -- although it is including DVD playback -- is not something the company will place significant focus on.</p>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Yes, as confirmed by president Satoru Iwata 
                    at the 2005 Game Developers Conference.  The Revolution will be backwards-compatibile with GameCube software as well as peripherals including the Wave Bird controller, memory cards, Mario Party microphone, Dance Dance dance pad, and Donkey Konga konga controller.  But there's more to it. The console will also have downloadable access to 20 years of fan-favorite titles originally released for Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo Entertainment System.</P>
                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Nintendo is known for its 
                    backwards-compatibility with its portable systems. Although 
                    Nintendo has dabbled with the idea with its home consoles, 
                    it is not something that until now, has ever become reality.

                  <P><B>Q: What is this I hear about being able to download classic Nintendo titles?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: The console will have downloadable access to select titles originally released for Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo calls this "virtual gaming". The company plans to utilize pay downloads as the standard for this system however there is the possibility for many types of services including free limited-time downloads or bonus downloads for the purchase of new games.  It has been confirmed that other companies will also be able to offer their old software for download.</p>

<p><i>"At this point, we've only been talking with a few companies. However, if other companies come forward and they want to join us to work with us to create games, of course that would be great for us. One thing we want to make sure that we don't do is have too many games of the same type or genre. We don't want too many games involving the same themes or characters."</i> - <font size="1">Shigeru Miyamoto</font></p>

<p>Recently Nintendo commented that it may improve the graphics in some of its classic titles.  "We are doing several experiments, including working with the original Super Mario Bros., with the new technology," Iwata told EGM in an interview. "The game itself and the gameplay shall be identical, but the look will be different -- it's possible that with Revolution we may be able to see the old games with new looks."</p>

                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: If you've followed Nintendo's history, you may recall Nintendo experimenting with a similar idea on the Nintendo 64.  The 64 disk drive peripheral would have offered users a similar service.  In particular, Randnet and Nintendo created an emulator that would allow NES games to be downloaded for as low as $1.  This was partially in response to Sega and NEC's announcement of downloadable Genesis games for Dreamcast.</p>

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Downloads will be stored in flash memory. Players will be able to store game and game data in 512 megabytes of flash memory. If this space is filled, users can transfer downloads to an SD memory card or use a PC to manage files. The company chose flash memory over a hard disk because it is more durable, reliable and cheaper. The flash memory could also potentially be used to save game data, update the Revolution firmware, and download Revolution demos.  Furthmore, N-Sider has learned that the GameSpy network will offer server side storage options for things such as personal content, scores, and even levels.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Preliminary kits, according to our sources.  When asked about whether kits had gone out at E3 2005, however, Shigeru Miyamoto said no, "We have not sent out development kits to developers yet.  However, development kits for the Nintendo Revolution are very similar to the ones for the GameCube. So we feel that the environments are so similar that they will be able to start development very quickly upon receiving the development kits for Revolution."</P>

                  <P><B>Q: Will the Revolution use a standard game console

                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: For the longest time, this was Nintendo's response:

<p><i>"Controllers for current consoles have more than doubled [in complexity] from older console. They may satisfy the hardcore gamers, but they've become too difficult for more casual gamers.  For the next-generation console, we plan to introduce a friendly user interface so that, for example, a mother who's watching her child playing a game might say, 'Oh, I'd like to try that too.' However, user interfaces are devices that can be easily imitated by other companies, so I can't reveal any details right now."</i><br> - <font size="1">Satoru Iwata</font></p>

<p>On September 15, at the Tokyo Game Show in Japan, the Revolution controller was finally unveiled in a keynote speech from Nintendo president Satoru Iwata.  You can watch the keynote in its entirety <a href="http://www.irwebcasting.com/050916/03/index.html">here</a>. 1Up.com had the opportunity to see the controller first hand and they described it as such: <i>"The controller for Nintendo's upcoming Revolution home console system is a cordless remote-control-like device designed to be used with only one hand. Two small sensors placed near the TV and a chip inside the controller track its position and orientation, allowing the player to manipulate the action on screen by physically moving the controller itself. For example, you could slash an in-game sword by actually swinging the controller from side to side, turn a race car just by twisting your wrist, or aim your gun in a shooter by pointing the controller where you want to fire.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-30-revcontrol3.jpg"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-30-revcontrol3thumb.jpg" border="0"></a></p>

<p>An expansion port on the bottom of the unit allows for add-on hardware to compliment this "remote controller" (our word for it, not Nintendo's), like a second controller piece Nintendo demonstrated that comes equipped with an analog stick and two trigger buttons (currently labeled Z1 and Z2, for those of you keeping track). When the two controller pieces are attached, the so-called 'Nunchaku' configuration (the two bits are connected by a short cord) can work similarly to current controllers, just with the second analog stick replaced by actual movement of the Revolution controller. Nintendo also mentioned that the controller stick could be slipped inside other, more conventional controller shells, dance mats, bongos, or other peripherals.</p>

<p>A large "A" button sits in the prime spot under your thumb on the face of the controller, with a "B" trigger on the back of the unit for your index finger. Otherwise the button configuration is an interesting mix of old and new: standard D-pad up top, near the power button (to turn the Revolution console on and off), Start and Select in the middle, on either side of the intriguing "Home" button (Nintendo wouldn't go into detail, but sounds like it has to do with navigating system menus, which will be important given the Revolution's promised WiFi connectivity), and two more buttons near the bottom labeled "a" and "b." These last two may seem uncomfortably low for your thumb until you turn the controller 90 degrees and it becomes just like an old 8-bit NES joypad, with the D-pad under your left thumb and "a" and "b" under your right. (Don't forget-Nintendo has promised downloadable versions of their classic games for the Revolution's "Virtual Console.") Nintendo mentioned the button names and their exact sizes could still change slightly before production, but what you see here is close to the final design.</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the controller, the four lights at the very bottom represent which player it belongs to, and that hatch on the back is the battery compartment. (The prototype Revolution controllers we saw used regular batteries just like the GameCube's WaveBird wireless controller-and last a similar amount of time, according to Nintendo-but reps wouldn't say for certain if the final unit would use batteries or some rechargeable option.) The effective maximum range for the wireless controller is expected to be somewhere between 10 and 15 feet. A variety of different colored controllers were on display, including red, lime green, white, gray, black, and silver. Finally, rumble functionality is built in to the controller."</i></p>

<p>There were several demonstrations on hand including a fishing simulation, a demonstration of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and air hockey.  Check out this <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/651/651334p1.html">video</a> for several potential uses of the controller.</p>

<P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-30-revcontrol1.jpg"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-30-revcontrol1thumb.jpg" border="0" align="right"></a>Since the Revolution controller enables the idea of expansion through the use of accessories, there is still much left to speculate on.  What sort of accessories will Nintendo release to take advantage of the controller?  Will there be a wheel, will there be a <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-25-revolution_lightgun.jpg">light gun</a>, or will there be a modified <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-25-revolution_gccontrol.jpg">GameCube controller</a>?  Also, what peripherals will or won't be packaged with the console upon release?  We've yet to get concrete answers to these questions.  All we know with certainty is that peripherals are in development.</p>  

<p><i>"The new interface will allow some new forms of innovation.  Already, you're seeing changes in Nintendo DS, which has a microphone, input pen, and touch screen. We have a number of candidates for a new [Revolution] interface but are not ready to reveal them. All I can say right now is that whatever we choose will be intuitive and easy to use for everyone."</i> - <font size="1">Satoru Iwata</font></p>

                    <P>Nintendo has said how the Nintendo DS is a good 
                    indication of the approach that's being taken with 
                    Revolution. Although that and this next statement are not 
                    contextually related, a relation is still possible. <I>"The 
                    d-pad is also on the DS, but I was worried about its removal 
                    many times during development since it's used by lots of 
                    previous games,"</I> noted Shigeru Miyamoto. 
                    <I>"Surprisingly, I didnt know at the time that the DS 
                    would also play GBA games."</I></P>

                    <P>Beyond the DS's slight connection to the past (GBA 
                    compatibility), it's been said over and again that the main 
                    motivation for creating the Nintendo DS was a yearning to 
                    manifest games that are completely new and interesting. This 
                    is no doubt the same motivation driving the creative forces 
                    of the Revolution hardware.</P>

"But the fact of the matter is, to realize voice commands all you have to do is install a microphone," Iwata explained in an interview.  "We realize a few of our competitors are already thinking of following us on this, so it will not be a defining feature of the new console.  We may or may not use the microphone in the new [Nintendo Revolution] interface."  Nintendo offers other hints on the direction of the controller.</p> 

<p><i>"...if you just think about it, we're going to have the ability through wireless internet to download all of your great games from NES, SNES, N64. Think about it: Each of those controllers were different. How are you gonna play? That captured some the imagination of what our controller needs to be able to do, and certainly as you get into the meat of that type of innovation with the developers, their eyes truly light up because they start to imagine what's possible with that type of configuration, which is vastly different than a sheer horsepower type of game.</i> - <font size="1">Reggie Fils-Aime, interview with EGM</font></p>

<p>With the 'Home' button prominently displayed on the controller, many have come to suspect the network will be a vital piece to the Revolution console and that its interface will be just as intuitive and unique as the rest of the console.</p>

                    system will, according to Nintendo, fundamentally change how 
                    games are played. The change will moreover not just be in 
                    the visuals, but in the gameplay itself.</P>

                    <P>Nintendo says it feels the Revolution will be a "paradigm 
                    shift" in gaming -- of which it hopes will bring back older 
                    gamers who don't play games anymore and also introduce 
                    non-gamers to gaming. Nintendo stresses the most "strong 
                    community" and "immersive games".  Nintendo likes to call this "All-Access Gaming".  For more on this 'revolution', read N-Sider's article <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/all-access-gaming">here</a>.</P>

                    <P>In fact, Nintendo has been making a gradual change this

                    developers said that Nintendo had approached them about 
                    developing for the GameCube successor and that the company 
                    was aiming for a Spring 2005 release. Since then it has been revealed the company will wait until 
                    2006 in order to extend the life of this current generation. 
                    Sony also agrees with this line of

                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Nintendo may choose to price 
                    the console the same as competitors or instead choose to

                  <P><B>Q: Does Nintendo have the experience to tackle the 
                  next-generation?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Sit down son; Nintendo is the most 
                    experienced video game console manufacturer alive today and 
                    perhaps ever. The Revolution will be Nintendo's 5th home 
                    console - starting with the Nintendo Entertainment 
                    System/Famicom, moving to the Super Nintendo Entertainment 
                    System/Super Famicom, and then the Nintendo 64, and 
                    ultimately reaching the present with Nintendo GameCube. This 
                    is compared to Sony who will be going into its third home 
                    console cycle and Microsoft who will only be introducing its 
                    second. Moreover, with the Nintendo DS, Nintendo will have 
                    also experienced five portable variations of its Game Boy 
                    line. Put simply, there is no company that has Nintendo's 
                    over two decades of experience. And that, young grasshopper, 
                    is that. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
                  <P><B>Q: When will Nintendo reveal more about 
                  Revolution?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: Although Nintendo's full "coming out" party wasn't at the recent 2005 E3 Expo as many expected nor was it at the September Tokyo Game Show, Nintendo has gone on record saying it will reveal the full array of information regarding the console by year's end.  If not by then, there's always E3 2006...</P>


                    <P></P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
                  <P><B>Q: Can we look forward to playing great video games on Revolution?</B></P>
                  <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
                    <P><B>Fact</B>: At the end of the day, Nintendo is most confident in the fact that the software will define the success of the console.  "...software sells hardware," Iwata explains.  "People buy hardware to play the games they love. I agree with Steve Jobs, the head of Apple, when he says, "Software is the user experience." Software is the driving technology not just of computers, but of all consumer electronics..."</p>

                    <P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: We're confident in Nintendo's software position.  Not only will it be creating a console market that supports next-generation video games and next-generation control, it will also be home to retro games and retro gamepad control.  High-budget or low-budget.  Big or small.  No other console will feature such variety and no other console will provide developers with the flexible canvas necessary to turn even the craziest idea into a game.
