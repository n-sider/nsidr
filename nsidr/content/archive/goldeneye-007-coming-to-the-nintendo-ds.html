<p>A title based on Goldeneye 007 will be coming exclusively to the Nintendo DS courtesy of Electronic Arts, according to GCAdvanced.com.  Very little is known, however it's said that the title will feature multiplayer between 8 to 16 players at a time.  Wait for an official announcement from EA and Nintendo.</p>
