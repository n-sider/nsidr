The first information for <i>Metroid Prime 3</i> since the cryptic E3 teaser trailer has arrived.  A recent interview with Retro Studios was posted at <a href="http://www.luminothtemple.com">Luminoth Temple</a>, a Nintendo-operated Metroid-centric message board.  You can read the full interview (graciously posted on our forum by poster N-Zero) <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showpost.php?p=63105&postcount=2978">here</a>.
<br><br>
But for those of you that just want the facts, here's the key information from the interview:

<ul>
<li><i>Metroid Prime 3</i> is the conclusion of the <i>Metroid Prime Trilogy</i>.  In theory the inevitable next Metroid won't include 'Prime' in the title.</i>
<li>Retro will be utilizing the new innovations of the Revolution system and controller for the game.</i>
<li>The game will be in first person and include different visors for Samus to use just as in the previous titles.</i>
<li>Phazon will play a major role.</i>
<li>Kenji Yamamoto will be working on the music for the game.</i>
<li>Andrew Jones has returned to develop concept art.</i>
  </ul>
