"If you're a fan of the One Piece franchise, Grand Adventure is simply a no-brainer. The amount of depth and entertainment found in this seemingly tame fighter is just amazing, and even if you've already gotten your fill from One Piece: Grand Battle, there's still enough extra content to make this one worth your cash. Players be warned ahead of time though, that most of the gameplay is still the same. While the addition of bigger super attacks and a huge roster of support characters should be enough for the die-hard, it may be a bit shallow for others who were expecting Grand Adventure to be a full-on redesign of the franchise. At the core of its design, Grand Adventure is simply the next installment to an already solid gameplay mechanic, though it offers a tremendous amount of game for those willing to dive in. It is truly a One Piece fan's dream come true."

"It's a great looking game, almost rivaling the animation of the cartoon series. Expect to see almost all of the characters from the show as well as some new ones. As for music, there are almost 80 tracks of tunes. That's a big soundtrack. Could have used more voiceovers. The menus are easy to navigate and the entire game has a clean, colorful, artistic look to it that is very pleasing to the eye. There are 25 different fighters, each with different move sets and unique special attacks. The variety of modes, the insane amount of unlockables and the sheer element of fun makes Grand Adventure a game not to be missed."

<b>Nintendo Power says</b> (5.5/10),<br>
"Eight minigames, hundreds of pieces of collectibel card art, and unlockable character models and music add to a feature-laden game.  Deep as it may be, though, the game is 95% fighting.  If you aren't expecting a genuinely grand adventure, you'll have a good time."
