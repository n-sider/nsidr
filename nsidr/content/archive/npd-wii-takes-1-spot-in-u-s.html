<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3750-1.gif" width="165" height="102" class="image_styled" /></div>In what must come as a pleasant PR opportunity considering the beating Nintendo's been taking in the enthusiast press over their decidedly casual-centric (and, in the case of <i>Wii Music</i>, just plain WTF-ish) showing at E3 this week, Nintendo announced yesterday that by sales tracking outfit NPD's reckoning, Wii has taken first place among consoles in the U.S., beating out Microsoft's Xbox 360 and its one-year lead.<br />
<br />
Wii sales for June totalled a rather ominous-sounding 666,000 units sold, bringing LTD totals to nearly 10.9 million in the 20 months since the system's launch.  Nintendo DS put in a good showing as well, moving over 783,000 units.<br />
<br />
Six of the top 10 best-sellers for June are Nintendo-platform games as well.  DS's <i>Guitar Hero On Tour</i> took the #2 spot, <i>Wii Fit</i> #4, <i>Wii Play</i> #5, <i>Mario Kart Wii</i> #6, <i>LEGO Indiana Jones</i> for Wii #7, and <i>LEGO Indiana Jones</i> for DS #9.
