It's that time of the week again, and Nintendo of America has loaded the Wii Shop Channel with three new Virtual Console games.<br />
<br />
Leading off is perennial fan-favorite <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> for 1,000 Wii points.  Of course, fans will also note that they've had a few opportunities to own this title already on the Nintendo GameCube, via the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=159"><i>Wind Waker</i></a> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=158">preorder bonus</a> with <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time: Master Quest</i> as well as the original, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=485"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition</i></a>, so thankfully, those not keen on buying the game again have alternatives as well.  The complete release list:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> (Nintendo 64, 1,000 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Bio-Hazard Battle</i> (Sega Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Chew Man Fu</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
To snag any one of these titles, head over to your Wii Shop Channel and buy, buy, buy!
