The warnings, accompanied by related images, total nine pages.  Needless to say, they're quite humorous, especially when a non-Japanese speaker tries to put their own twist on what the warnings say.  Check out the strange look into what Nintendo recommends <i>not</i> doing to your Nintendo DS <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/archives/001089.php">here</a>.  No Nintendo DS barbecues please.
