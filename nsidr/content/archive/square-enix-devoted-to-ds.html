Square-Enix's chief executive Yoichi Wada commented on the state of the video game industry in an <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0386865c-179e-11dc-86d1-000b5df10621.html">interview</a> with the <i>Financial Times</i>, where he made the claim that handhelds drive the market and have the most diverse audience.<br />
<br />
In the past, Wada explained, it was entirely feasible to make a profit developing for the Playstation and Game Boy, but that is no longer a feasible route, as other platforms have risen to new levels of popularity. In fact, <i>Dragon Quest IX</i> is being exclusively developed for the DS for one reason only, says Wada. The DS has the largest market, including many people new to gaming. Square-Enix is a company looking for profit, and they believe developing for the DS is the best choice for achieving that goal.<br />
<br />
Square-Enix intends to develop software for all kinds of people, including those new to gaming. No examples were given, but Square-Enix did announce their own batch of "non-games" not so long ago, including <i>DS Yoga Lessons You Can Start Today</i>, <i>Flower-Blooming DS Gardening Lite</i>, and <i>Why Not Listen to Classical Music On DS?</i> (developed by iNiS, more commonly known as the home of <i>Elite Beat Agents</i>), as well as a line of travel guide software based on the Japanese travel guide World Walking.<br />
<br />
Wada also commented that "certain next-generation consoles" are too powerful for their time and too demanding of the user with the need for a high-definition TV, broadband internet, and gaming knowledge. In a year or two Wada believes they will be doing better, but for now, developing exclusively for a console like the PS3 is risky business.<br />
<br />
Wada made no specific comments about development for the Wii, but it does notably lack some of the aspects he believes are holding back the other consoles, namely HD and a requirement to be a hardcore gamer. Wii has also seen much more support from Square-Enix than the GameCube, even this early in its lifespan. For now, though, expect to see more offerings from Square-Enix on the DS.
