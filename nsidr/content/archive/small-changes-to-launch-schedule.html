<p>Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> said during a shareholders meeting on Wednesday that there might be small changes in the Revolution launch schedule.  He said, "There is no possibility that the Revolution's launch will fall behind by too much, but there might be some small changes [in its release schedule]." Meanwhile, according to GameSpot, Iwata told shareholders that Nintendo is prepared for the next-generation console war with a "long-term plan on what kinds of titles will be released at what stage" for the Revolution. Nintendo has already announced the development of several titles including games based on the Super Mario, Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Bros., Metroid, and Donkey Kong franchises.
