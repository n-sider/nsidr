<p>Electronic Arts made an announcement today regarding its exclusive licensing agreement with the National Football League and Players Inc. to develop, publish, and distribute interactive football games on home consoles for the next five years. This means EA now has the exclusive rights to the NFL teams, stadiums, and players for use in its football video games for the next half decade.</p> 

<p>NFL titles such as ESPN NFL, NFL GameDay, and NFL Blitz will no longer be released under a National Football League relation. Midway for example, has decided to continue developing football games under the title <i>Blitz: Playmakers</i>.  It is unknown if other publishers will follow suit.</p>

<p>In related news, Electronic Arts has partnered with Nintendo to license Nintendo content for use in its latest GameCube basketball title <i>NBA Street V3</i>.  The specifics of the extra content has not yet been announced, however the boxart can be seen below, courtesy of EBGames.com.</p>
