<p>Although the loser of the next-generation is still under debate, the winner has been unanimously decided as the Nintendo Wii.</p>

<p>You may recall last <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2133">Thursday</a> Peter Moore, vice president of Microsoft's Games Division, told Reuters that he predicts consumers will choose two consoles: Nintendo's Wii and Microsoft's Xbox 360. "Tell me why you would buy a $600 PS3?" he asked. "People are going to buy two (machines.) They're going to buy an Xbox and they're going to buy a Wii...for the price of one PS3."</p>

<p>Phil Harrison, executive vice president of Sony Computer Entertainment, has responded to Moore's statement in partial agreement.  "I think Peter Moore is exactly right," he told <a href="http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=55089">GamePro</a> in an interview.  "I think Nintendo will be the second system consumers purchase after PlayStation 3.  I haven't had a chance to check out the Wii myself, but Nintendo has a great history of innovation and has always done great things for gaming and long may they do so. But as it relates to our strategy they are very much in a different market."</p>

<p>Meanwhile on message-boards there have been factions of hardcore gamers forming. On one side are those in the PSWii camp.  On the other side are those attached to the Wii60.  If there is one thing that can be gained from this movement, it's the Nintendo Wii will be the hardcore gamer's console of choice with a PS3 or 360 as a secondary diversion.</p>
