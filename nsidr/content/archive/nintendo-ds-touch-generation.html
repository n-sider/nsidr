<p>Nintendo has been promoting the "touch" aspect of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> in Japan with great success.  It has been using the "Touch Generation" moniker to introduce games such as Brain Training, which appeal to people who generally don't play games. It was learned today that Nintendo of America will begin using the Touch Generation branding in the United States with the release of Sudoku Gridmaster.  Future titles that fall into this category will adorn a small "G" logo on their boxart.  Sudoku Gridmaster is scheduled for a June 26 release.</p>

<p>In related news, a new fansite called <a href="http://www.touchmyds.com/">TouchMyDS</a> has appeared on the 'net.  It includes a plethora of images taken with the Nintendo DS in various poses and touched by everything from piggies to dragons.  Users can submit their own 'touching' DS pictures.  Otherwise, simply click on each image that appears to view the next eye-opening scene.</p>
