Working Designs announced yesterday that it has closed its office doors.  The company was known for localizing some of the most memorable RPGs during the PlayStation generation including <i>Alundra</i> and <i>Lunar</i>.  The announcement was made by Vic Ireland, the company's president, in the WorkingDesigns.com <a href="http://www.workingdesigns.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118916">forums</a>.  Best of luck to their employees in finding future employment.  And here's to hoping that another publisher will pick up where Working Designs left off and continue to bring niche Japanese gems to North America.
