<i>Mario Kart Wii</i> has started showing up in Europe, and with it some great news for online players: you can use WiiConnect24 to send invitations to play to people in your Wii Address Book, building up the game's Friend Roster without requiring you to manually exchange Friend Codes.<br />
<br />
This new feature (which sounds similar to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/open-all-nightaeur-but-to-what-end/3">an idea I proposed</a> last December) finally brings together the disparate Wi-Fi Connection and WiiConnect24 networks, which could prove to be a big deal in upcoming titles like <i>Animal Crossing Wii</i>.  Credit for the long-in-coming marriage likely lies with Kart vet Hideki Konno, who Nintendo Co. president Satoru Iwata <a href="http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/mariokart/vol1_page2.jsp">called</a> "one of our foremost online gamers within the company".<br />
