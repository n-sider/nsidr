In an interview with CVG, <i>No More Heroes</i> director Gouichi Suda, previously known in Nintendo circles for GameCube title <i>Killer7</i>, bemoaned the lack of third-party success on Wii&#8212;blaming a non-gamer focus.<br />

<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Gouichi Suda</span>Whilst the sales weren't as high as I hoped, other titles for Wii aren't selling so well either. Only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't just because of the current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan...<br />
<br />
Actually I was very surprised about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different to what I expected.</div></div><br />
