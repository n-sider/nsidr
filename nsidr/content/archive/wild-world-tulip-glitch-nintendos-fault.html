<p>Nintendo has finally <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/consumerservice/showTopic.do?topicId=GTS_ACWW&catId=Game_Specific#GTS_ACWW_redtulip">issued official information</a> regarding the now-infamous "tulip glitch" that affected <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a> players.</p>

<p>The glitch found players logging in to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with their <i>Wild World</i> games recieving a rather mysterious letter containing random characters.  Attached to the letter was an item that would take the form of a red tulip if planted &mdash; unlike regular tulips, it could be planted in the stone tile outside buildings &mdash; or if placed in the home, an invisible, immovable piece of furniture that could not be picked up again.</p>

<p>Nintendo's official word on the matter is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>I received a mysterious letter in Animal Crossing: Wild World which contains a "Red Tulip." What is this?</b><br>
If you received this letter as a result of logging into the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection network on January 26, it was the result of a temporary internal error with the communication tool used to upload the letters onto the network.</p>

<p><b>How does the "Red Tulip" interfere with game play?</b><br>
If sold or planted outside, nothing out of the ordinary is known to occur at this time; however, if placed on the floor of your living room, the Red Tulip will render the spot where it's placed useless. As a result, other items cannot be placed on or moved across it.</p>

<p><b>Was this the result of someone hacking into Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection?</b><br>
No. This was the result of a temporary internal error with the tool used to upload the letters onto the network.</p>

<p><b>What do I do if I have received this letter?</b><br>
If you received the letter, please delete it. If you have the item in your inventory, please place it in the recycle bin for disposal.</p>

<p><b>If I already placed the "Red Tulip" in my home, how do I get rid of it?</b><br>
At this time, we have not determined how to remove the item from a player's home. We're continuing to look into this issue and will be sure to update this FAQ if a solution is found. Nintendo sincerely apologizes for this inconvenience and we're working to ensure this doesn't happen again.</p></blockquote>
