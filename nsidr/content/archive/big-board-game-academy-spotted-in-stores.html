Nintendo Gal spotted an interesting find while out shopping: a University Games-created <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/1865-Shopping-Saturday-Big-Brain-Board-Game.html">board game</a> based on <i>Big Brain Academy</i>. <br />

She describes it thusly:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">As with the video game, the goal here is to have the bigger, heavier brain than your opponents by collecting the tokens you receive from each category. Whichever side weighs more according to the included scale when the pieces are dumped in, wins. To start, a player spins the spinner to determine the category they'll be playing in. The way to gather the tokens is to draw a card and answer/solve the questions on them and repeat this as fast as possible in the span of 30 seconds per turn.</div><br />
The board game retails for about $20, and was found at a Target store.  Your mileage may vary in finding this game for yourself.
