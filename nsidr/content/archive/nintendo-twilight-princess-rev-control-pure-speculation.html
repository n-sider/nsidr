<p>Eurogamer has <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=62348">received official dismissal</a> from Nintendo of the story in NGC magazine which claimed the delayed-from-2005 GameCube title <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911"><i>Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i></a> was, in fact, delayed because Nintendo was adding Revolution control to the title as a bonus for folks playing it on their Revolution consoles.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, the NGC article, which was pretty light on details to begin with  offering only the "news" that the title would have alternative Revolution control schemes, then padded to several pages with E3 2005 secreenshots and their own speculation  is "pure speculation".  The full statement follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>The article in the January edition of NGC Magazine is pure speculation.</p>

<p>Nintendo have made no new announcements regarding The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. We can however confirm that the game is still in development and that it will launch on Nintendo GameCube in 2006.</p></blockquote>
