<p>Nintendo has released their latest financial results, and they show a 21% drop in profits over the first half of 2004.</p>

<p>For reasoning, Nintendo fingered R&D costs for their next console, code-named Revolution, which is due to launch in 2006. Falling sales of GameCube consoles and software also contributed to the decline.</p>

<p>Prediction-wise, for FY 2005 Nintendo predicts it will sell 12 million <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> units (down from 12.4 million) and slashed their <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=11">GameCube</a> forecast to 2.4 million units, down from 2.8 million.  However, the various incarnations of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a> line are expected to sell 11 million, up from 10.2 million.</p>
