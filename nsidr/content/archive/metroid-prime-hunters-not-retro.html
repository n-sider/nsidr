<p>In somewhat of a shock, N-Philes is <a href="http://www.n-philes.com/e3-2004/articles/EpluFuVpyEjqdGmeKi.php">reporting</a> that <i>Retro Studios</i> is <b>not</b> behind the new <i>Nintendo DS</i> title <i>Metroid Prime: Hunters</i>. Even more surprising is the claim that Retro was completely unaware of Hunters existence until yesterday. Of course this begs the question as to who is behind <i>Metroid Prime: Hunters</i>.</p>
