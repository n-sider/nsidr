<p><ul>
<li>In the last Chibi-Robo, our diminutive hero restored happiness to the Sanderson home,
but in this DS sequel, he's taking on the great outdoors.
<li>Playground equipment in the park is disappearing mysteriously and the flowers in
the park have been transformed by evil monsters. It's up to Chibi-Robo to save
the day and make the park a nice place to visit again.
<li>This time around, Chibi-Robo gets to flex his mechanical muscles in new and
interesting ways. He rides buggies, cars and boats across lawns and ponds, fights
mysterious enemies with his trusty squirter, dances in the park to give life to the
plants there and builds playground equipment to make the park a better place.
