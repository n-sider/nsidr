IGN reports that the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia (IEAA) recently announced that 2007 game industry sales weighed in at $1.3 billion.  This represents a 43% increase from the previous year ($925 million in 2006).<br />
<br />
Independent market research group GfK Australia reported that 15.4 million games were sold in 2007; IGN adds, though, that these figures do not include games purchased via digital distribution.<br />
<br />
The handheld market in Australia saw a major boost in 2007, with 2.3 million Nintendo DS titles jumping off store shelves (as compared to only 840,000 in 2006).<br />
<br />
Nintendo Australia's PR Coordinator, Heather Murphy, commented on the results: "The gaming industry is no longer a niche market; the market has broadened. Nintendo has such a wide variety of games available to cater for everyone - games for the family, core gamers, young females, even seniors."<br />
