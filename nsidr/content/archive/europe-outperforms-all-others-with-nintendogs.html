<p>A <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/press_release.php?aid=14759">rather short press release</a> this morning announces that Nintendo DS juggernaut <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><i>Nintendogs</i></a> has surpassed all other regions with its European sales.</p>

<p>In Europe, the pups have sold two million copies so far, compared to 1 million in Japan and 1.5 million in the US.  Apparently something about the little dogs is clicking with the Europeans, and as the release puts it, with "many female purchasers".</p>
