<p>Tomorrow morning marks the start of the Leipzig Games Convention in Germany.  As <a href=
https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2320">previously reported</a>, Nintendo is kicking things off with a press conference titled "Wii prove our promise" at 10:15 AM.</p>

<p>If you have the endurance, N-Sider would like to invite you to idle in the <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/chat/">N-Forums Chat Room</a> and watch as the speech unfolds.  What time do the festivities begin?  The fun starts at a grueling 3:15am CST/4:15am EST for those in North America.  For others, feel free to use this <a href="http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc">time converter</a> (From Time Zone Europe/Berlin -- To Time Zone ***).  We hope to see you <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/chat/">there</a>...and awake.</p>
