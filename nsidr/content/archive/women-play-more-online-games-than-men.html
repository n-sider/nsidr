Women are more likely than men to play online video games, according to the Global Digital Living survey from market research firm Parks Associates. It was found that women outnumbered male online game players by 28 percent in Europe, 40 percent in North America, and 49 percent in Australia.  Only in Asia was there an insignificant gap between the genders. It was found that 50 percent of men and 49 percent of women surveyed composed the online game playing audience.<br>

"Industry pundits buzz about the large percentage of females gaming online, but many of these gamers are playing free or ad-supported casual card and board games," said Yuanzhe Cai, a senior analyst with Parks Associates. "The revenue-generating genres such as first-person shooters and fantasy games are still dominated by a small group of hard-core male gamers. The gender parity in Asia is unique and may offer insight on how to expand the gaming industry in the western world. Gamers in Asia tend to value the community aspect of the online gaming experience, and the dominant game genres appeal to males and females alike."<br>
