<p>Nintendo announced today that it will bring a new version of <a href="http://n-sider.com/gameview.php?gameid=291"><i>Tetris</i></a>  the game that sold the first <a href="http://n-sider.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=4">Game Boy</a>  to the Nintendo DS before the first quarter of 2006 is up.</p>

<p><i>Tetris DS</i> is, in Nintendo's words, a "new spin on the classic".  Each of the game's six modes of play is themed based on a popular Nintendo franchise, such as Mario, Zelda, or Metroid.  It sounds like Nintendo's opted to not mess with the traditional formula, saying the "traditional Tetriminos and line-clearing strategy remain the staples of the game."  The game also includes touch control, though it's unclear how such an option would work.</p>

<p>Additional game modes include special puzzles to solve as well as head-to-head 2-10 player action, possible in Download Play mode with a single game card.  <i>Tetris DS</i> will also support the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, enabling 2-4 player online matches.</p>

<p><i>Tetris DS</i> is set to release in North America March 20, 2006.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Since the original release, Nintendo's also posted some screenshots of the game for your viewing pleasure.</p>
