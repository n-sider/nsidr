According to <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2006/11/21/104,1164101929,63472,0,0.html">an interview</a> on Famitsu online, upcoming Wii furniture-tossing title <i>Elebits</i> will be the first title to support the console's WiiConnect24 service, which connects Wii consoles in sleep mode to each other and to publishers over the Internet.<br />
<br />
Elebits will use this functionality to permit the exchange of player-designed levels in the game with members of their friend list, as well as in-game photos.  Konami will also be able to send additional game levels to players.<br />
<br />
Elebits releases in Japan on December 8, and sometime in December stateside&mdash;Konami has committed to getting it out in the Wii's launch window, which ends with the new year.
