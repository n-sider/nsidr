<b>The New Nintendo Software Technology Corporation</b><br><br>

The Redmond-Seattle based Nintendo Software Technology Corporation development group was formally established in 1999. The idea and creation behind it was to incorporate Nintendo's funding of Digipen University along with Nintendo of America's desire to have a direct software development arm. The core group was originally composed of a few NOA producers, Digipen professors, and Digipen graduates and students. Winter 2000 saw the fruition of NSTC's first development cycle with the release of Bionic Commando: Elite Forces and Ridge Racer 64. The first batch of software releases were original titles based on foreign IPs not owned by Nintendo, but instead by Capcom and Namco respectively. The aforementioned titles received good reviews by the media. NSTC hit its first blotch by releasing a controversial port of Crystalis for the GBC. NSTC would go on to release other software including Pokemon Puzzle League, Wave Race: Blue Storm, 1080* Avalanche, Mario VS Donkey Kong, Ridge Racer DS, and the upcoming Metroid Prime: Hunters. Aside from individual releases, NSTC has also contributed partially to NCL titles like Nintendo Puzzle Collection, and The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition.<br><br>

In many ways still a work-in-progress, the development group has undergone many changes over the past 18 months. Many of the original founding members have left. <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=531">Andy Hieke</a>, <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1293">Scott K. Tsumura</a>, <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=626">Josh Atkins</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=591">Claude Comair</a> are the bigger names. Former lead programmer (Ridge Racer 64, Wave Rave: Blue Storm) <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=620">Prasanna Ghali</a> has gone back to teaching at Digipen.<br><br>

Nintendo, in response, decided to add several new personnel. Nintendo wanted to bring in some experience and talent with a different perspective than what most of the Digipen-NST disciples were exposed to. The new blood came from all around the world. Some of the recruits were transplanted from Japan's EAD group, while others were lured from third party companies like Electronic Arts and Rockstar. Some new talent from DigiPen and other universities were also added to the mix.<br><br>

Current rumblings report that NSTC has 2-3 development teams in full-force. One confirmed project comes from Richard Vorodi, who is finishing up Metroid Prime: Hunters. The only other title mentioned has been rumored to be a futuristic realistic first-person shooter for the Nintendo Revolution. Nintendo is in dire need of creating first-party software that will attract the American audience for the Revolution launch; it makes sense that they would try to recoup the loss of Goldeneye/Perfect Dark with an original FPS that isn't as alienating as Metroid Prime to the casual gamer. Will we see a Perfect Dark killer from NSTC? We shall see...
