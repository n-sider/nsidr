This week's news from Japan deals mostly with already announced games. There are a few new games from the latest <i>Famitsu</i>, however, and one which should excite fans of developer Treasure. Keep in mind that, unless explicitly stated, none of the games have been announced for a release outside of Japan.<br />
<br />
For Wii there is only one new game announcement and it appears to be entirely based around <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-12.jpg">large trucks</a>, specifically "dekotora". In Japan, dekotora&mdash;short for decoration trucks&mdash;are dump trucks or semi trucks with garishly decorated cabs and trailers, both inside and out. This game appears to feature truck customization and some sort of versus mode, though the details are unknown at the moment.<br />
<br />
Everyone's favorite new Mario game, <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> will <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-8.jpg">utilize</a> Nintendo WFC in some fashion, though the article does not specify how. To make up for it, Princess Peach is <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-9.jpg">confirmed</a> to play a part in the game, alongside the new princess, Rosetta. Super Mario Galaxy is still slated for a November 1 release in Japan. We Americans will see it eleven days later.<br />
<br />
It's not all candy and roses, though. After months of dancing around the topic, it appears that Nintendo has finally officially canceled <i>Project H.A.M.M.E.R</i>.<br />
<br />
The DS news from Famitsu is a little more exciting. Tecmo's <i>Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword</i> is looking <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-6.jpg">as good</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-7.jpg">as ever</a> in the new screenshots which show off more monsters and some hand drawn cutscenes.<br />
<br />
The plotline of Mario's first <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-1.jpg">DS</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-2.jpg">party</a> was revealed this week. In <i>Mario Party DS</i>, Bowser once again wreaks havoc on the Mushroom Kingdom. This time he kidnaps Mario and friends and shrinks them to the size of chess pieces. They must gather up stars to return to their original size and defeat Bowser. The party begins this year on November 9 in Japan and 18 in America.<br />
<br />
From Konami comes <i>Power Pro-kun Pocket 10</i> for DS, with <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-3.jpg">online play</a> and a <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-4.jpg">dictionary mode</a> for beginners. In the West, this series is known as <i>Power Pro Baseball</i>. Japan will see the game December 6.<br />
<br />
Taito announced <i>Space Invaders Extreme</i>, with which they hope to reinvent the Space Invaders formula. Two modes have been revealed so far: feature and fever. Prepare for the invasion come February of next year.<br />
<br />
For those who prefer thinking games, another puzzle game is in the works in Japan. <i>Tashiten: Tashite 10 Ni Suru Monogatari</i> is all about <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-17.jpg">numbers</a>. There are multiple different game types, but they all share the same theme: adding numbers to ten. It's set for an October 10 release, for 4800 yen.<br />
<br />
The <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3035-5.jpg">big news</a> for this week is the revelation of the sequel to Treasure's oft praised shoot 'em up, Bangai-O, which was originally released for the Nintendo 64 in Japan only, but then ported to the Sega Dreamcast and brought to America. <i>Bangaioh Tamashii</i>, or <i>Bangai-O Spirits</i> in English, is a DS release and has two intriguing features: four-player wireless play and a stage editor. Expect a storm of bullets this winter in Japan.<br />
<br />
Finally, Square-Enix revealed the <a href="http://www.square-enix.com/jp/company/j/news/2007/download/20070912_44.pdf">release date</a> for one of the most anticipated remakes in the coming months. <i>Dragon Quest IV</i> will hit Japanese stores November 11, 2007 at the price of 5,490 yen.<br />
<br />
Unless mentioned, none of the above titles have an American release date, yet. As always, thanks to <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=189397">Jonnyram and the rest of NeoGAF</a> for translations and scans.
