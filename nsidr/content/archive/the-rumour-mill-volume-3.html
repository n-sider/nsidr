<p><h2>Volume 3</h2></center>



<p>Welcome to the Rumor Mill, a biweekly feature at N-Sider that covers the latest rumors surrounding everyones favorite videogame company, Nintendo. For those unfamiliar with the Rumor Mill, here is a short history lesson of how it came to be. 



<p>The Rumor Mill was originally a forum thread started in the Events Board by user Jamesc395 to cover rumors relating to E3 2003. Unfortunately, Dean Bergmann (N-sider Technical Support) shut the board down do to lack of interest shortly after the topics creation. Once it became clear that the topic was not going to be revived, I (NR1) took it upon myself to restart it in the General Discussion Board under the name Rumors: The Pre-E3 Storm on May 7, 2003. The topic was an instant success; reaching three pages in eight days with over 90 comments. Shortly after, I started a more permanent topic on August 17, 2003 under the name <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=1165">The Rumor Mill</a>, which can still be viewed at the very top of the General Board.



<p>Now that we got that out of the way, let me explain exactly how the Rumor Mill works. This page, which is the main page, is known as The Mill. This is the place where you can read about the latest rumors and speculation on Nintendo and its products. The second part, which is linked at the bottom, in known as the The Storage Room. The Storage Room is where you can locate any past rumors discussed in the Rumor Mill feature. 



<p>Now lets get this mill turning!

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> CUBE Magazine 

<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> May 2003

<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Unknown

<p>Rev Limit was a racing title originally designed by SETA for the N64 that was described as a fast pace arcade style racer in the same vain as the Ridge Racer series. The title quietly disappeared and was never released; do mainly to the fact that SETA went bankrupt.



<p>Now it seems that Rev Limit may get a second chance at life, only this time on the GameCube. According to CUBE Magazine (May 2003), rumors from insiders suggest that Nintendo or one of its close development houses (NST/ Retro/ Hal Labs/ ect) is hard at work reprogramming the game for the GameCube. 



<p>What proof is there to help establish some partial credibility to this rumor? First, before Rare went running to Billy Gates arms, it was popularly believed that they had a Gran Turismo 3 killer in the works. Unfortunately, no evidence was ever found at Rare that a racing title was in the works.



<p>On August 24, 2000, Nintendo formally unveiled their next-generation hardware (GameCube and Game Boy Advance) at the Nintendo sponsored Spaceworld Expo in Japan. At the event, Nintendo showcased several technical demos that highlighted some of the Cubes graphical capabilities. As it so happens, nearly every one of those tech demos turned out to be real games (Luigis Mansion, Mario 128, Metroid Prime, Perfect Dark Zero [Xbox], and Wave Race: Blue Storm). One of the few presentations that still have no counterpart in game form is a car demo created by EAD. It was suggested early on that <a href="http://www.zoonami.com/rumours.html">Zoonami</a>, a development studio comprised of ex-Rare employees, created the demo, but they adamantly denied these allegations.

<p><i>"We've also seen claims that we're making a Gran Turismo clone, and that the car demo shown at Spaceworld for the GameCube launch was done by us. False, all of them." -Zoonami.com</i>



<p>This fact is very important, because EAD has never been associated with showing demos without having the intention of developing a game based on them. It should be noted, that the tech demo entitled Rebirth was created by Mix-Core, not EAD, which throws out the argument that Rebirth has no game produced after it either. Is this an indication that Rev Limit is alive and kicking?

<p><center><h3><b><a name="ique"><font color="405CC6">Mystery Hardware? I-Que comes to the US?</center></h3></b></a></font>



<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> Satoru Iwata (Nintendo's president)

<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> August 7, 2003

<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Unknown



<p>On August 7, 2003, Satoru Iwata announced Nintendos plans to unveil a new piece of hardware to the public sometime during the spring of 2004 at an investors meeting in Japan. He would not specify if it was the successor to the GameCube or Game Boy Advance, but he did say that <i>[it] will be surprising and unique.</i>



<p>Many gamers speculated that Mr. Iwata was referring to the Game Boys successor, because Sony had announced several key bits of data in relation to their upcoming handheld the PSP. This appears to no be the case though. "It's not likely to be the next generation of handheld or console, said George Harrison, senior vice president of marketing for Nintendo of America, to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/04/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/">CNNMoney</a> on November 5th." 



<p><i>"Nintendo can confirm that a new product is in development." This product will be exhibited at E3 2004. The nature of the product has not been announced. Nintendo can confirm it is not the successor to Nintendo GameCube or Game Boy Advance." - Satoru Iwata, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/13/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/">CNN Money.com</a></i>



<p>Shortly after this interview, Nintendo representative, Jinyou Mori, claimed that Nintendo intends to release an unannounced console during the next year in Japan. The popular belief seems to be that Nintendo is possibly planning to release the Chinese exclusive system, iQue, outside of China. I disagree with this assessment for two major reasons.



<p>First, <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/432/432637p1.html?fromint=1">Satoru Iwata</a> has talked about the iQue on several occasions to the press, and during each of these events he has made it clear that the system is designed solely for the Chinese marketplace and he addressed the mystery hardware as a separate issue.. 



<p><i>"Speaking with financial service Bloomberg, Iwata-san revealed that Nintendo's "iQue" console targeted exclusively at the Chinese market will hit retailers by the end of November. Furthermore, he revealed that Nintendo's next console will be unveiled at E3 2004 next spring with a projected release by the end of 2004." -Recap from Satoru Iwata speech, <a href="http://www.polygonmag.com/news/index.php?id=1185">Polygon Magazine</a></i>



<p>Second, Mr. Mori also stated that a simultaneous worldwide release was the ideal situation for this still mystery hardware. Obviously, the iQue is no longer a possibility because that system was planned for an October 2003 release date in China. Granted, that release has slipped to an unspecified date, but the idea of Nintendo needing, or wanting, to delay the console until late 2004 are just a tad unbelievable. 



<p>Even with these two augments, rumors persist that the iQue will make it outside of China. Those that do believe the mystery hardware is the iQue, point to the fact that the device uses a NTSC output, whereas China is officially designated a PAL territory. 



<p><i>Nintendo spent quite a bit of time and money to come up with the iQue and rumors say that the iQue has been designed by Scott Summit, who also designed for Apple and the Zodiac Handheld device. - <a href="http://www.lik-sang.com/news.php?artc=3198">Lik-Sang.com</a></i>

<p><center><h3><b><a name="Kojima"><font color="405CC6">Hideo Kojima and Miyamoto team up again?</center></h3></b></a></font>

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> Shigeru Miyamoto 

<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> February 2003

<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Unknown



<p>On <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php(que)id=88064">February 28, 2003</a>, Nintendos Shigeru Miyamoto accidentally spilt the beans on a top-secret title being developed in cooperation with Konamis Hideo Kojima. The information came during an interview with the Italian press, when Miyamoto let it slip that he was working closely with Konami to bring a new episode in the famed Tactical Espionage Action franchise, Metal Gear Solid, to the GameCube. 



<p>On May 14, 2003, both game designers stood on Nintendos E3 stage and unveiled a remake of the classic PSone Metal Gear Solid title being developed by developer Silicon Knights. One of the first questions on everyones mind was whether or not the two game masters would work together again in the near future on another title?



<p><i>Nintendo approached Konami with the offer. I had always been a big admirer of Mr. Miyamotos work, but in 17 years I had never been able to work with him or work on a Nintendo system. - Hideo Kojima, Nintendo Power </i>



<p>In recent years, Nintendo has started to loan several of their top rated franchises that they have been unable to work on and barrow a few third party titles. Sega has had the opportunity to create a F-Zero title, Namco is currently producing a Donkey Kong and Star Fox title, and Capcom has been given limited control of the Zelda license. So far, Nintendo has developed a game based on Namcos Pac-Man and Konamis Metal Gear, but Konami hasnt had the liberty of making use of a Nintendo franchise yet. 



<p>On <a href="http://www.cube-europe.com/news.php?nid=3936">March 28th</a>, Miyamoto again allowed a little too much information be reveled about his on going relationship with Mr. Kojima. In an interview with Nintendos official French magazine, he announced that Hideo Kojima has another title in the works exclusively for the Cube. We know for a fact that Miyamoto is involved with this title in some way, but to what degree and exactly what game is still a mystery. 



<p><i>I spoke out of turn I suppose [laughs]. Yeah, we're actually working on a couple of projects with Mr. Kojima--he's working on his new Game Boy Advance project. - Shigeru Miyamoto, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/driving/mariokartdoubledash/news_2911878-2.html">GameSpot.com</a></i>



<p>Little else is known about this arrangement, but we do know that both companies are eager to work together again soon. On December 12th, <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/445/445991p1.html">IGNcube</a> interviewed Silicon Knights president, Denis Dyack, about the status of Twin Snakes. In that interview, Dyack had something rather encouraging to say about Kojima and Miyamoto.



<p><i>IGNcube: Will there be more Metal Gear titles on Nintendo home consoles? 



<p>Denis: Well, I hope so! In our opinion, Kojima-san's group is one of the best in the world and an ongoing relationship between Nintendo and Konami would be a great thing in our opinion. I personally would love to see Socrates (Kojima-san) and Aristotle (Miyamoto-san) continue to work together in the future. This would be good for gamers and good for our industry. </i>



<p>Those familiar with Mr. Dyacks language and comments from the past will know that some sort of cryptic message is actually being said here. What is it, you ask? I can't say with 100% certainty, so I really feel that I cant outright tell you what it is. However, I will give you a huge hint. Both Socrates and Aristotle are well known figures of Greek philosophy, and it just so happens that Nintendo has a little known game starring an angel in a land based on Greek mythology
