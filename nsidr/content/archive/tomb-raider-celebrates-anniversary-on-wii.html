Eidos Interactive announced the development of <i>Tomb Raider Anniversary</i> for Wii.  Eidos did not commit to a release date, although the PlayStation 2 version is scheduled to arrive in June.  The company said it will spend extra time tailoring the game's control to the Wii remote.<br />
<br />
Traditionally Eidos has avoided releasing games on Nintendo platforms citing creative competition from Nintendo as a precluding factor.  "Eidos in the past kind of avoided Nintendo," Bill Gardner, president and CEO of Eidos Interactive, told <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/788/788338p1.html">IGN.com</a> in an interview.  However, he admits Eidos has begun to warm up to Nintendo platforms after the success of <i>Lego Star Wars</i> and </i>Tomb Raider Legend</i> on GameCube.  <br />
<br />
Gardner hopes Tomb Raider Anniversary will again strike a chord with the Nintendo audience.  He explained, "I think this is the beginning of what I hope will be our taking the franchise in multiple directions, much in the way that it has happened with other franchises out there in the sense that we want to discover what works on Wii and go that path with Tomb Raider."<br />
<br />
Eidos' first North American Wii release will come in June, when it publishes <i>Escape from Bug Island</i>.
