Nintendo will soon push out three new classic games to the Wii Shop Channel for the Virtual Console service.  They are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Punch Out!! Featuring Mr. Dream</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Virtua Fighter 2</i> (Sega Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Bonk's Revenge</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
As usual, the games are scheduled to go up at 9 a.m. Pacific time.  If any of the titles interest you (even sans Mike Tyson), head on over to the Wii Shop Channel at that time and spend some Wii Points.  Wii Points currently go for 100 for about $1.
