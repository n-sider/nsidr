<p>Game designer <a href="http://www.americanmcgee.com/wordpress/">American McGee</a> said Wii is the "only true next-gen console" in an interview with <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=144515">C&VG</a>.  McGee's answer is in response to a question about the prospects of the next-generation of consoles.</p>

<p>"The only truly next-gen console out there is the Wii," he said.  "Everything else is just a video card and processor upgrade. I sense that Nintendo is going to capture the hearts of gamers while Microsoft and Sony stab each other in the neck for market domination. Nintendo is focused on innovation and games. The other guys are focused on making money."</p>

<p>It appears McGee shares Nintendo's view.  Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> has said in the past that Nintendo is looking to create a 'new generation'. "Nintendo is not working on a next-generation console," he said.  "Next-generation implies that the console is an extension of previous installments. We believe that extending our current line will not lead to larger markets, and could possibly even lead to smaller markets."</p>

<p>McGee primarily develops games for the PC, known for titles such as American McGee's Alice and Scrapland.  His latest title is Bad Day LA, a curious take on how government uses fear to control its citizens. Two other titles are in concept stages; they include American McGee's Oz and American McGee's Grimm.  Production of Oz has been put on hold, which according to Wikipedia, McGee has attributed to publishers being afraid of new ideas and products without familiar names.</p>
