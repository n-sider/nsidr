<p>CV&G conducted an interview with Microsoft corporate vice president and chief XNA architect J Allard.  He was questioned about the unveiling of the new Nintendo DS.  An excerpt is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p>What do you think of Nintendo's new handheld?</p>

<p>Allard: The DS? That touch-screen thing? Awesome. Awesome.</p> 

<p>Have you had a go on it yourself?</p>

<p>Allard: No I haven't touched it, but it's just genius. I think it's a great, great, great idea. I didn't understand the dual-screen thing, the Metroid map, blah blah blah, whatever. I think that touch-screen is going to revolutionise the way kids communicate. I think it's text-messaging for kids. They're gonna scribble notes in class or on the bus on wireless network and stuff. It's going to be awesome. But I think its for the same demographic that the Game Boy is.</p>
