<p>Namco's Nintendo DS Pac-Pix Japanese website has also opened.  There are several interesting game screens and character art to browse.  Check out the website <a href="http://www.namco-ch.net/pac-pix/index.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you whose native language is not Japanese, we would suggest using the text translator <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/">AltaVista Babel Fish</a>.</p>
