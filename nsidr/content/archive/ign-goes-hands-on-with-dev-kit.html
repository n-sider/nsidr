<p>Although no actual software was tested, Matt Casamassina and the IGN crew recently had a chance to go <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/694/694785p1.html">hands-on</a> with Revolution's controller-based development kit. From the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>The freehand-style remote included in the preliminary kit is neither as well produced nor as finalized as the slick hardware Nintendo has showcased in official photos. It's not wireless, for starters. But even from a visual standpoint, it's different, sporting a grayish color and a flimsy, plastic-like design. It's much lighter in the hands than we had anticipated, which makes sense given that it doesn't use batteries.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's worth noting that this dev-kit (as well as the majority of previous kits) is essentially powered by a Gamecube with slightly enhanced specs, and forces developers to focus on gameplay first and foremost for the time-being.</p>

<blockquote><p>Most software houses working with this kit have only a vague idea about what to expect from Revolution where horsepower is concerned. Studio sources regularly reiterate previously reported projections that the hardware will be roughly twice as powerful as GameCube.</p></blockquote>

<p/>Stay tuned to N-Sider for more as it develops.
