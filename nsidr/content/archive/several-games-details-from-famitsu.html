<p>Courtesy 4ColorRebellion comes a <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/01/15/famitsu-scans-on-the-menu/">collection of new scans from Famitsu</a> revealing the shape of the 2006 gaming world to come &mdash; in Japan, at least.</p>

<p>First off, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=968"><i>Polarium</i></a> developer Mitchell has been hard at work at a new puzzle game for the Nintendo DS called PuzzLoop, while Taito will be bringing <i>Cooking Mama</i> &mdash; you guessed it, a cooking game.</p>

<p>Taito's action RPG <i>Lost Magic</i> is also looking pretty good, and will be offering online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Finally, <i>Baten Kaitos 2</i> &mdash; <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1653">rumored to be released stateside this year</a> &mdash; makes an appearance sporting a lot of new cards and several pretty new screenshots.</p>
