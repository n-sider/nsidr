<center><h3>Nintendo Marketing History</h3></center>

<p>Nintendo's yearly marketing budget consists of more $$$ than the majority of us could ever imagine.  Just think, if you had the - on average - $100 million Nintendo spends to market its games each holiday season, you could buy 2,000,000 copies of Super Mario Sunshine each at a full retail price of $50.  That's an amazing number, however it's a necessary part of being in such a competitive industry.  Nintendo not only has to market multiple hardware systems but also dozens of games each year.  This is a close look at those expenses Nintendo has endured over the years.</p>
