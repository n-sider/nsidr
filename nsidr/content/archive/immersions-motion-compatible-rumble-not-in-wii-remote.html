<p>Immersion Corp., recently headline-makers for their legal action against Sony for the DUALSHOCK rumble technology in the PlayStation 2, is being talked about again.</p>

<p>Immersion's TouchSense technology reportedly allows for force feedback to be used in motion-sensitive controllers; at this past E3, Sony dropped force feedback from the PlayStation 3 because they said it conflicted with the controller's newly-announced motion sensitivity.  Immersion president and CEO Vic Viegas <a href="http://wii.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3151621">told 1UP</a> he believed Immersion could help Sony re-add this feature if they moved quickly.</P>

<p>Nintendo's Wii Remote, on the other hand, features both motion sensitivity and rumble.  Immersion hasn't had a hand in this; the technology has been developed by Nintendo without Immersion's assistance.  1UP speculates Immersion may be giving the Wii Remote a very close look when they're able to get their hands on one to see if their methods violate any of Immersion's patents&mdash;which has the potential to land Nintendo in legal action not unlike that which Sony has already faced over DUALSHOCK.</p>
