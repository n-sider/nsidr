<p>Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service has lured more than 2 million unique players, about 10 percent of the Nintendo DS userbase, online.  This landmark number was reached last Thursday.  Nintendo calculates from these two million users, nearly 70 million connections have been made with available games such as <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/AnimalCrossingGamingHub.jsp">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/MarioKartGamingHub.jsp">Mario Kart DS</a>, and <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/TetrisDSGamingHub.jsp">Tetris DS</a>.</p> 

<p>It was only five months ago on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1808">March 7</a> that Nintendo tallied the one-millionth user and 26 million total connections.  The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service launched with the release of Mario Kart on November 14, 2005.</p>

<p>Upcoming online-compatible games for the Nintendo DS include Star Fox Command (August 28), Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis (September 25), and Clubhouse Games (October 9).  Nintendo's next-generation console Wii will also be jumping online with its release later this year, of which more details will arrive soon.</p>
