Activision has gained the rights to develop RPGs using the intellectual properties the Marvel universe provides.  This is, of course, in addiction, to the rights Activision already holds which has allowed them to release games based on Spider-Man and, more recently, The Fantastic Four.  The first game in this agreement should release sometime in 2007.

What immediately leaps to mind here is a game starring a young boy who is going to become a superhero and along the way he gets help from Spider-Man and pals.  Let's hope that Activision comes up with something more interesting.
