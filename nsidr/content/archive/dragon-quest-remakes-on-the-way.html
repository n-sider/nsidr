The latest <i>Shounen Jump</i> revealed completely unsurprising but still big news: Square-Enix has Dragon Quest remakes in the works for DS. <br />
<br />
<i>Dragon Quest IV</i> is first to get a makeover and is set for a vague release period of Winter 2007 in Japan. <i>Dragon Quest V</i> and <i>Dragon Quest VI</i> will follow, completing the trilogy within the long-running, immensely popular RPG series.
