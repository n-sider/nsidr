Following up to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2966">his Aonuma interview</a>, Wired's Chris Kohler today posted his time with Shigeru Miyamoto, discussing a number of topics from <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>'s design to Wii peripherals.<br />
<br />
Most newsworthy, though, are two tidbits.  The first is that although we were told the Balance Boards shown at E3 weren't production models, the Balance Board is in fact in production in Japan with an eye toward a 2007 release of <i>Wii Fit</i>.  Also, asked about <i>Wii Music</i>, which didn't appear at the show, Miyamoto said "I kind of focus on games in order, one by one. I'm focused on [Nintendo's E3 showings] right now. So I'm thinking Wii Music might be good for next year sometime. Mario Kart, as well."<br />
