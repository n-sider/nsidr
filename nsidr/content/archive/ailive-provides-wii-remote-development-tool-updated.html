Nintendo has partnered with AiLive to provide its LiveMove artificial intelligence technology to Wii developers. LiveMove recognizes motions made with the Wii remote and records this data for development use.  AiLive says, "LiveMove lets developers focus directly on creative work without the burden of onerous coding requirements, helping them quickly unleash the potential of Wii."<br />

<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a>, Senior Managing Director/General Manager of Integrated Research & Development Division said that in early 2006, "I challenged Dr. Wei Yen and his AI scientists to develop AIware for the Wii Remote. When Nintendo's development teams saw LiveMove, we instantly recognized how it would greatly increase our ability to explore and experiment with new concepts and make our lives easier.  This revolutionary tool liberates the imaginations of game creators. We are more than happy to share this collaborative LiveMove tool with independent Wii software developers all over the world. From a cowboy's lasso to a samurai's sword or a chef's cooking utensils, we just can't wait to play the developers' new, 'unexpected' applications."<br />
