<p>Nintendo is scheduled to have three consecutive worldwide media events over the next several days beginning tomorrow in Japan, followed closely by events in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>N-Sider's very own Anthony JC has received an invitation to the New York event on Thursday.  He'll be arriving early to hear Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> discuss Nintendo's upcoming holiday season.  Afterwards, he'll hang around and get nearly six hours of hands-on time with upcoming Nintendo games.  Wii games specifically will be presented as well as several other pieces of highly-anticipated news.  This is expected to be a significant event and so we've created countdowns to the respective show times.</p>

<p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-09-13-wiicountdown.html">Japan</a> <font size="1">(unknown)</font>
<li><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-09-13-wiicountdown2.html">America</a> <font size="1">(Thursday 10:00AM - 4:00PM EST)</font>
<li><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-09-13-wiicountdown3.html">Europe</a> <font size="1">(Friday 11:00AM - 5:00PM UTC/GMT +1 hour)</font>
  </ul></p>

<p>If the countdowns aren't working properly for you and have left you befuddled, don't worry, we'll give you a heads up through a news story an hour in advance of each conference.</p>

<p>We'd also like to invite you to relax and discuss the events in the <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/chat/">N-Forums Chat Room</a>.  Arrive early and get yourself a good seat.</p>
