<b><a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/734/734721p1.html">IGN</a> says</b> (8.2/10),<br>
"The addition of four player battles alone makes Clash of Ninja 2 a worthy purchase, as the already frantic fighter is now doubled in intensity. Team fights are a blast to play, and the 3-on-1 fights are brutal as well, pitting the best player in your party against everyone else simultaneously. In addition, the cast of characters has more than doubled in size, and the overall play time needed to unlock the vault of extras will range in the 20+ hr range. The game offers multiple story modes, survival mode, time trials, classic arcade mode, as well as a deceptively deep four player mode."

"Overall, Naruto 2 provides a good-sized roster of characters, an entertaining story mode, and an excellent four player mode that makes the game perfect for playing with friends. While it's still doesn't have the depth or quality of a real fighting game, as a party fighter it's earned its qualifications in spades. Those who often play multiplayer and are fans of Naruto should definitely check this game out."
