<p><b>Battle B-Daman - Game Boy Advance</b>

<p><ul>
<li>Yamato Delgado dreams of playing B-Daman, the ancient sport of the B-DaWorld&mdash;and his dream comes true when he's chosen to wield Cobalt Blade, the most powerful B-Daman ever. Yamato must use Cobalt Blade to compete in B-Daman tournaments and defeat the evil B-Daplayers of the Shadow Alliance, who will stop at nothing to take over the B-DaWorld. Yamato will also meet characters both familiar and unknown on his journeys, including the warm-hearted Alan and the sinister-looking Goblin. Only a few have what it takes to become a B-Daplayer; will Yamato become the B-Dachampion?
<li>Three modes of play: Battle, Custom, and Adventure!
<li>Over a dozen battlefields and 18 selectable characters!
<li>Two-player simultaneous action!
<li>All the fun and excitement of the best-selling toys in a video game format!
  </ul></p>
