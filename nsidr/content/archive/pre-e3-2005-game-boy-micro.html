<p>At Nintendo's press conference earlier this morning, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie</a>, revealed Nintendo's newest redesign of the Game Boy Advanced - The Game Boy Micro. Not much is known about the Game Boy Micro, other than Nintendo's claim that it looks to be brightest screen in a Nintendo portable to date.<p>

<p>Reggie also said that it would be "a hair bigger and two-thirds the weight of an iPod Mini." and is scheduled to be released in North America sometime in the Fall.<p>
