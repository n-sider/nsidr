<p>Japanese magazine Famitsu asked readers which next-generation console is most interesting to them.  The results are as follows:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Nintendo Revolution: 42%
<li>Sony PlayStation 3: 39%
<li>Microsoft Xbox 360: 18%
  </ul></p>

<p>Reasons for their interest in Revolution include the small and unique design, the download possibility of old Famicom (NES) and Super Famicom (SNES) games, the "revolution" the console may cause, and finally the other mysteries of the console including the controller.</p>

<p>PlayStation 3 interests respondents for its highly technical specs, backwards-compatibility with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, the design of the console and controller and finally the Cell and Blu-Ray aspects of the machine.</p>

<p>Respondents were interested in Xbox 360 because they are looking forward to the developers such as Akira Toriyama, Square Enix has announced support, and because the name, color and design of the console is better than the first Xbox.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts also currently has a poll on its website asking which console users will buy.  Although the results have since been tampered with by several gaming forums giving Revolution 50 percent of votes, PlayStation 3 30 percent of votes and Xbox 360 19 percent of votes, more accurate data from May 30 out of 23,421 votes showed the following results:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Nintendo Revolution: 10%
<li>Sony PlayStation 3: 57%
<li>Microsoft Xbox 360: 32%
  </ul></p>
