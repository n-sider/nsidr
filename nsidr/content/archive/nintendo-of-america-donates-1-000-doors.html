<p>Nintendo of America has donated 1,000 doors according to Habitat for Humanity International to help the nonprofit homebuilding organization build houses across the state of Florida.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><font size="2"><i>"Nintendo's generosity reflects the spirit of the organization," said Dick Weber, regional director for Habitat for Humanity International's Southeast Regional Service Center, which includes Florida. "The gift of 1,000 doors will open new doors for families in need across Florida - families who have the same dreams as most Americans do, to someday have a simple, decent home to call their own."</i></font></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nintendo made the donation in honor of the release of <i>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</i>. Habitat for Humanity affiliates will use the doors in home building projects across the state of Florida, working toward its goal to build a record 1,000 houses in the state this year. Lowe's Home Improvement, a national partner with Habitat for Humanity International, supported this donation by providing the doors to Nintendo at a discount.</p>
