<p>The Nintendo DS is in very high demand in Japan this season  so much so that Nintendo <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/owabi/index.html">has issued an apology</a> for not being able to keep up with demand.</p>

<p>The apology is for both customers and shop owners, and promises to ship new stock via air mail to get the units in the shops sooner.  Shipments are occurring weekly, and supply is expected to pick back up come the end of January.</p>
