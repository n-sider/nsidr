Konami has announced that the team behind furniture-tossing launch title <i>Elebits</i>, led by Shingo Mukaitoge, is <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/760/760682p1.html">at work</a> on a brand new Wii exclusive titled <i>Dewy's Adventure</i>.<br />
<br />
Dewy, the player-controlled character, is a droplet of water sent on a mission to defeat Don Hedron, who wants to cover the world in darkness.  The game is controlled using a sideways-held Wii Remote, which the player can tilt to tilt the world and move Dewy.  The directional pad can heat or cool Dewy; the former turns him into a cloud of steam that can create lightning strikes to attack enemies with.  Mukaitoge also said the heating/cooling mechanic could be used to solve environmental puzzles, and additional moves were available such as fanning the controller to create wind or moving it side-to-side to create an earthquake.<br />
<br />
Like Elebits, Dewy's Adventure will also feature a level editor.  Though Mukaitoge confirmed the title will use WiiConnect24, he did not say how it would be used yet; however it seems safe to connect the dots and say that custom levels could be shared with friends using this feature.  A multiplayer mode is also in the works, which may be two or four players depending on how development goes.<br />
<br />
Dewy's Adventure is planned for a 2007 release.
