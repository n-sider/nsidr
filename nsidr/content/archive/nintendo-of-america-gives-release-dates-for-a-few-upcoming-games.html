<p>Nintendo of America has updated their release list for the second quarter of the year. The following are tentative release dates for upcoming first party Nintendo games for both the GameCube (GCN) and Game Boy Advance (GBA):
<ul>
<li>03/22/04 GCN Pokmon Colosseum
<li>04/05/04 GCN WarioWare Inc.: Mega Party Games
<li>05/10/04 GCN Custom Robo
<li>05/24/04 GBA Mario vs. Donkey Kong
<li>06/28/04 GBA Mario Golf: Advance Tour
  </ul>

<p>It should be noted that <i>Pikmin 2</i> is no where to be found despite Nintendo giving it a tentative Q2 2004 (Quarter 2) release date last September. Though unconfirmed, this could be indication that the title will suffer yet another delay. More as it becomes available.
