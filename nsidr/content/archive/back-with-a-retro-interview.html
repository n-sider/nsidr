<p>I apologize for my absence the past two weeks but I've been on vacation, visiting family and camping along the coast of Washington and Oregon.  Bear with me while I get back into the swing of things.  Regular news updates should resume, as well I've got a wealth of retro interviews lined up - one every single day for the next month.</p>
