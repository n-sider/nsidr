Super Monkey Ball Adventure is on its way to the Nintendo GameCube.  Under development by Traveller's Tales (makers of Lego Star Wars and recent Crash Bandicoot titles), the game takes a new twist on the Super Monkey Ball formula. Previous Monkey Ball titles were developed by Sega's Amuzement Vision studio.  Super Monkey Ball Adventure is described as a story-driven adventure containing a mix of platforming and puzzles.  Updated graphics, over 50 puzzle levels and six party games  -- in addition to the new adventure worlds -- will be included.  Furthermore, there will be a selection of monkey-containment balls featuring such abilities as being able to stick to walls, float across crevices or turn invisible.
