I recently had the honor of posing a few questions to NowPro producer Michiteru Okabe about recent Empire release <i>Unsolved Crimes</i>.  If you're interested in the game, check out <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6349&view=review">our full review</a>.<br />

<div class="align_left"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3788-1.jpg" width="170" height="102" class="image_styled" /></div><b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> What inspired you to make <i>Unsolved Crimes</i>?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Michiteru Okabe:</span></b> I would say a great deal of my inspiration came from adventure games, and some I attribute to <i>Professor Layton</i>.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> What kind of person do you think would enjoy the game the most?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> We'd like everyone to enjoy our game, but especially mystery game fans.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Why the New York theme? I got a very 70's-cop-show vibe from the whole thing. It was amusing, in a cheesy sort of way.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> We thought the best place to create a variety of crime scenes was in a 1970's New York setting. I think it makes it fun and engaging.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Tell us a little more about the characters. Abbot's my favorite, primarily for his lines.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> Abbot is my favorite character too! He's a dedicated cop, worked himself up the ranks and doesn't like for people to know he has a soft side. And Ponzini is also our team favorites because one of our staff members looks just like him.<br />
<br />
Then there's Warren Sullivan, the modeling agency owner who has a fascination with guns and gangsters. Marcy Blake, Betsy's sister, is soft on the outside and a tough cop on the inside. Betsy is a waitress and model who has gone missing and who our story focuses around.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3788-2.jpg" width="170" height="255" class="image_styled" /></div><b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> I noticed a bit of a brain-training influence, with the difficulty levels for each query and the scoring pentagon with the "intellectual", "inspiration", "observation", "physical", and "decisiveness" axes. Tell us more about what's behind that.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> We at NowPro think there's a needs for a game design customized for DS players since the birth and boom of the <i>Brain Age</i> games. <i>Unsolved Crimes</i> is a start targeting the core DS audience, but I think the genre still has a lot of opportunity.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> How do you feel the game plays to your studio's strengths? I found out you were the guys behind puzzler <i>Intelligent License</i> for the PSP, for example; how did experience like that translate to <i>Unsolved Crimes</i>?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> Certainly, some of the members who developed <i>Intelligent License</i> were part of the <i>Unsolved Crimes</i> development team providing their puzzle game expertise and input. Their experience was definitely an asset when it came to designing the difficulty levels for the quizzes.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Has it come out in Japan? Are there plans to release it there if not?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> A Japanese version is very likely. So far we have only released the title in the US and Europe.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Are other games on the way? Are you or would you like to make a franchise out of this title?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> If people like the game, definitely! We would love the possibility of making a franchise out of it.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Thanks for your time and letting me play your game. Best of luck to you, both with <i>Unsolved Crimes</i> and in the future.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Okabe:</span></b> The pleasure was all mine. Thank you very much.
