<p>The latest issue of Japan's Weekly Famitsu magazine reports that Nintendo is concluding the Famicom Mini Game Boy Advance series after the release of the third volume, which was announced earlier this week.  Although no official reason was given, it's likely that Nintendo doesn't want to oversaturate the market with nostalgic game titles in such a short period of time (or perhaps Nintendo feels it's already released the best titles from the NES/Famicom period).  It's also unknown if Nintendo will continue the series at a later date.</p>
