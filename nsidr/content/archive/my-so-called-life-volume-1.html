<h3>My So-Called Life: Volume 1</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mysocalledlife_header.jpg"></p>

<p>Veteran readers of N-Sider.com should at least know two things about 

us: we only write for the site because of our unhealthy obsession with 

Nintendo; and that Ive been a part of the N-Sider family for a number of 

years now. For the benefit of new readers, I think I better introduce 

myself, my situation, and this column.  

<p>If you havent guessed already, this is the first edition of a new 

column series. The intention is to give you a glimpse into the gaming 

habits of yours truly. Ill be talking about games Im playing, sharing my 

opinions on the movers and shakers of the gaming industry, and letting you 

all know how things are going with me (without sordid details, those are 

Deans territory in the forums!). Itll be different, all about gaming, 

maybe some other stuff too, and Im Australian so thats loads of 

entertainment right there. There are far too many Americans and Canadians 

on the N-Sider staff so its about time other countries and continents 

shared in the spotlight. James (Burns, the first and other Australian 

staff member) and I have tried to give the site some Australian flavour, 

but the way it is, is the way it is.  North American and Japanese markets 

obviously take precedence, but we mustnt forget those other markets and 

the legions of Nintendo fans from there.

<p>Now then, for those that dont know too much about me, Im one of two 

Australian correspondents of this largely North American-based website. 

Ive dabbled in some of the existing columns and Ive been a part of a 

rather hefty number of stand-alone articles over the years. I was born and 

raised in the worlds most liveable city, Melbourne, and over the course 

of my lifetime Ive seen my passion for Nintendo rise from the wondrous 

beginnings of Game & Watch to the extraordinary obsession of all things 

Nintendo, hardware and software. You name the system, and Ive got it 

(with the exception of Virtual Boy which never came out in Australia) and 

Ill gladly part with my hard-earned dollars to buy anything Nintendo 

designs and releases in the future. However, all of this is nothing new to 

most of the staff and many of our readers.

<p>This year, I left my homeland in early May to begin a 12-month journey 

of a lifetime. The destination was North America, a continent that was on 

my to-do list of things to do before it was too late. I arrived in Los 

Angeles on May 9th, Mothers Day, (thankfully I have family there so I got 

free accommodation) and a little event by the name of E3 (the Electronics 

Entertainment Expo) was only days away. Needless to say, E3 was like a 

dream coming true. Anyway, May 29th was when I got myself to Vancouver, 

British Columbia, Canada, which was to be home for the next year.  Long 

story short, Im currently still here (its currently October 2004 for 

those blissfully unaware) and enjoying being in a different place to 

Melbourne with such a different culture and way of life, but thats 

another story for another edition of this column.

<p>Thats my gaming history in a nutshell. The real meat of this first 

edition is to talk about something quite serious and something Im sure 

others have either gone through or are currently going through. You see, I 

lost interest in portable gaming. Even worse, I lost interest in a 

Nintendo system and, worst of all, I lost interest in Nintendos games! It 

was blasphemy and I needed to do something about it. The story goes 

something like this:

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mysocalledlife_yawn.jpg"></p>

<p>Ever since I sold my GBA for the ultra-sexy GBA SP model, I found 

myself barely playing any games on the system simply because I hardly 

brought it with me wherever I went and that was combined with a perceived 

(in my horrendously underestimated opinion) lack of worthy games to play.

<p>Rewinding back to the launch of the GBA, I was excited to be playing 

the likes of <i>F-Zero Maximum Velocity</i> and a curious title called 

<i>Kuru Kuru Kururin</i>. Moving forward to the launch of the GBA SP and 

up to that point Id only added <i>Super Mario World</i>, <i>The Legend of 

Zelda: A Link to the Past</i>, <i>Yoshis Island</i>, <i>Castlevania: 

Harmony of Dissonance</i>, and <i>Pokemon Ruby</i> to my completed 

gaming collection. Seven games in that timeframe isnt a whole lot (for 

me) and almost not worth my money buying the system in the first place. 

Especially when you consider that three of them are SNES remakes and 

another is essentially an updated version of a Game Boy game. Hmmm

<p>Throw in <i>Metroid Fusion</i> and <i>Metroid: Zero Mission</i> into 

the mix from the time I got my SP up until E3 2004 and you can see the 

downward spike in GBA-playtime that has eventuated and how sad the 

situation really was. <i>Wario Ware</i> was but a blip in the radar by 

this point, something I just dabbled in but never really got that into 

until a friendly GameCube play session with the N-Sider crew at E3 

changed my opinion of it, but still I barely played it on the GBA.

<p>Thankfully, things have now changed. With a new job and a morning and 

evening commute to and from work, I have a fresh new outlook on things. 

Suddenly I have an excuse to carry around my SP and plenty of time to play 

the new (and old) games.  Thanks to the new situation, Ive been able to 

blow the dust off my SP and rediscover just why the Game Boy Advance is a 

special piece of hardware. My handheld passion was at a crossroads, and I 

have built a bridge and gotten over it.  What you are about to read are 

the reasons why:

<h4>Mario Golf: Advance Tour</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mysocalledlife_mariogolf.jpg"></p>

<p>It might be to you, but its no secret to me how much I love playing 

golf in real-life and how much I love playing golf in videogame form. From 

<i>Golf</i> (NES), to <i>Everybodys Golf</i> (PSOne), to <i>Mario 

Golf</i> (N64 and GBC), to <i>Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour</i> (GCN) and 

<i>Tiger Woods PGA Tour</i> (XBX), Ive seen my fair share of golf games 

over the years. Camelot defined button press golf on the PlayStation and 

Nintendo 64, refined it on GameCube, and hit a home run on the Game Boy 

Advance.

<p>With its amazing range of shots, shot control, character development, 

mini-games, tournaments and match-play modes, <i>Mario Golf: Advance 

Tour</i> is a tour-de-force of a game. Its filled with so much charm and 

playability that it demands the player invests hours upon hours of 

gameplay into it. For the better part of a month, on those daily train 

rides in the morning and evening, <i>Advance Tour</i> has consumed me to 

the point where I almost didnt notice that hot chick sitting on the other 

side of the carriage or that little boy I made jealous because I was 

playing a GBA. Look Mom, hes got a GameBoy SP, he said. Can I get one 

for Christmas?, he begged. Well see, said the mother. Next thing you 

know hes hovering around me trying to see what game Im playing  Ha ha, 

I think to myself! =P

<p>Its almost a relief when its all over and you check your characters 

stats and realize just how far youve come, how much time and effort 

youve put into it, and you just know that it was all worth it. However, 

just like a good book, you wish there was just one more chapter, one more 

page, one more sentence  anything so you can play it once more. It just 

has that addictive nature to its gameplay and Nintendo magic to boot. 

Camelot has outdone itself, but left me with one aching question: when is 

the Nintendo DS (and/or Revolution) version coming out?

<p>I finished it, eventually. I needed something new to play; I needed 

something else to pass the time on those train rides. <i>Mario Golf</i> 

had run its course, and I needed to clear my to play list. Guess what 

game got the prize?

<p>You guessed it: <i>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</i>. I had been looking for an 

excuse to get the cobwebs off the cartridge, and now that I suddenly had 

all this free time again I was sold.

<h4>Mario Vs. Donkey Kong</h4>

<p align="center"><img 

src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mysocalledlife_marioanddonkeykong.jpg"></p>

<p>Initially when I got it, I played the first three levels and quickly 

got bored. It wasnt the game I thought it would be; I thought I wanted 

another action-packed platform game like <i>Super Mario World</i> or 

<i>Super Mario Bros. 3</i>. I didnt think I wanted an accomplished 

platform/puzzle game hybrid. I learned one thing then and that was that 

sometimes you should ignore what you think you want and try something 

again.

<p>Im now a total convert. Mario himself displays his trademark deftness 

with the platforms, his amazing repertoire of moves, and his wonderful 

willingness to do what he has to against an enemy looking to ruin his 

fun-time. Taking quirky bits from both the Donkey Kong and Mario 

universes, youll find plenty of in-jokes and set-pieces from both. 

Strangely, with the melding of the two universes and a sprinkling of 

puzzle-game philosophy into it, the outcome is an amazingly good game.

<p>Ive completed it, only to be confronted with another 6 + worlds to 

play with.  Donkey Kong has proven to be a formidable foe in this game, 

especially with some of his boss battles in the + worlds.  Im almost 

there, and this game is one of those that is good enough to make you WANT 

to make it to the end.

Those first three levels that I gave it didnt do it justice. Now I can 

backflip to my hearts content, I can pick up and throw enemies to my 

advantage, find and nurture my little-Marios to safety. I can flip 

switches with the best of them and I can do it all in a timeframe that 

ensures I earn that out-of-reach star.

<p>NSTC have come up with a corker with this one. Quietly unassuming, it 

is definitely a case of more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts and one of those 

understated gems that you simply must add to your collection.

<h4>Two Games + New outlook = Passion re-instated.</h4>

<p align="center"><img 

src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mysocalledlife_passionreinstated.jpg"></p>

<p>Two games. Thats all it took to rekindle my waning GBA passion, I 

reached an impasse and got through it with flying colours. Handheld 

gaming, to me, was almost at a point where I was going through the motions 

 getting GBA SP just because and GBA games purely because I needed a 

reason why I had the SP in the first place  but with the increase in 

available playtime and the rekindled passion, Im now at bursting point 

for that thing you see on the horizon. It has two letters, it is portable, 

and it has Nintendo emblazoned all over it. Thats right! Nintendo DS, I 

look forward to taking you with me on my daily commutes. The GBA may not 

be dead, but I know what Ill be playing on the train.

<p>I want to hear Look Mom, hes got a DS! Can I have one for Christmas? 

Pleeeeaaaaassse Mom!?!?!??  That thing is so awesome!!
