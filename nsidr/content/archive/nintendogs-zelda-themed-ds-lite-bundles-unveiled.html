Depending on which bundle you get, you'll get a copy of either <i>Nintendogs: Best Friends Edtion</i> or <i>Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>.  The bundles have been rumored for some time, with the Zelda-themed Lite showing up at the Nintendo World Store and leaks from retailers' Black Friday ads showing them off.
