Scans of the newest Jump are in courtesy of the never-asleepers over at <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=133531" target="_blank">GAF</a> and they bring some exciting news:<br />
<br />
In addition to the previously announced <i>Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</i> for the Nintendo DS, a new game called <i>Final Fantasy Tactics A2: The Sealed Grimoire</i> is on the way.  Though a target platform has not been officially announced, speculation is heavy toward the DS or perhaps even the Game Boy Advance, due to the "A2" part of the title, which might indicate it is a sequel to the Nintendo-exclusive <i>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</i> series.<br />

Along with a PSP port of the original FFT, these three games make up what Square-Enix is calling the "Ivalice Alliance."  No screens or many details on <i>Grimoire</i> are available yet, just this portion of the scan announcing the game:<br />
