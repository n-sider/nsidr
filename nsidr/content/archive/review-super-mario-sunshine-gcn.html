<b>Super Mario Sunshine</b><br>

<font size="1">2002 Nintendo</font>



<P>The worlds most popular plumber has landed himself smack-dab on Nintendos most recent console.  No longer is Nintendos system void of their biggest star.  Super Mario Sunshine tells of a vacation that Mario takes to Isle Delfino (which is coincidentally shaped like a dolphin as well).  When he arrives, he is accused of vandalizing the island surroundings with graffiti.



<p>Mario has a new gadget at his disposal this time around.  This device, which he wears on his back, acts as a jet-pack, water cannon, and more.  The key to the game is knowing how to use this tool, and how to manipulate your surroundings with it.  While cleaning up the island, Mairo is in hot pursuit of the man who framed him.  This mysterious man is essentially "water-Mario" since he is literally a version of Mario made of water.



<p>Like the previous outing Mario can collect over 100 shines (the main trophy of the game).  Each time he steps into a level you are taken to different "story" whereby the level changes slightly for a specific task.  New to this title is the addition of the blue coins.  By collecting enough of them, Mario can earn more shines.



<P>



<B>Features</B>

   <LI>Absolutely massive levels teeming with action

   <LI>Collect upwards of 100 "Shines"

   <LI>Supports both Progressive Scan and Dolby Pro Logic II

  </ul>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/10stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:otheranthony@n-sider.com">Anthony Pepera</a>: </b>Ok, Im not going to sit here and tell you how great, marvellous or spectacular <I>Super Mario Sunshine</I> is because youve been told that numerous other times through numerous other publications and still dont seem to get the point of it all (I presume thats why youre reading this). What I will tell you is that <I>Super Mario Sunshine</I> (despite Nintendos efforts to market it as a mass appeal game) is a game that throws the gamer in at the deep-end. No holding hands here junior.



<p>Starting at an airstrip after watching a surreal introductory FMV featuring Princess Peach, Mario and Toadsworth  Do you even use the same calendars as the rest of us Nintendo? An elderly Toad?  The crew are about to experience the true holiday from hell. The adventure starts as I said previously, on the airstrip you land (it is here that acts as the training area for the game) and spans across 7 differing tropical locals featuring the inhabitants of Isle Dolphino as NPCs.



<p>This time around youre trying to foil the dastardly plans of  a Mario look-a-like who has been running around in your visage painting the town in all sorts of sludge. Anyways, enough about the story. You didnt buy a Mario game for its story, you bought it for its unique gameplay right? Well as I said, Mario throws you in right at the deep-end without any remorse. Seasoned gamers, get a spoon ready because youre going to eat up every morsel of <I>Super Mario Sunshine</I>.



<p>Nintendo makes hopping, flipping and water-propelled hovering seems natural in this new world Mario has to explore. A large number of new moves have made it into the game, but not to worry, it all seems like second nature soon after you hit the beach. Wall-jumping between two pillars all the way to dizzy heights of Isle Delphino can be executed with relative ease and yet leave the gamer basking in their achievement while surveying the incredible draw distance from the various high points in the game. All this is made available to you from the very start in Delphino Plaza, where you get all the time you like to perfect your platforming skills.



<p>The flip side to having tight control over everything Mario can do are the tasks you are asked to achieve in the game. Mario is -and always has been- a game wrapped around the skills of Mario. If you see it, you can get to it. If you think it, you can do it. No more will this theory put you to the test than in the classic platforming world that youre warped to a number of times during your adventure. Your water pack is taken away from you leaving your skills out bare for the game to scrutinise at will (and scrutinise it will).



<p>Of course you have all the time in the world to complete the warp levels, but most times youll find yourself stationary, plotting a route across flipping platforms with spinning logs. Oh, thats right, I almost forgot to mention F.L.U.D.D. The water pack. The reason I forget is because it totally becomes part of Marios moves list and you really do miss the old fella when hes snatched away by that evil impostor. Yes, thats right, its a living uh thing. F.L.U.D.D gives you all the pointless advice that Nintendo knows you dont need but its in there for the kiddies. Great times. I mock F.L.U.D.D now, but the fact is Ill miss him if he isnt in the next Mario as his contribution in Mario Sunshine is invaluable.



<p>Jolly tunes bounce along out of your speakers in Stereo and PAL gamers are also treated to the delights of 60Hz-o-vision. The tunes in <I>Mario Sunshine</i> arent as memorable as the plinkety-plonk tunes of yesteryear but they still do a great job of setting the tropical scene. <I>Sunshine</i> in 60Hz clears up a little of the rough-edges leaving an impressive heat-haze effect, making everything easy on the eyes. Also notable is the water in <I>Mario Sunshine.</i> I could swear Nintendo poured some fresh mineral water in there Infact <I>Mario sunshine</i> is filled to the brim with as many magical moments as there were in <I>Super Mario 64.</i> Moments that youll really wonder how Nintendo was thinking in sync with what you were. Its then youll realise that no matter how many worlds, no matter how the game looks and no matter what review score anyone gives it, it deserves to be appreciated for what it is. A return to Marios roots. Its Platforming at it most challenging and at its best.



<p>Some may mumble under their breath about the camera but I say let them mumble. Because 99% of the time youll find that if you had adjusted the c-stick you would have made that crucial jump or hit that big ol target. At the end of the day its all about tough love. Nintendo love you, but they gotta treat ya dirty to keep you coming back for more. Thats exactly how every 2D <I>Super Mario</i> has been and thats how Super Mario Sunshine is. Other than that ladies and gents, this is a solid ten, but make no mistake, its easily one of the best games Nintendo have ever released.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/10stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:jburns@n-sider.com">James Burns</a>: </b>I think Im in love.  Really.  The last time I spent so many consecutive hours with a single game was probably when <I>Ocarina of Time</i> was released for the Nintendo 64.  Even on the GameCube, I have not yet experienced a game that has compelled me to just sit and play for hours on end.  Until now, that is.



<P>If you are aware of my writing on this site, you will know that the majority of my features have revolved around Mario.  Like many of you, I grew up on Mario.  And Mario was the single franchise that sucked me in to the world of Nintendo and refused to let me go.  Having read various reviews of <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> before its local Australian release, I was somewhat worried that this game might not fulfill my high expectations.  I had read about a horrible camera, poor quality FMV, shoddy voice acting and second-generation N64 graphics.  And now, at around 51 Shines in, I must definitely concur with Cory (review below).  Either game reviewers the world over have become horribly jaded in recent years, or people have become so obsessed with next generation graphics that they wouldnt know a truly good game if it landed in their lap.



<P><I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> is simply an absolute joy to play.  Theres no other way to describe it.  As soon as I saw the title screen and selected a game file, I knew that I was in for something special.  I just knew it.  Not only was I not disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised at how great this game turned out to be.  It doesnt matter how old you are or how much you love blowing up things with a rocket launcher; <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> will have you grinning from ear to ear.  This game just gets everything right.  Control of Mario himself is utterly flawless, level design is superb, objectives and challenges are unique and innovative and the learning curve is spot on.



<P>One thing I love about <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> is the camera.  If you dont own this game, then you have probably read countless criticisms of the games camera.  But for me personally, the decision to include a fully-controllable camera was a very wise move on Nintendos part.  Initially, I found that the camera was a problem because I half expected it to shift focus automatically.  It took me a little time to actually get into the habit of moving the camera constantly by myself.  But having played games like <I>Luigis Mansion</i> and <I>Pikmin,</i> I have become used to a two-stick setup.  The completely manual camera essentially eliminates one of the most frustrating elements of <I>Super Mario 64s</i> camera system. In <I>Super Mario 64,</i> the player was able to move the camera to a certain extent.  But in many situations, I found that Id move the camera to a desired spot only to have it slowly glide back to its original position.  And that became very frustrating.  In some areas I found myself fighting with the camera, wishing it would just stay put.  In <I>Super Mario Sunshine,</i> the problem is effectively eliminated.  Not only that, but the camera in this game feels much smoother than in <I>Super Mario 64.</i>  In <I>Super Mario 64,</i> you had to use digital buttons to shift the camera.  And by its very nature, you could only move the camera in several steps to the left, right or in and out.  In Marios latest adventure, you can move the camera exactly where you want it to be.  You can shift it out just a little, or all the way.  You dont have two or three set positions which for me, is a big plus.  And consequently, I find myself having very few if any camera troubles with <I>Super Mario Sunshine.</i>



<P>Visually, <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> is gorgeous.  Ive personally noticed one or two lower quality textures in the game, but to focus on these areas is to ignore the rest of the games beauty.  In particular, the textures on buildings seem to be very sharp and pretty.  I personally love the art style on the buildings; very fun and colorful, very Mario.  The use of color in this game is most welcome  I refuse to believe that anyone, no matter how jaded, can play this game without grinning.  The environments have a bright, organic feel to them.  And the entire world appears to be populated with countless creatures of various shapes and sizes.  When playing this game, you definitely feel as though you are wandering through a living world.  And yes, the water is the best Ive seen in any game so far.  Very pretty stuff.



<P>Interestingly, I had heard that the US and Japanese versions of Super Mario Sunshine do not include any indication of how many Blue Coins have been collected in each level, making it very difficult to know exactly where that least elusive Blue Coin can be found.  I notice, however, that the PAL version does indeed include a Blue Coin counter for each level.  So, it is definitely a most welcome addition for European and Australian gamers.



<P>At the end of the day, I could write forever about this game.  There are things I have not covered in my review, simply because you would likely have read them elsewhere a million times.  And if you own the game, you already know how great it truly is.  When all is said and done, <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> does not fail to impress.  This game is a very clear example of why Nintendo is the undisputed king of video games.  <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> is so much more than a mere platform game.  It is truly an adventure game.  The sheer variety and innovation present in many of the games objectives is unparalleled by any platformer thus far, in my opinion.  In what other game are you required to pull a giant squids lips, only to release them and have them slap him in the face?  <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> is full of these kinds of surprises.  At every turn, you will discover something new and unexpected.  And youll have an absolute blast doing so.   So, to end my light-headed ramble, Ill leave you with a very simple statement.  <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> is ultimately so much more than the sum of its parts  it is easily the best platform/adventure game in existence at the moment.  If you own a GameCube, there is simply no excuse not to own this brilliant title.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/9stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:mark@n-sider.com">Mark Medina</a>: </b>From the twirling windmill of Bianco Hills to the raging rollercoaster of Pinna Park, then the colourful surrounds of Noki Bay and the beautiful sunset of Sirena Beach, <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> dazzles and delights with its amazing locations, ingenious level design and perfect control system.



<P>As an interactive videogame experience, few can generate the level of enjoyment as a good Mario title, and its fitting that Sunshine is a worthy addition to this most prestigious of videogame series.



<P>Everything about the game is all class.  Top notch presentation, numerous nostalgic nods at previous Mario games, the (re)addition of Yoshi, tough puzzles, delightful meaningless additions, thoughtful music and sound effects, levels that will test your platforming skills to the max, new and interesting boss battles, and most importantly, its Mario that you get to control.  Its been six long years since Super Mario 64, and Nintendo has brought Mario into the 21st century to thrill and enchant us all.



<P>Forget about camera issues, position the camera to your hearts delight, and all your troubles will disappear.  Focus on the key aspects, and treasure <I>Super Mario Sunshine.</i>  As long as you dont go into it expecting revolutionary enhancements and gameplay, then you couldnt possibly be disappointed with the overall experience.  Its not perfect, theres plenty of room for improvement and innovation, but whats here is currently the finest game for the Gamecube, and quite possibly for all of the current-generation consoles.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/9stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:mark@n-sider.com">Will Stevenson</a>: </b>Who here remembers the feeling you got every time you discovered something cool in <I>Super Mario 64?</i>  Those charming little touches like Mario mumbling about pasta if you leave him to go to sleep, or how punching clusters of butterflies would sometimes result in a 1-up.  Personally speaking, it was these sorts of things that kept me within a metre radius of my controller for the entire fortnight that the game took to complete, and I'm pleased to say that if you identified with any of the above mentioned, <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> will have you smiling for a long time to come.



<P>What can I say?  The graphics, music and basic gameplay all are fantastic (can't get enough of that water!), and are pretty much what you've come to expect from Nintendo.  Its really the little details that make this game so special.  The birds flying around Isle Delfino, the underground pipe systems, the brilliant remix of the classic Mario tune (now more hum-able than ever) and countless other details.  I remember Miyamoto saying that with SMS he really wanted to create a "living, breathing world", and over the course of the game it really struck me just how well this ambition was realised.  I can't put my finger on it, but there is just a vibrancy that makes it come to life.  Overall, this feeling is largely responsible for the buzz of happiness that encompasses me every time I switch the game on.



<P>I feel necessary to point out that if you're expecting to be blown away like you were the first time you played <I>Super Mario 64,</i> you <B>WILL</b> be disappointed.  It seems that people were expecting Nintendo to pull another dimension from somewhere, which even the dimmest of us will admit to be somewhat unrealistic.  The way to look at <I>Super Mario Ssunshine</i> is as an incredible elevation of the game you love, an expansion on everything that made it great.  This is by far the best game available on the Gamecube thus far, and is a serious contender for Game of the Year.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/10stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:jason@n-sider.com">Jason Nuyens</a>:</b> Its not often that a game can completely monopolize a television set for actual days on end.  Family and friends have journeyed many miles to play a game, and all walk away smiling.  In these moments you can see the true brilliance that is <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>.  Its not how you, the master gamer can manipulate Mario to accomplish the task, but rather how the unskilled gamer can pick up this game and be guided into a fun learning process.



<p>The game is designed in such a way that you can learn at your own pace.  Beginner players can take their time, while expert players will meet their own respective challenges.  Knowing that I am somewhat of an expert when it comes to the Mario series of games, I thought I would breeze right through this game.  Boy was I wrong.  Not only did I get killed many times, but I was thrashed so hard I sometimes had to take a breather.  What a great feeling.  On the other side, with the beginners, they have the liberty to fool around in the games main hub area, and bounce around without a care in the world.  This is truly the definition of universal appeal.



<p>Lets get something straight though: <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> is a better game than <i>Mario 64</i>.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that Sunshine trounces it in every way imaginable.  The camera controls are perfect for lining yourself up just nicely.  The objectives are extremely varied, and are tailored to be fun in the most innocent ways.  The little details in this game make it a true Nintendo title.  Birds float effortlessly above, windmills slowly turn in the wind, and a ferris wheel can be seen revolving even five miles away on a distant island.  This is a Nintendo game in its purest form



<p>Is the game perfect?  Not exactly, yet I think overall it deserves no less than a 10.  The only thing that would make me even think of lowering the score is the one time where the game slowed down a bit. It happened for a couple minutes on one chapter, and never really happened again.  Now I know many will think but what about the camera? Doesnt it go crazy?  No.  If you know how to use your camera effectively, you wont have a problem.  In fact, the camera has gotten to a point where any changes would have people complaining anyway.  Use your C-Stick and L button often, and you should find yourself springing around without a hitch.  This game is definitely worth a 10.



<P><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/10stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:cory@n-sider.com">Cory Faller</a>:</b> Sometimes I want to kick in the faces of every reviewer on the planet.  People who decimate scores because of trivial issues, giving them equal or greater importance than the elements that <I>actually</I> make up a game.  People so jaded by the modern gaming industry that theyre physically and mentally incapable of <I>feeling</I> the greatness that ebbs through certain titles.  People so swamped in numbers, figures, and perceived expectations that they can barely pull their heads out of the muck for long enough to even PLAY a new game.



<P>Super Mario Sunshine is the best game on the GameCube.  Super Mario Sunshine is one of the finest games Nintendo has ever released.  Super Mario Sunshine deserves a 10.  And anyone who thinks otherwise has no right to call themselves a gamer.



<P>Now before you all jump down my throat, the way I see it, a 10 doesnt imply technical perfection.  NO game will EVER be perfect.  A game that receives a 10 gets it based solely on the feeling that it imbues the player with.  A feeling of entrancement that pulls the player into the world so fully that they never want to leave.  This is why games like Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time get 10s.  No matter what tiny little flaws they might have, they grab the player by the balls and hold on so tight that trying to pull away could result in mental castration.  Games that receive 10s might be better than each other in certain regards, but those differences are completely immaterial when it comes down to it.  Trying to decide which of Mario 64, Mario Sunshine, or Ocarina of Time is better is impossible.  Even thinking about it makes my brain hurt.



<P>So whats so great about Mario Sunshine anyways?  Well for one, I dont want it to end.  Ive got about 109 shines at the moment, and the prospect of it finally being over is all that keeps me from getting the last 11.  Mario Sunshine just makes me happy.  Running around in the hub when the sunshine has completely returned is as cathartic an experience as one can have.  And anyone who says that this game is less than visually stunning must be wearing contact lenses made of horse shit.  The number of things happening at once often times boggles the mind.  Dozens of birds, townsfolk, and enemies populate the worlds simultaneously, sporting colors more vibrant than youd think possible.  Complaints of low-poly environments and shoddy textures are unfounded at best.  Hell, the only less-than-perfect textures I found looked so uniformly pixilated that I swear they did it on purpose.  Bottom line - it doesnt matter.  A game can be absolutely gorgeous without being the most technically advanced thing in the world.  Its all a matter of presentation.



<P>The camera?  Pssh.  The freedom it allows you is the only way to successfully play a game like this.  The rare instances where it chokes up are just unavoidable.  Theres never been a perfect camera in a game, and I doubt there ever will.  But by leaving the control up to the player, Mario Sunshines camera comes pretty damn close.  Its just a matter of adjusting to the freedom.  The horrible cinema scenes?  Pfah.  I didnt ONCE see the SLIGHTEST trace of artifacting or distortion, leading me to believe that it might only happen when the game is put into progressive scan.  The cinemas as a whole were put into the game solely so they could do a couple things the game engine didnt allow for, like the water effects before the boss battle in Pinna Park and such.  People who complain that they dont look all that much better than the realtime segments seem to miss the point.  Its <I>supposed</I> to look contiguous.  Nintendo has never been a fan of disorienting the player by changing the graphical nature of an environment during cinemas.



<P>What it all comes down to is that Mario Sunshine is an absolutely fantastic game.  Theres such an incredibly large amount of stuff to do, and the heightened difficulty level only makes it that much more satisfying when you successfully complete an objective.  Its fun, its engaging, and its beautiful.  Mario Sunshine is to Mario 64 what Mario World was to Mario Brothers 3 - a wonderful evolution of an already solid concept.  Now go play it, before I come over there and MAKE you play it.
