<p>Shin'en confirmed to N-Sider that these shots are in-game, fully real-time 3D graphics.  The short premise for the game is as follows:

<p><i>You slowly come back to life in your spacecraft. It feels like you were unconscious only for seconds. Neverless you only have a vague idea of what has happenend. Frantic images loom in your mind without telling you anything you can decode by now. Slopped impressions of pain and humiliation cover your thoughts. Instinctively you look up to your console. Your board computer is still indicating a destination...</i>

<p>Shin'en told N-Sider to look forwards to more screenshots soon.
