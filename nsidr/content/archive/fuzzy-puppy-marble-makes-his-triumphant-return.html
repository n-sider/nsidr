One of my favorite early Wii titles was Hudson's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=1460&view=review">standard-setting</a> <i>Kororinpa: Marble Mania</i>.  Though its American box art left a bit to be desired and it had a few troublesome issues with graphical quality, its gameplay was simply compelling: tilt your Wii Remote to tilt the world and roll your marble to the end.<br />

Hudson announced today that come next spring, its successor will grace our shelves.  <i>Marble Saga: Kororinpa</i> will have a very palatable 150 levels (and the promise of more on the way after release via WiiConnect24) and add a number of sweet new features, such as an edit mode for making your own stages, online leaderboards, multiplayer for up to four people, and marble attribute customization.  They've also added a story involving some character named "Anthony the Ant", which I am personally hoping will not get in the way of the marble-rolling action or overshadow the overpowering cuteness of Fuzzy Puppy Marble in any way.<br />

On top of it all, you can optionally play <i>with the Wii Balance Board</i>.  How cool is that?
