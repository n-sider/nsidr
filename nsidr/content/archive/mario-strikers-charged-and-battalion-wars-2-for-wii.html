<p>Well, Nintendo's "Wii Prove our Promise" media conference has officially ended.  The speech was headlined by Nintendo Germany's General Manager Bernd Fakesch.  He spoke primarily about expanding audiences with the Nintendo DS.  Out of his speech come only a few new pieces of info.  The first is that a Pink version of the Nintendo DS Lite will release across Europe on October 27.</p>

<p>In addition, and perhaps a bit more exciting, comes confirmation that two new titles are in development for Wii -- <b>Battalion Wars 2</b> and <b>Mario Strikers Charged</b>.  Both are sequels to GameCube releases.  A video of Mario Strikers was shown that had players using the Wii remote to block goal kicks.  Meanwhile, we'll learn more details on Battalion Wars 2 since it will be playable on the conference show floor.</p>

Thanks again to everyone who braved the early hours of the morning to join us in the N-Forums chat room.</p>
