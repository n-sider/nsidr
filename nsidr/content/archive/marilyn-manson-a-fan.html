<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-01-03-marilyn.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="Marilyn Manson, fan of Nintendo DS">Marilyn Manson, the musician who celebrates Halloween 365 days of the year, says he recently bought a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>.  "Yeah, I bought a Nintendo DS a couple of weeks ago. That things pretty neat," he <a href="http://boards.gamefaqs.com/gfaqs/genmessage.php?board=985&topic=25472371">said</a> in an interview on E! entertainment television channel.</p>

<p>Mr. Manson is not without games for his dual-screen handheld.  When asked what games he owned he responded, "Oh, uh, I'm pretty good at Mario Kart. My friend got me this little Japanese lawyer game. It's $%#@ amazing."  We assume he refers to the $%#@ amazing and difficult to find Capcom title <i>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</i>.  He's got good taste.</p>
