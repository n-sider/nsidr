<b>Golden Sun</b><br>

<font size="1"> 2001 Nintendo / Camelot Software Planning</font>



<p>Many of us joke around about our grandparents and how they used to precede every sentence with when I was a kid  or  back in the day  When it comes to gamers we can become very sentimental about the forefathers of todays high-tech games.  In particular, there always seems to be a strong attachment to role playing games of old.  Many people will testify that their favorite gaming moments were spent with their RPG of choice.  Once the SNES fell by the wayside however, we saw a slowdown (and segregation) of the RPG genre.  Instead of just having a rich and engaging storyline, RPGs were pushed as graphical behemoths as well.



<p>Golden Sun is certainly a step back into the time machine.  This is one of those special moments in many peoples lives where they can see a continuation (and mastering) of an age old tradition.  The game was developed by Camelot Software Planning; the same team that brought Shining Force to the table and other N64 developments such as the Mario sports series. Nintendo and Camelot's <i>Golden Sun</i> is not only a new RPG being introduced, but one Nintendo is pushing as a series with future installments to come.



<p><b>Features</b>

<ul>

<li>Epic storyline

<li>A rich visual package

<li>Pseudo-orchestrated score

<li>Battery save

<li>Link cable support for two-player battles

<li>Only for GameBoy Advance

  </ul>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/9stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Jason:</b> It's a great fealing when you get to play a game that indefinitely has the "Nintendo" touch. This title certainly has alot to be happy about. If you skipped getting your GBA for Advance wars then I understand, it's only one game. If you skip getting a GBA now though you are missing out on one heck of a library. Golden Sun is easily one of the greatest games I have ever had the chance to play, and for good reason.



<p>The game's graphics are, of course, immaculate. I couldn't believe the first time I saw lightning effects on the terrain that already looks great. As the story unfolds you find yourself getting more and more attached to your characters. Not only that but Camelot has taken an approach that I find very pleasing. They give ample time for you to get used to your character instead of ushering new characters all the time. Other RPG's do that and it had the feeling of "Oh, yeah, another character..." Not Golden Sun though, it stands out amongst the competition whether it be new or old.



<p>I can't give this game a perfect review because of one or two nitpicky things. First is the sometimes annoying sounds in the game. They aren't bad half the time but sometimes feel out of place. Music is perfect though. A definite must buy!



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/9stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Anthony:</b> Golden Sun is one of the most charming role playing games I've played since the 16-bit era. While the turn-based battles are standard fare and more of a correction of the flawed <i>Beyond the Beyond</i>, it's generally fast and the summons are quite a sight. The storyline is interesting but standard fare, similar to the usual overly cliched or cutesy role playing games brought over from Japan. one area the game does stand out in is its wonderful soundtrack and awespiring visuals intact.



<p>The game is incredibly addicting, and has the production value that will give classics such as <i>Chrono Trigger</i> and <i>The Secret of Mana</i> a run for their money. Just an incredible RPG title that is a must buy for any remote fan of the genre who happens to own a Game Boy Advance. Kudos to Nintendo for keeping a steady flow of solid RPGs on the Game Boy Advance.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/10stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Brenden:</b> A game where the protagonist is 17 years old and has more angst in him than a Slipknot album... yep, sounds like an RPG to me. I'm not going to blow the plot open too much, but let's just say something terrible happens, at the beginning of the game, that persuades you into learning the powers of Psynergy (magic). As many of you know, a great storyline is typically the backbone of any respectable RPG. Golden Sun definitely does not flounder in this department. The story is slightly clich at times, but it's executed well. Enjoyable little quirks are thrown in everywhere to lighten the mood if necessary, and there are enough little twists to keep you interested.



<p>The gameplay is excellent. The puzzles are fun and challenging, and the ability to save anywhere in a dungeon is an added bonus. The battle sequences are simply beautiful. Actually, the entire is game is simply beautiful. Everything is crisp, clean and detailed. I guess there are a couple instances during battles where things don't look perfect, but you'll never notice or care, trust me. Moving onto the audio, where do I start? It's amazing, perfect even. Not since Revelations have I heard music this good on a handheld. Actually, it's been awhile since I've heard music this good in a game, period. It ranks right up there with soundtracks from the likes of <i>Xenogears</i> and <i>Jet Force Gemini</i>. To be honest, when I first started the game, I was ticked right off at the voice bleeps. It was getting really annoying, but then I found that you could shut the voice sound effects off in the settings. So, no complaints from me on that one.



<p>This game is easily one of the best, if not the best RPG game I've played this year. There's no reason in my mind why this game doesn't deserve a 10 and I highly recommend buying it, whether you currently own a GBA or not.
