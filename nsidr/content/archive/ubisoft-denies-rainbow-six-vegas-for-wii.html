<p>Ubisoft has responded to recent rumors that penned a version of <a href="http://rainbowsixgame.us.ubi.com/vegas/agegate.php?destURL=/vegas/index.php">Rainbow Six: Vegas</a> is under development for Wii.  "Rainbow Six Vegas has been announced and is currently being developed for the Xbox 360 and Sony PS3 platforms and is not in development for any other consoles at this time," a spokesperson informed IGN.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Vegas is currently under development at Ubisoft's Montreal studio.  Only Ubisoft's Paris studio has announced development of Wii titles. These include Rayman Raving Rabbids and Red Steel, both of which are scheduled to launch alongside the Wii later this year.</p>
