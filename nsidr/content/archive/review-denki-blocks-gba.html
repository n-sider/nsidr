<H3>Denki Blocks</H3>



<i>Denki Blocks</i> is Majesco's latest GBA title and is also one of the more unique puzzle games on the system.  The game is based on the concept of matching similarly-colored blocks in order to form shapes.  However, unlike games such as <i>Tetris</i>, the blocks actually sit on a kind of chessboard.  Additionally, <i>Denki Blocks</i> is paced somewhat like an adventure game (in the sense that you actually encounter different characters whom you must defeat).  And with the addition of several different play styles, <i>Denki Blocks</i> manages to stand out amongst games of its genre.<p>



<b>Features</b>

<ul>

<li>270 unique puzzles in Tournament Mode

<li>Four player compatible, with three different Versus games

<li>Three single player modes including Tournament, Workout and Perfecto!</ul><p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/7stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:jburns@n-sider.com">James Burns</a>:</b> <i>Denki Blocks</i> is a little difficult to describe.  So please try to bare with me...<p>



As mentioned above, the primary goal of <i>Denki Blocks</i> is to move various colored blocks around a chessboard-like square.  The idea is to fit the like-colored pieces together.  Initially, this is all you will need to do; you won't necessarily need to actually make a shape.  Rather, the goal will simply be to put the like-colored pieces together.  This sounds simple, but even in some early levels, it proves to be quite a challenge.<p>



There are three different types of colored blocks; red, blue and yellow.  As an example, you might start with a square that contains two yellow blocks and two blue blocks.  Like <i>Tetris</i>, the blocks are not all square.  Sometimes they will take up two spaces horizontally and one vertically.  Often, you'll find that each "block" is a different shape.  However, on just about every level you will also find white blocks.  White blocks are always stationery; they cannot be moved by the player.  So, if you are pressing the directional pad to the right, every colored block will slide to the right on the chessboard.  But if one colored block has a white block infront of it, it will hit the white block and will not continue moving.  The white blocks essentially act like brick walls in order to stop the movement of blocks that hit them.  This concept is both positive and negative; in some levels you'll only have a couple of white blocks on the board.  In those cases (particularly if you are trying to make a shape), you can use the white blocks to arrange your colored blocks in the desired shape.  But sometimes there are a series of white blocks (occasionally forming "tunnels" and pathways), which are deliberately designed to make you work harder.  In these situations (and since every colored block moves when you press the directional pad), the key is to figure out the correct movement sequence in order to create a particular shape (even just joining your blocks together can be difficult).<p>



So once again, let's say you have a series of yellow blocks and a series of blue blocks.  You might find that you easily link all the yellow blocks together first.  Once this is done, the shape you make will fade and become "stuck".  Essentially, it will behave just like the white blocks.  This adds yet another dimension to gameplay; if you create your yellow shape first, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally block your blue blocks from joining together.  For the most part, if you're careful, it's not too much of a problem.  The game has a "back" feature, which allows you to undo your previous step (though the amount of times you can undo a move is finite).  In some cases though, particularly on more difficult levels, I found myself restarting the entire level because I had run out of undo options.<p>



<i>Denki Blocks</i> presents itself almost like an adventure game.  Once you choose a file (and choose a male or female character), you travel to Puzzle Island and go up against multiple characters in an effort to become the Puzzle Master.  When you select a new enemy, you'll be greeted with a short animated sequence that will introduce you to the character.  Of course, this is only filler; the real stuff starts when you reach a kind of checkerboard menu.  The checkerboard menu contains a grid with cards all over it.  Each card represents a particular puzzle.  Once you have completed a puzzle, the card will be lifted from the grid.  For the most part, you don't actually need to complete every single puzzle on the grid in order to move to the next level.  You only need to complete about 15 puzzles (out of around 25-30).  However, should you complete every puzzle, another row will open up underneath that includes several high-difficulty puzzles.<p>



The great thing about <i>Denki Blocks</i> is that it is truly a game that anyone can enjoy.  If you're a slow learner or not used to puzzle games, you'll find that the game gently eases you into the Tournament mode (by way of a very well produced Tutorial mode).  Additionally, as mentioned, you don't <i>need</i> to complete every single puzzle on every level in order to move on.  But for those who are more highly skilled, <i>Denki Blocks</i> provides ample opportunity to challenge yourself and to beat your own record.<p>



Visually, <i>Denki Blocks</i> does the job.  It is by no means the most technically advanced GBA title on the market, but for a puzzle game, <i>Denki Blocks</i> seems to make a strong effort to look colorful and varied.  The small cut scenes in the game, whilst not overly impressive or particularly useful, are a nice diversion and add to the overall "adventure game feel" of the title.  <p>



In the sound department, <i>Denki Blocks</I> is satisfactory.  Once again, there is nothing particularly remarkable about the game's sound.  But having said that, you'll often find yourself humming some of the game's catchy tunes.  And though puzzles games don't offer much opportunity for detailed sound effects, the "bloop" sound of blocks joining together is appropriate and only adds to the game's overall personality.<P>



Overall, I am generally not a puzzle game player myself.  I have enjoyed a few puzzle titles over the years, but I'm certainly not someone who goes looking for the genre when I purchase a new game.  However, I find myself spending quite a lot of time with <i>Denki Blocks</i>.  There are so many obvious <i>Tetris</i> rip-offs out there.  And though this game does bare some minor similarities, it certainly stands amongst other puzzle greats on its own merits.  Ultimately, <i>Denki Blocks</i> is a unique, expansive and rewarding puzzle game.  If you are a fan of puzzlers, you should definitely look into this title.  And if not, I think it's still worth your consideration.<p>
