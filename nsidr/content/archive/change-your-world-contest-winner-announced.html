Nintendo of America said that Tony Solary, a 24-year-old graphic designer and Nintendo fan, has won first place in the Game Boy Advance SP "Change Your World" design contest. The Change Your World contest was based on the series of television and print Game Boy Advance SP ads that highlighted the ability of the system to "transform players' environments by immersing them into fun games and rich storylines". As a prize, Solary will receive a Game Boy Advance SP handheld and video game and his design will be published in the October issue of Nintendo Power magazine.  You can get a sneak peak at his design <a href="http://poster.gameboy.com/">here</a>.
