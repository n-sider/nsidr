Not content with making yet another touch screen game, Nintendo decided it was time to create an entirely new control scheme for the DS. Enter the slide controller. Plug it into the GBA slot, place the DS on a flat surface, and the controller picks up sliding movement.<br />
<br />
IGN's <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/794/794548p1.html">translation of the latest Famitsu</a> has a preview with more details. The peripheral will be packed in with a brand new Nintendo IP: <i>Slide Adventure: Mag Kid</i>.  Mag Kid has magnetic powers that allow him to pick up various objects in order to solve puzzles.<br />
<br />
Mag Kid isn't completely passive, though. By quickly sliding Mag Kid in the direction of an enemy, he can paralyze the enemy. Paralyzed enemies can be picked and their powers used, such as breathing fire or shooting lazers. Multiple enemies can be picked up at once, and some levels will even require them to be picked up in a certain order.<br />
<br />
One example scenario pits Mag Kid against a fire boss, the Four Flame Brothers. Using his powers, Mag Kid must pick up water droplets and toss them into the four fires.<br />
<br />
Mag Kid will be sliding his way to the DS in Japan on August 2, 2007.
