<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3541-1.jpg" width="200" height="150" class="image_styled" /></div>Wired's Chris Kohler has been to Nintendo's new offices in Redwood Shores&#8212;called the "San Francisco office" despite it being an hour's drive from SF&#8212;and has gathered a number of pictures of the classy offices, which don't seem to have much in the way of ties to Nintendo's past on exhibit.<br />

<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Chris Kohler, Wired</span>...it seems like the decor here will be more elegant. More reflective of the "new Nintendo," the one for adults and important people in suits? Maybe.</div></div><br />
