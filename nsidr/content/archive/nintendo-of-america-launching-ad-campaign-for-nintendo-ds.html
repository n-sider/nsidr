<p>Nintendo of America has announced the launch of its "Touching is good" campaign to prepare gamers for the Nintendo DS release on November 21.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><center><font size="2">"The campaign for Nintendo DS marks a different, bolder approach for Nintendo," says George Harrison, Nintendo of America's senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications. "We think such a radically different and creative device like Nintendo DS deserves the backing of an equally innovative and provocative marketing campaign."</font></center></p>

<p>The "Touching is good" campaign will show consumers and describe to them the unique features - such as built-in mic, dual-screen, and touch screen -- of the Nintendo DS. Three pre-launch television ads begin airing on Oct. 25. Nintendo has partnered with MTV to produce an ad with the stars of the Wildboyz show.  In addition, advertisements will run in various magazines including Maxim, Blender and Stuff.  The theme in the magazines tells readers "How to Score." 

<p>In December, Nintendo will run ads on more than 5,000 movie screens across the country. Print and Internet ads will follow. </p>

<p>Several titles will be ready for or shortly after the Nintendo DS launch including: Super Mario 64 DS, Madden NFL 2005, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2005, The Urbz: Sims in the City, Spider-Man 2, Ping Pals, Feel the Magic: XY/XX, Rayman DS, Asphalt Urban GT, Ridge Racer DS, and Mr. DRILLER: Drill Spirits.  The Nintendo DS will retail for $149.99.</p>
