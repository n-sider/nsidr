More info can be found at the game's official <a href="http://www.2ksports.com/games/mlb2k6/">website</a>.</p>

<p>This is the only major league baseball game available for consoles after Take Two's acquisition of the license in 2005.  Major League Baseball 2K6 contains the traditional baseball gameplay with a few new features.</p>

"MLB 2K6 is a game of nice touches, but it's still only a three-tool player. You'll love gripping and ripping with the Swing Stick, and the new pitching system is enjoyable thanks to pressure situations and payoff pitches. Inside Edge is the most significant addition to the game, and we hope to see scouting play a part in the genre in the future. But control problems with base-running and fielding, along with a lack of general polish, keep 2K6 from being the great game it's trying to be. It's a smart game off the field with the Inside Edge and intelligent franchise mode but, in the end, MLB 2K6 is a decent baseball title and a strong base to move forward with the MLB license."

"As a game, MLB 2K6 feels more than competent, but it fails to excel. Much like last year's Cubs, it has its shining moments, but in the end you're left with the distinct feeling that it could have been so much more."

Nintendo says (6.5/10),<br>
"There's much room for improvement here.  And not just in the small things.  Upping the quality of the overall presentation would go a long way toward making MLB 2K6 a better game.  It may not be the greatest game ever, but its attention to the intricacies of the sport should satisfy both baseball fans and gamers alike.  Plus, it is the only baseball sim scheduled to hit the GCN anytime soon, so we'll have to make do."
