<p>Just a little GDC media for you folks that has come across NOA's PR wires.  First off, we've got Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-03-24-official_keynote.pdf">official PDF of the keynote address</a> Iwata delivered yesterday.  This is <em>the</em> definitive copy.</p>

<p>We've also got a handful of photos from the keynote, so you can close your eyes and pretend you were there on that fateful day when Iwata set the record straight about Pepsi.</p>
