The rumors are true, according to Redmond's deputy city planner Jim Roberts: Nintendo of America does plan to move some of its workforce out of the city and into new locations in New York and San Francisco.<br />
<br />
Numerous reports appearing in Seattle-based news outlets such as <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003699107_nintendo09.html"><i>The Seattle Times</i></a> and the <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/314884_nintendo09.html"><i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i></a> are talking about Roberts' confirmation of the move.  Affected NOA employees&mdash;those in sales, marketing, and advertising&mdash;learned of the plans May 3 and have been given until June 1 to decide whether to move.<br />
<br />
The move came as a bit of a surprise to the city, who <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1657">had been expecting Nintendo to expand</a> for well over a year.  Redmond Mayor Rosemarie Ives told the Seattle Times that Nintendo intends to replace the positions lost in Redmond, though they were not saying what the new hires would do.
