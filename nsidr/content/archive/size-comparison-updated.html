<p>Sure, you've probably pondered the technical comparisons of the next-generation systems.  Which will have better graphics?  Which will inevitably give me head lice?  But have you wondered how the next-generation systems are compared size-wise, right on down to the centimeters...  (insert obligatory sexual innuendo here)  Well, we've come across an image that does a decent enough job at sizing the systems up.</p>

<p>Mr. Xbox might want to consider going on the Atkins.  Thanks to MAGUS from the Nintendo <a href="http://forums.nintendo.com/nintendo/board/message?board.id=revolution&message.id=692679&view=by_date_ascending&page=1">forums</a> for creating the image and thanks to TheKoopaBros for pointing this fact out to us.</p>

<p>In addition, Andre Segers sent us an image that portrays the size of the Revolution a bit more accurately than the above image.  Take a look at that <a href="http://www.advancegb.com/upload/revolution.jpg">here</a>.</p>
