A survey conducted for Nintendo by Harris Interactive, done to gauge the desire for the DS Lite and titles such as <i>Brain Age</i>, has come back with results that Nintendo believes may spell good news for the company's push to expand their market beyond traditional video game consumers.<br />
<br />
Harris found that 34% of baby boomers and 27% of grandparents expressed an interest in getting a portable video game system for the holiday gift-giving season.  Nintendo believes that the Nintendo DS and Touch Generations titles such as Brain Age fit that criteria, having recently <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2499">showed the aforementioned off</a> at the AARP's Life@50+ event.  (You might want to think twice before getting Grandma Touch Generations title <i>Elite Beat Agents</i>, though.)<br />
<br />
Additionally, the survey found 68% of boomers and 52% of grandparents simply wanted some form of technology product.  How many get one remains to be seen, but Nintendo hopes DS figures prominently.
