<p>Over the wires this morning comes the news that Atlus U.S.A. will publish Marvelous Interactive's <i>Contact</i> in the United States this summer.</p>

<p><i>Contact</i> is a unique RPG being produced by <i>Killer 7</i> producer/director Suda 51, where a professor crash-lands on an alien planet and enlists the assistance of a local boy named Terry &mdash; played by you &mdash; to escape. The professor lives on one screen while Terry plays out the game on the other.</p>

<p>The game features real-time combat, extensive use of dual-screen functionality, and will also make use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Character design for the game is being handled by Atsuko Fukushima of PlayStation Portable <i>PoPoLoCrois</i> fame.</p>

<p><i>Contact</i> doesn't yet have a solid date beyond "Summer 2006", but we'll let you know when we hear more.</p>
