Jason Hughes (formerly a senior graphics tool engineer with Naughty Dog) and Andrew Gilmour (formerly a senior background artist with same) have formed a new studio in Austin, Texas and have announced their intent to create titles for WiiWare.<br />
<br />
The pair have been working for the past year to create a proprietary engine built specifically for Wii, as well as a new IP intended to span a series of games. "I am impressed with the egalitarian approach Nintendo has taken toward WiiWare developers," Hughes said. "It allows the risk burden to shift back onto the creative developers."
