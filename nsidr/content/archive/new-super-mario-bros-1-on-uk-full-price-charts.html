<p>Recently debuted <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876">New Super Mario Bros.</a></cite> has hit the UK charts running, taking the top spot among that country's <a href="http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c="https://static.nsidr.com/p/software/uk/latest/index_test.js"p&ct=110016">full-price software chart</a> according to sales tracking outfit Chart Track.  However, Mario's success wasn't exactly a clean sweep.  If you take a look at <a href="http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c="https://static.nsidr.com/p/software/uk/latest/index_test.js"p&ct=110015">the charts including budget-priced software</a>, you'll see that the title lags behind the PlayStation Portable's <cite>Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories</cite>.</p>

<p>New Super Mario has been doing exceptionally well in Japan since its release, going over 1.2 million in a month.  Stateside, Nintendo announced  late last month that the title had <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2244">managed 500k sales</a>.</p>
