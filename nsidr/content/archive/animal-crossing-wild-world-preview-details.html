<p>IGN and GameSpot have both posted previews from their hands-ons with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a>, and from these new details have emerged.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fossils that you find in your town, previously jammed inexplicably into an envelope and mailed to a faraway museum for identification, can now be given directly to Blathers the owl.  He has apparently studied up on this sort of thing and is now qualified to identify them himself, accepting them immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>If town residents are having a little tiff, previously you only got to stand aside and watch.  Now, if you're within cuffing distance, you may get dragged into their argument.  The lesson: stay clear of kangaroos with evil red eyes.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, an answer to the question everyone looking forward to the game has been asking: will we be able to kick troublemakers out of our towns?  The answer, praise be to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=17">Eguchi</a>, is a resounding <i>yes</i>.</p></li>
  </ul>
