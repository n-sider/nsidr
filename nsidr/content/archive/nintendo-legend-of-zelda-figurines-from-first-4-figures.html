<p>First 4 Figures acquired a three-year licensing agreement with Nintendo to create statues based on The Legend of Zelda franchise.  The company plans to release single statues, mixed media statues, and VS dioramas that will range in the prices of $80 to $200.  The figurines will be on display at the E3 Expo in May and available for sale at specialty retailers or on the First 4 Figures website sometime between July and September of this year.</p>
