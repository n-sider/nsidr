<p>If you have the sinking feeling that your Nintendo DS or Nintendo GameCube lack style, GameStop is offering some skins to help brighten your day.  <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=802209">DS Pink Fur Skin</a> might go well with your copy of Nintendogs.  "No way," you say?  Well, you're a hard one to please.  How about the fashionable <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=802210">GameCube Sonic Riders Skin</a>?  On a more serious note, both of these products were created by Gamer Graffix and are available for $9.99.  If these two particular skins don't suit your taste, you might have some better luck at their official <a href="http://www.gamergraffix.com/">website</a>.</p>
