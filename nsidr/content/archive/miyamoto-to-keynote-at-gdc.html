Hot on the heels of our story about Aonuma and Kondo <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2595">doing lectures at the upcoming Game Developers Conference</a> comes the news that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> himself will be presenting a keynote.<br />
<br />
The talk, entitled "A Creative Vision", will see Miyamoto revealing "how a singular creative vision drives his work, not only in terms of his world-renowned software like the Super Mario Bros. and Legend of Zelda series, but also in generating key technologies, including the current global phenomena, Nintendo DS and Wii."<br />
<br />
Jamil Moledina, executive director of the GDC, pitched the keynote thusly: "The Game Developers Conference is a place for developers to learn from one another, and I think it is safe to say that every member of the community has at one time or another fantasized about having Shigeru Miyamoto as a mentor and teacher.  By guiding us through his creative vision with a keynote at this year's GDC, Miyamoto is allowing all attendees this incomparable privilege."<br />
<br />
The Game Developers Conference runs from March 5 through 9 at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco.
