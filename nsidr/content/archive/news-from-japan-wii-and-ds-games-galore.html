This week's big news comes from the Japanese gaming magazine <i>Famitsu</i>, and third parties are announcing new Wii and DS games like there's no tomorrow. Keep in mind that none of the following games have yet been announced for a release outside of Japan.<br />
<br />
On the Wii front, there are three new game announcements this week. Perhaps the most exciting news is the new game from Vanillaware, <i>Oboro Muramasa Y&#333;t&#333;den</i>. Vanillaware is responsible for the stunningly beautiful Playstation 2 side-scrolling action RPG, <i>Odin Sphere</i>, and their new game appears to have a <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-5.jpg">similar</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-6.jpg">art style</a>, with added Wii remote controls for attacks.<br />
<br />
Next on the list is <i>Shikigami no Shiro 3</i>, the sequel to the Gamecube shoot 'em up <i>Castle Shikigami 2</i>. It has been announced for both the Xbox 360 and Wii, and will be released in Japan on December 13.<br />
<br />
The last Wii game announced this week is <i>Fuurai no Shiren 3: Karakuri Yashiki no Nemuri Hime</i>, or Shiren the Wanderer 3. It is part of the long-running Mysterious Dungeon series in Japan, which includes the upcoming <i>Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon</i>. Shiren the Wanderer 3 will follow its predecessors in the hack 'n' slash genre, as players <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-1.jpg">control</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-2.jpg">Shiren</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-3.jpg">across</a> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-4.jpg">30 dungeons</a>. No release date has been announced, but it's expected sometime next year.<br />
<br />
Not to be outdone, the DS is also receiving three new games. The first is a puzzle game from Square-Enix. <i>Yosumin DS</i> is a <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-8.jpg">remake</a> of a popular <a href="http://bp.gameonblog.com/jparts/game_color.html?game.swf?myMode=1&myUrl="https://static.nsidr.com/yosumin.swf"&myWidth=640&myHeight=480">flash game</a> in Japan. It will include a multiplayer versus mode and is set for release this November in Japan.<br />
<br />
The second DS game is <i>Sakura Taisen: Kimi Arugatame</i>, to be released in 2008. Sakura Taisen, or Sakura Wars, is a popular series in Japan that combines two genres into one. Half the time is a dating sim, and the other half is a dungeon-crawler. This particular <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3032-7.jpg">entry</a> will not break from that formula except that it will likely utilize the touch screen in some fashion.<br />
<br />
The last isn't so much a game as it is an encyclopedia. <i>Sunrise Anime Tsuki DS</i> contains text, images, movies, and sound clips from many of Sunrise's different anime series, including Gundam, Cowboy Bebop, King Gazer, and more. Also included are knowledge tests about the anime. It will hit Japanese shelves in November.<br />
<br />
Once again, none of these have been announced for release anywhere except Japan, and it is likely some of them will never be localized. Thanks go to <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=187279">Jonnyram of NeoGAF</a> for the translations.
