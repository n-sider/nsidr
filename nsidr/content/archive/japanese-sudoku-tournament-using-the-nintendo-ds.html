<p>Word from Japan and Famitsu, via a translation by N-Sider reader Samer, arrives news that the first Sudoku tournament was held where players competed using the Nintendo DS video game "Puzzle Series Vol.3 SUDOKU."  The tournament was hosted in Akihabara, Tokyo, by Hudson, the game's developer and Nikori, a well-known puzzle magazine.  Over a hundred people participated in several stages of the contest.  The nomination stage lasted for an entire 45 minutes after which only the 10 highest scoring contestants qualified to move on.  The finals were an additional 30 minutes of nail-biting before finally arriving with the top three scoring contestants.  The winners each took home various prizes including a Nintendo DS Lite.</p>
