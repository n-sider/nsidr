<p>Sega has announced that it will bring <i>Super Monkey Ball Touch & Roll</i> to the Nintendo DS in North America and Europe come March 2006.</p>

<p>The single-player portion of the game will feature 10 worlds and 50 brand-new stages.  You'll be able to roll your monkey around using either the touch screen or the directional pad.</p>

<p>Party Mode features six games playable in both single and multiplayer modes.  Monkey Race, Monkey Fight, Monkey Mini Golf, and Monkey Bowling are all making returns, and new to this title are Monkey Hockey and Monkey Wars.</p>

<p>The game sports an all-new art style unique to the series, but it remains to be seen just how much Sega plans on making the series fresh and new with this title.  Given the reappearance of a lot of levels from the original two titles, the prospects don't look so good at the moment.</p>
