<p>This is certainly no news to those of us who crammed into <a "href=http://forums.n-sider.com/chat/">the N-Forums chat</a> on that fateful night, but <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/poll/index.html?poll=2239">GameFAQs' "what will you remember most" 2005 poll</a> has the unveiling of the Nintendo Revolution "freestyle" controller in second place with 20%, edging out all other actual news events.</p>

<p>The only moment beating out the unveiling is "just playing great games and having fun"  which, when it comes down to it, is all that's really important in the end anyway, isn't it?  With luck, and with Revolution's 2006 arrival, we'll be even more into this in the coming year.</p>
