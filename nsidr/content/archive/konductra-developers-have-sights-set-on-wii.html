<p>Having recently secured a publisher for upcoming Wi-Fi-Connection-compatible Nintendo DS puzzler <cite>Konductra</cite>, developer oeFun said in <a href="http://www.gwn.com/articles/article.php/id/743">a recent interview</a> with Gameworld Network their next project will be for Nintendo's upcoming Wii home console.</p>

<p>"oeFun is all about making fun games, so we are certainly going to continue that," explained the interviewee, unnamed (perhaps founder and developer Ian Dunlop?).  "I can tell you that the plan is to make a Wii game next."</p>
