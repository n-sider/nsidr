<p>Just an update for those who are a bit worried after noticing that there hasn't been a new news story in a month and a half.  We're all still alive, and the news will be returning with a vengence.</p>

<p>You see, we're completely overhauling the database that powers the backend of the site.  If you make note of the new <a href="news.php">news</a>, <a href="articles.php">article</a>, <a href="columns.php">column</a>, and <a href="games.php">game</a> indexes, you'll see some of the fruits of these labors.  Unfortunately, this invalidates the backend tools we've been using for the last year.  New ones are being constructed and implemented, but until that's finished all site updates have to be made manually.  And instead of having to deal with all that tomfoolery, we just decided to give the news a bit of a vacation.</p>

<p>But you don't care about all that.  When will the news return, you ask?  How about right now!  Our E3 coverage will mark the return of the regular news updates you know and love.</p>

<p>So fret not!  Everything has returned to working order, and the world can resume turning.</p>
