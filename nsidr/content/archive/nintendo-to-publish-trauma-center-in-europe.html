<p>Nintendo of Europe has <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/press_release.php?aid=13025">announced it will publish</a> Atlus's <i>Trauma Center: Under the Knife</i> for Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>The well-reviewed (<a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/922120.asp">82% at GameRankings</a> based on 32 reviews) and unique surgery-simulation game has you playing doctor as a mysterious outbreak sweeps the emergency room, taking your direction from a nurse in apparent need of a higher-fiber diet.  Players use the stylus to make incisions, apply various surgical gels, and all kinds of other doctor-related sorts of things.</p>

<p>Nintendo intends to bring the title, which according to Atlus is in the top three US Nintendo DS titles, to European gamers in March 2006.</p>
