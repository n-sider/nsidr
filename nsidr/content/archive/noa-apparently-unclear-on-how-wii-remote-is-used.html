<i>Wii Fit</i> made its debut on mainstream TV today with appearances on <i>Good Morning America</i>, and Nintendo has set an MSRP of about $90 for the game and Balance Board, which is pretty much in-line with expectations.  But the real news is that apparently some marketeers at Nintendo of America don't seem to understand how you use the Wii Remote.<br />
<br />

The "Touch Generations" branding was previously restricted to Nintendo DS titles that were supposed to be easy to get into by all ages.  Its logo incorporated the DS stylus, naturally.  This mutant logo, featuring a Wii Remote doing something nobody has ever made it do&#8212;draw on a flat surface&#8212;appears on the newly-unveiled Wii Fit box.  While titles from the Wii franchise certainly embody that same spirit (though I'm still scratching my head over how <i>Elite Beat Agents</i> got stuck with the Touch Gen emblem), this juxtaposition simply strikes me as bizarre.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it would have been better to simply stick with the "Wii" moniker?  Its mindshare is, after all, more of a phenomenon than Touch Gen ever managed in the States.
