<p>The 2004 DICE Summit and 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards were held today March 4, and continue tomorrow March 5, in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>

<p>During a roundtable today, several executives from Electronic Arts, Ubi Soft, THQ, and Nintendo spoke on various industry related issues.  Online gaming was one particular subject addressed by each company.  Although Electronic Arts, Ubi Soft and THQ all have online games in development, Nintendo was less forthcoming.</p>

<p>According to IGN, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a>, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of corporate affairs, commented on online gaming and what it means to Nintendo.</p>

<p>"I think from where we stand it looks to us that it's going to be fairly niche for a long time," said <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Kaplan</a>. "I think some of our interests instead lie in building community on the wireless play front as opposed to the online one."</p>

<p>Nintendo's online history is a tumultuous one.  Take a look at N-Sider's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendonline">NintendOnline</a> write-up to learn more.</p>
