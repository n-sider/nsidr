<p><ul>
<li>Killer robots are attacking major cities across the United States, and the military is
powerless to stop them. Players control one of Project H.A.M.M.E.R.'s cyborg
prototypes: half-man, half-machine, with an extraordinary weapon - and the power to
save the world.
<li>Grab the Wii Remote and start swinging. Equipped with a hammer of amazing
strength, players represent the only hope against an unstoppable army of
marauding automatons.
<li>Players use the Nunchuk controller in one hand to maneuver through a variety of
vast and detailed environments. They use the Wii Remote in the other just like a
real hammer to control the hero's weapon. Swing the controller side to side to
make the in-game hammer send enemies flying. Lift it into the air and bring it
down to smash robots to smithereens. Use the A button for quick hammer flurries.
<li>Enter a world of nonstop action, excitement and relentless destruction. Players
will reduce rampaging robots to scrap metal as they battle their way across the
United States. If they see an enemy, they smash it. And they continue to smash
until every city across America is saved.
