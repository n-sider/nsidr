<p>In Japan, Nintendo is set to <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2006/07/12/104,1152690069,56706,0,0.html">publish a new game</a> by developer Sandlot called <cite>Marionation Gear</cite>.</p>

<p>Marionation Gear has the player controlling giant robots entirely with virtual controls on the touch screen.  Different sets of controls in the robots' cockpits give the player control over tasks from fighting other robots to racing and, apparently, construction work.</p>
