Nintendo of Japan is continuing its good relationship with independent Japanese studio Quest. Quest is the creator of the <i>Ogre Battle</i> series. Nintendo and Quest previously  worked together to bring <i>Ogre Battle 3</i> to the Nintendo 64. It seems as if that relationship was very successful as Nintendo and Quest are teaming up yet again, this time to bring <i>Tactics Ogre: Gaiden</i> to the Game Boy Advance. Nintendo has recently revealed new screenshots of the strategy RPG, and it looks very similar to the SNES versions, although they're a bit more "pastel" in color than the N64 incarnation.

Nintendo is overseeing and publishing the title, while Quest is handling the actual game development. The <i>Ogre Battle</i> series is definitely not aimed at the same target audience as the simpler Nintendo <i>Pokemon</i> RPG series. Nintendo seems very adamant about expanding its userbase focus on both its console and handheld platforms.

<i>Tactics Ogre: Gaiden</i> should be reminiscent of it's previous SNES and N64 incarnations. The game's battle system is, as in most strategy games, automatic. This means your focus as the game player will be of positioning and equipping your team for each specific battle. You're basically playing the role of a general. For example, if you have a barbarian and mage, you would probably place your barbarian on the frontline since his attack is highly effective up close. Meanwhile, your mage would be behind the frontline for cover due to his low defense and ability to attack with magic at all ranges. Of course, it's all depending on the current situation. Your setup could vastly differ depending on the enemies you face, weapons you own, and the caliber of characters in your party.

The <i>Ogre Battle</i> series also features a strong storyline and intriguing character development. This should widen the appeal to typical RPG fans. The <i>Ogre Battle</i> series has traditionally featured a wide selection of different characters to control and interact with.

Being amongst the first strategy RPG's on the GBA should definitely cast a brighter spotlight on this already acclaimed series. The game's huge following in the Japanese market will assure the Game Boy Advance has another commercial hit in its software arsenal. Nintendo is overseeing game development, and is likely to support its published title with a very nice marketing campaign in Japan. Hopefully this game will bring Nintendo even closer to Quest. Nintendo could certainly use a 2nd party that specializes in strategy RPG titles. Look for <i>Tactics Ogre: Gaiden</i> shortly after the Game Boy Advance launches in Japan. No word on a US launch date just yet, but if Nintendo of America wants to garner an older demographic for the GBA, they should bring this one over as quickly as possible.
