<p>Ubisoft's Red Steel game for Wii will incur a development cost of approximately $12.75 million, according to a report by JeuxFrance.com.  Red Steel is being readied to launch alongside the Wii later this year. According to its developers, the game will have approximately 13 hours of play time.</p>

<p>Wii is considered to be the cheapest next-generation console to develop for.  In May, THQ president Brian Farrell estimated Wii development costs are in the range of a quarter to half of that required for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 development.  What does this mean for developers?  A game such as Red Steel could cost them between $24 - $48 million on PS3 or 360.</p>
