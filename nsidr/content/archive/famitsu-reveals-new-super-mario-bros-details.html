<p>Jeux-France has <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news13083_new-super-mario-bros-scanne.html">scans from Famitsu</a> revealing several new details about  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876">New Super Mario Bros.</a> for Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>Mario now has the power to put on Koopa shells from defeated enemies, and the color of the shell determines what power he'll get from wearing that shell.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=341">Takashi Tezuka</a> is behind the production and level design of this title, which gives some hope we'll be getting a well-designed game worthy of the Super Mario Bros. name.</p>

<p>Speaking about the game's already-known two-player competitive mode, Tezuka said, "There will be parts where you must cooperate; still, I thought it would be most fun if it was basically competitive... its not just about getting to the goal first &mdash; there are... other factors."</p>
