At Electronic Arts' investor meeting, held yesterday, new CEO John Riccitiello noted that the company'd had its "toughest year" in its history&mdash;and fingered EA's backing the "wrong horse" by focusing on Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3 while discounting Wii.<br />
<br />
"Not a lot of people anticipated the success of Nintendo that they've shown with their wand controller and their Wii," Riccitiello <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6580&Itemid=2">said</a>. "That got ahead of us a little more than our expectations."<br />
<br />
Despite the slow start, though, EA was able to claim the second-largest share of Wii's success at 19%, second only to Nintendo.  <i>Tiger Woods PGA Tour</i> was fingered as the chief reason for the large share.
