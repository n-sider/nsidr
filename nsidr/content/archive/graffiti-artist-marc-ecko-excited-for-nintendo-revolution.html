<p><a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=12296">GameDaily</a> caught up with Marc Ecko, New York fashion designer and graffiti artist-turned game star.  Ecko made his game debut with Atari's controversial graffiti action game <a href="http://www.atari.com/us/games/getting_up/playstation2">Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure</a> for PlayStation 2 and Xbox.  The title received an average review score of 70 percent from <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920632.asp?q=getting%20up">GameRankings.com</a>.  Despite the somewhat luke-warm reception of the title, Ecko is determined to have another go, this time on Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed Revolution.  He revealed his excitement for the platform and its unique control to GameDaily.</p>

I think community is ultimately what the brand experience needs to be about, and I think that's what's going to drive our decisions largely and the ability to customize the art. I mean, the mechanic [the Revolution controller] is great, but it almost sets ourselves up for needing a separate SKU... We gotta do some tests... obviously the Revolution is very, very exciting. When we think about that, we get all geeked out."</div></p><br>
