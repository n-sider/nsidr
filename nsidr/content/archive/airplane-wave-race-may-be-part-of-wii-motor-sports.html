<p>I need to read my Nintendo Powers a bit more closely, apparently.  Nintendojo <a href="http://www.nintendojo.com/infocus/view_item.php?1152143292">spotted a tidbit</a> from the <cite>Wii Sports</cite>/<cite>Wii Music</cite> article on pages 38-42 of issue 206 of Nintendo Power where <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=17">Katsuya Eguchi</a>, producer of Sports, explains where they're going with the Airplane game shown as <cite>Wii Sports: Airplane</cite>.

<blockquote><p>One other Wii Sports demo shown at E3, a flying game controlled by holding te remote like a paper airplane, is actually part of a Wii Motor Sports category that might see the light of day in the future, said Eguchi, and could include other easy-to-drive concepts like a Wave Race game... As for the future of Wii Sports, the producer says that other sports may be considered for the line, possibly even for a launch title.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nintendo currently intends to launch Wii worldwide in the fourth quarter of this year, though they have yet to set a concrete date.</p>
