<P>Sega of America has opened a website advertising <i>Super Monkey Ball Deluxe</i>, a compilation of Super Monkey Ball 1 & 2.  Although the title is not coming to the Nintendo GameCube, you can take comfort in the fact that you've had both games for several years now.  The point here though, is to check out the amusing <a href="http://mybigball.com">website</a>.  Every Monkey Ball fan should be able to relate.</p>
