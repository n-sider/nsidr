So this is rambly and some of the analysis of a couple of the Zeldas sorta falls apart re: the thesis.  But it could go somewhere.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
So what am I saying is the problem in new Zelda.  Too many sidequests?  Too many MANUAL sidequests?  Too much talking before getting to the point?  Too much handholding?  I just feel like OOT is so trim in a really good way, I gotta identify what specifically that is.<br />
<br />
It's easy enough to identify Mario's core mechanics.  "Platforming."  Zelda is harder.  Puzzle solving, combat, exploration?  Town and NPC interaction?  What part of all this stuff that I consider filler doesn't count as Core Zelda Content?<br />
<br />
Maybe what Zelda needs is what Mario got.  a "NEW Legend of Zelda" to bring it back to its roots, really explore its core functions.  Then after a couple of those, those ideas re-integrate themselves into the mainline titles, like how NSMB and NSMBW informed 3D Land.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
You can classify this stuff as "plot" and "exposition" and "world building" and "variety" as much as you like but the fact of the matter is, filler isn't really very fun.<br />
<br />
Mario galaxy is my prime example.  After playing NSMBW and Mario 3D Land, I immediately noticed failings in the Mario Galaxy games that I hadn't really considered in any analytical way before.  Namely: they're full of filler.  Lots of running around to accomplish nothing, lots of missions that don't use the game's core mechanics (run n jump), lots of blah blah when you just want to get into the good stuff.<br />
<br />
Mario has always been run and jump.  Even in Mario 64's lamer levels you were still just trying to traverse an area.  Mario Sunshine introduced some lamer missions, but also provided our first glimpse of where Mario would finally end up, in its fludd-less pure platforming levels.  No bullshit, just straight up run and jump.<br />
<br />
Galaxy continued the odd mix.  Many levels were built around beginning-to-end run n jump, but there would also be occasional levels where you had to do things that had nothing to do with the core mechanics.  Racing, rolling, blowing up garbage.  In the name of "variety" we had to put up with things that sometimes just weren't very fun, and took up a lot of time "not being Mario at all."<br />
<br />
NSMB, NSMBW, and 3D Land could be called an effort to bring 2D back to the series, but what they really brought was purity of focus.  As 3D land showed, even when you have full reign over your environment, you can have levels designed to exploit the true Marioness to its maximum, rather than pad it here and there with random crap.<br />
<br />
I love Skyward Sword, but golly it sure was full of this kind of stuff.  Can't just go into a place, gotta hop and skip around between 8 intermediary areas to fulfill some quest.  And it's not even the pre-dungeon overworld areas that I find distasteful, it's that I have to talk to so many people in the process, and fly up and down through the sky to deliver things in fetch quests, etc.  I'm okay with a fetch quest when it serves to encourage exploration of a new area.  But there are a lot in there that just make you go from place to place that you already know.<br />
<br />
The area re-use really exacerbates the situation.  You feel like "okay I did this, when do I get something new."  Yeah the place is changed up, yeah it's new content, but you don't have that sense of newness that you really expect from a progressive adventure.  The world feels small because of it, and we end up performing tasks that FEEL like filler, even if they technically aren't.<br />
<br />
And gosh, people complained about Navi a lot back in the day, but Fi talks to you like 80x more.  And about the stupidest things!  "See this door right in front of you?  Looks important."  Just more consumption of time, more filler content (that panders to idiots in this case) that makes you wish you could just get to "the good stuff."<br />
<br />
It's gotten worse ever since Ocarina of Time.  OOT is lean the way NSMBW and 3D Land are lean.  Any fetch questy stuff is relegated to optional sidequests, and even then that's just part of one consistent quest.  In OOT you know where you need to go, and you just go there.  You may need to get a new item in order to make it happen, but it doesn't involve hours of exposition and cinema.  Go to a new place, work through it, find the dungeon.<br />
<br />
And it's not like OOT sacrifices characterization or worldbuilding in order to do this, they're just much more natural and innate, rather than shoved in your face constantly.  I definitely loved Kokiri Village, its various characters, and its design.  And I felt invested in the plot.  But it was accomplished in about 3 minutes and boom you're in the first dungeon, rather than the 30-90 minutes you can expect from more modern Zeldas.<br />
<br />
It started with Majora's Mask, really.  And I don't mean to be down on MM at all here, its worldbuilding and characterization were perhaps its greatest strengths.  It definitely began the trend of large amounts of running around and stuff-doing before getting to the real "meat" of a place.  But it was still lean and to the point in its implementation.<br />
<br />
Wind Waker started the genuine bloat.  I might not be particularly qualified to demonize it as the most reviled elements, endless sailing and the triforce hunt, I actually really enjoyed.  But I approached them in ways that integrated them into my general quest by always having my "gotta explore" hat on, so I was never really held up by the need to ever stop what I wanted to do to sail around for an hour like an idiot.  It definitely held a lot of people up though, forcing retreading and monotony when all they wanted to do was go to the next place.<br />
<br />
In Twilight Princess there wasn't really any one instance of bloat, but just little chunks sprinkled throughout.  Overall, though, it was generally pretty lean.<br />
<br />
Skyward Sword was the real tipping point.  Perhaps exacerbated by the area reuse, it feels like a lot of the game was just listening to extended tutorials, being notified about obvious things, and jumping back and forth between places you've already been.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NSMBW made me think that maybe the only way to pull the filler out of Mario was to go 2D again, to return to a much older paradigm.  But 3D land proved that it was doable in 3D as well.<br />
<br />
So this is what I want to see in Zelda.  We don't need to go 2D to make this happen (though that could be neat too), we need a return to OOT's leanness.  Everyone always talks about OOT and how it was the best ever and it's always trying to be eclipsed, but the solution to doing that isn't just with "more content."  You need to be judicious with how you use your content.  Don't give me 12 more hours of running around from old place to old place like an idiot, give me 6 more hours of genuine new places and dungeons.  The KIND of content is hugely important.
