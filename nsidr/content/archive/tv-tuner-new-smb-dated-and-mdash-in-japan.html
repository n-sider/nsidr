<p>Japan gets all the good stuff, don't they?  Well, Nintendo recently wrapped up <a href="http://ds.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=3341">a press conference</a> about all the new and wonderful things that are going on for the DS in the Land of the Rising Sun.</p>

<p>First off, as we reported earlier, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1743">Opera is porting their browser</a> to a Nintendo DS card.  The card will release in June for 3,800 yen (about US$30) and will include Kanji conversion software.</p>

<p>Moving along, Nintendo's got some multimedia aspirations for their device, as evidenced by the appearance of a first-party TV tuner.</p>

<p>Of course, the tuner actually picks up digital TV broadcasts available only in Japan, so there's little chance it will appear stateside.</p>

<p>The other big news is that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876"><i>New Super Mario Bros.</i></a> is finally slated for release &mdash; in Japan, of course.  The title hits Japanese shelves in May for 4,800 yen, or about US$40.  With a Japanese release so close, it's pretty safe to say Nintendo's worldwide subsidiaries will be announcing release dates soon as well, perhaps even for summer.  Cross your fingers, Mario-lovers.</p>
