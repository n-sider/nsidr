<p>Namco Bandai VP Shin Unozawa had <a href="http://www.thegamefeed.com/news-e7100db76b7488e8fb9009a3478f1550.html">some commentary</a> on where he sees Wii fitting into Namco Bandai's plans for the next console generation, speaking to press at Japan's Computer Entertainment Software Association briefing.</p>

<p>From a purely technical standpoint, Unozawa appeared to be interested in Wii's Nintendo DS connectivity option, as well as its unique target market.  "There will be many people who play with friends and family.  Nintendo DS connectivity is also interesting. It will probably become the Wii's touch screen controller."</p>

<p>However, Unozawa seems to feel less sure about the kinds of people Wii is targeting, and about how well third parties can really do.  He expressed caution over developing for Wii, which he feels would not target the "core" gamers that have long been the industry's bread and butter&mdash;in contrast to the 360 and PS3 platforms which he felt were a "non-risk".  In addition, Unozawa explained, "With Nintendo hardware, your biggest rival is Nintendo."</p>
