The Nintendo DS is fast becoming a veritable haven for puzzle games, and the latest to join the lineup is Eidos-published <i>Prism: Light the Way</i>, based on a mobile game developed by Morpheme. <br />
<br />
In Prism, players use mirrors and crystals to reflect, split, and color a beam of light in order to create an illuminating pattern. The game features over 130 puzzles, and an infinity mode, which randomly generates puzzle after puzzle. <br />
<br />
Prism: Light the Way is due to come out next month; a specific date has yet to be announced.
