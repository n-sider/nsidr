Ubisoft is hoping to challenge Electronic Arts' first place marketshare in the video game industry, according to a report by <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?view=CN&symbol=&storyID=2006-10-06T021650Z_01_N05184738_RTRIDST_0_MEDIA-UBISOFT-CORRECTED.XML&pageNumber=0&WTModLoc=InvArt-C1-ArticlePage2&sz=13">Reuters</a>.  Electronic Arts currently has a 20 percent stake in the company and rumors of a buyout have been floating for nearly a year.<br />

"Our goal is not to sell to EA but to beat EA," Laurent Detoc, President of Ubisoft North Americas told Reuters.  Ubisoft hopes to use its early start on the Wii to counter EA.  The company plans to publish eight titles for the console's launch this holiday.  This includes Monster 4x4 World Circuit, GT Pro Series, Far Cry Vengeance, Rayman Raving Rabbids, Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII, Open Season, Splinter Cell: Double Agent, and Red Steel.  It's suspected that Red Steel will be the best-selling third-party title available at launch.  Detoc hopes it will attain the same success that Goldeneye 007 did for the Nintendo 64.
