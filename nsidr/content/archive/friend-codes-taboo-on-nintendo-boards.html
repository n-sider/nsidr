<p>In Nintendo's official forums, the word is that <a href="http://forums.nintendo.com/nintendo/board/message?board.id=mario_kart_ds&message.id=42279">it's taboo to post one's Friend Code publicly</a>, or indeed even to help board members find other places to share their codes.</p>

<p>Doubtless this is part of Nintendo's family-friendly privacy strategy, but with a game that permits random matching, surely the potential damage done is no worse than stumbling into someone with lovely hand-drawn genitalia for their kart emblem?  We have no such problem with hands being tied in <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/">our forums</a>; we've even given members the option to list their Friend Codes in their posts by adding the code to their profiles.</p>

<p>Presumably, it's still okay to send each other private messages containing a Friend Code on those boards, but you never know...</p>

<p><b>UPDATE:</b> Thanks to reader Joe, who brought to my attention a detail I apparently skimmed over -- Nintendo's forum administrators also say that forum members are not allowed to share Friend Codes via private messages either!  Which leaves me wondering: how does Nintendo intend to actually <em>build</em> a Wi-Fi Connection community?</p>
