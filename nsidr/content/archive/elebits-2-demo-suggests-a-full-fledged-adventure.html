There really needs to be a better way to inform people when there are new DS demos available on the Nintendo Channel.  Case in point: I might have missed <i>Elebits: The Adventures of Kai and Zero</i> if I'd not been seeking out info on the title as its release approaches.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_left"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3818-1.jpg" width="186" height="280" class="image_nostyle" /></div>This new <i>Elebits</i> isn't much like the Wii title; it seems to have a lot more in common with 2-D <i>Legend of Zelda</i> outings&mdash;looking in particular like the GBA's <i>Minish Cap</i>&mdash;than the furniture-tossing title that graced Wii in its early days.  In the demo, I controlled protagonist Kai and his tag-along Omega Elebit Zero (as well as a later-acquired Fire Omega, who I could control to breathe fire on burnable obstacles), working through a number of simple environmental puzzles.<br />
<br />
As I went along, I could capture familiar Elebits to earn wattage, which I could then use to power various gadgets and perform actions.  Capturing was particularly neat; while some Elebits appeared randomly, others required you to lift rocks or shake trees with the stylus to expose.  Once they were out in the open, I could stun them with the stylus and then tap Zero to capture them, earning bonus wattage for sweeping a bunch at a time.<br />
<br />
The game gives the option to control with the d-pad and stylus or just the stylus; I found the latter option to work best.  (<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=47">Cam</a> liked the d-pad option better; seems to be a preference thing.)  There was the occasional control glitch, but for the most part operated smoothly and was fun to play.  The end of the demo hinted at a ton of content, some of which you can see in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6245&view=media">the media</a> we have posted.  Today, I've gone from "is this game worth playing" to "I think I need to check the full game out".  It seems... promising.
