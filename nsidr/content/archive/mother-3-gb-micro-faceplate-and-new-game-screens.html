<p>More presents have arrived at the Mother 3 website.  The website is being updated each week in preparation for the game's anticipated Japanese launch for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a> on April 20.  The latest update includes three screens from the game, news that a special edition Game Boy micro faceplate will be released and also a look at the game's boxart.  Still no word from Nintendo on a North American release.  We'll keep you posted.</p>
