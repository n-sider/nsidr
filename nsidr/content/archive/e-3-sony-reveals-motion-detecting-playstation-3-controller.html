<p>Sony announced during its press conference this evening that its PlayStation 3 controller will feature six degrees of motion detection.  This differs from the Wii controller in that it doesn't detect depth of movement, is not one-handed and finally does not utilize an additional nunchaku motion sensing controller.  It was also revealed that the console will release with two pricing structures.  A PlayStation 3 with a 20GB hard drive will retail for $499 while a PS3 with a 60GB hard drive will set you back a hefty $599.
