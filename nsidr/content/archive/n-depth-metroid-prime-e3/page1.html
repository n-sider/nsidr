<i>Metroid Prime</i> is being considered by many to be the game of E3 2002. It's kind of unfair for people who didn't get to play the game to have to swallow the "Game of the Show" title though. It really is difficult to understand the game if you haven't played it. The aim of this feature is to give people the best representation of what it's like to actually play the game. Some other little tidbits have been added as well that most should find interesting. There aren't many visuals to go on in this feature, but since we all know how beautiful the game is, it seemed logical to show some of the finer details. So, why bother extend this?
