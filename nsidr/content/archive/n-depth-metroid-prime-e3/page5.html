Anything that couldn't be fit in the other parts of the feature but were important enough to mention ended up here.</p>



<h3>The Plot</h3>



A lot of people were concerned with the plot at the show floor. The demo was said to be the first level of the game but that's a problem with a lot of people because you have all of your equipment to start off with. After doing a little digging, it was found out that it works like <i>Super Metroid</i>. After the Space Pirate ship is destroyed, you crash on the planet without any of your gear. So you're forced to go searching for it.</p>



Also, it was mentioned that they haven't quite decided on a timeline for the game yet. It'll occur before <i>Metroid Fusion</i>, but at this point, it looks like it'll most likely be a side story.</p>



<h3>The Music</h3>



Last year, N-Sider reported that Tommy Tallarico was doing the music for <i>Metroid Prime</i>. This is no longer the truth. It's been said that he did the sound effects for the game, but we do know for sure that EAD is doing the music in the game. The current rumour is that the original team is involved.</p>



So, how did this come about? Here's one editor's best guess. A Nintendo rep said that Retro had asked various people for demo tapes to find someone to do the music for <i>Metroid Prime</i>. Most likely, Tallarico was selected based on his demo tape. When Retro was bought out completely by NCL though, they probably decided to make a few changes. One of them being that the original team would be doing the music.</p>



<h3>Connectivity?</h3>



<i>Metroid Prime</i> for the GameCube and <i>Metroid Fusion</i> for the GBA are being released simultaneously on November 18th of this year. With the amount of discussion over connectivity by Nintendo at E3, you'd think this would seem a little too obvious, wouldn't you? Well, not quite. A Nintendo rep at the show said that Retro is currently toying with the idea but isn't too sure whether it'll go through due to the obvious differences in time lines.</p>
