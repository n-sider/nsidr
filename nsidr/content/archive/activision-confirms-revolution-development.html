During the meeting, Activision noted that it is actively preparing for the next-generation of games and game consoles. During the period from April 2006 through March 2007, Activision said it intends on releasing five PSP titles, four Xbox 360 titles, as well as three PlayStation 3 launch titles and one Nintendo Revolution launch title.<br><br>

After the poor performance of Activision's multiplatform title "GUN", it's speculated that over the next year the company will stay safe and look to its existing and established franchises such as Spider-Man, Tony Hawk and Call of Duty until the market stabilizes.
