<p>Perhaps you've already seen it.  If you're like us and not always on top of things, you'll find this two-week old edition of the <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/39">Escapist Magazine</a> quite interesting.  It's a heavily Nintendo-themed edition containing several stories of Nintendo lore and future prospects.</p>

<p>One of the articles covers the rise of Donkey Kong and its impact on the video game industry.  Another looks at the Nintendo Power magazine and its evolution over the past 20 years.  The final piece examines the history of the Metroid series.  N-Sider is sourced in this article; we appreciate that.  Readers are probably familiar with our extensive coverage of the series and its current developer Retro Studios.  We've highlighted the talented artists in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/the-art-of-prime">Art of Prime</a>, acknowledged the other team members in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/team-metroid-prime">Team Metroid Prime</a>, and detailed the extensive and turbulent history of the studio in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/a-retrospective-the-story-of-retro-studios">A Retrospective: The Story of Retro Studios</a>.</p>

<p>Stop by the Escapist and poke around.  It's an interesting read.  Also, be sure to read-up on N-Sider's past coverage of the Metroid Prime series if you haven't already.</p>
