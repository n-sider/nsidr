<p>In an interview with Gamasutra, High Voltage &mdash; the studio behind currently in-the-works titles <cite>50 Cent: Bulletproof - G-Unit Edition</cite>, <cite>Family Guy</cite>, and <cite>The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy</cite> &mdash; has <a href="http://gamasutra.com/features/20060616/vanzelfden_01.shtml">confirmed their Wii developer status</a>.</p>

<p>Chief Creative Officer Eric Nofsinger related this tale about the Wii Remote controller: "I had this sitting out on my table.  And our receptionist came in, and she was dropping off my mail, and just immediately ran right over to it, and was 'what's this?' and picked it up and 'oh, this is neat!'</p>

<p>"Never has she just run over and picked it up and gone, 'hey what is this thing, it's really neat.'  So there's something to that."</p>
