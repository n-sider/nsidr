After a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2646">spectacular January</a> in which the console beat off all comers, Wii was unseated this past month from the top seller's position.  Nintendo's not complaining, though: the upstart challenger was their own Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
According to North American sales tracker NPD Group, Wii moved over  335,000 units for the month of February, securing second place in hardware sales.  Nintendo DS sold a full 150,000 more units, moving 485,000.  Together, the two Nintendo systems had for themselves a majority share of the game hardware market at 54%.  Additionally, in the top four selling games, three were Nintendo exclusives.  These top-sellers include February release <i>Wii Play</i> and <i>Diddy Kong Racing DS</i> as well as Wii launch title <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i>.<br />
<br />
What's unchanged from January is that Wii is still <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2676">hard to get</a>.  It's most likely a problem Nintendo loves to have over the alternative of stale inventory, but the question must still be asked: when will supply be able to meet demand?
