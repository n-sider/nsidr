  <p>Masahiro Sakurai explained the reason behind his departure to Nintendo Dream on August 26, 2003.  The following is a translated transcript:</p>
  
  <p>"It was tough for me to see that every time I made a new game, people automatically assumed that a sequel was coming. Even if it's a sequel, lots of people have to give their all to make a game, but some people think the sequel process happens naturally.</p>
  
  <p>With times as they are, it's really difficult to make any money for yourself, and I know that I'm taking a big risk here. It's entirely possible that I could just fade right away without ever seeing the light of day again. But even if that happened, I've already decided to myself that I should keep on doing the work I can do, even if it's not all about games.</p>
  
  <p>When I look across the entire game industry, I think we're at a point where we can't get away with being lazy. The game industry is in big trouble, don't you think? Not a lot of people can survive off game sales these days, and the possibilities that games have to offer are growing smaller and smaller, I think. If games were able to receive a certain amount of support-if people had fun with them, if they sold well-then we should be seeing more innovative, more positive games come out one after the other. But that's not the future I'm seeing right now. The risks are so big that misfiring with one title can flatten an entire company.</p>
  
  <p>That's why you see places trying to stay alive by putting out tons of budget titles and re-releases. Every game company, no matter who they are, is desperate right now. So one possibility is that people will say 'I can't live off this anymore' and leave the game industry in droves. You see a lot of people use terms like 'console wars' and compare the whole thing to a fight for territory. You [the interviewer] and lots of other people in the game industry get termed 'Nintendo people' or 'Some other console's people' by someone you've never even met. But this is no time for that, I don't think.</p>
  
  <p>If I want to keep producing games as a business, then staying at HAL would be a more stable place to do that. HAL has its advantages. I get a reasonable amount of pay, living in Yamanashi prefecture isn't that bad, the rent's cheap, and I get national insurance, you know?</p>
  
  <p>But I don't care about that sort of stability. Right now I'm far more concerned about the fact that the game industry, which is built from the balance between developers, publishers, and users, is beginning to fall apart at the seams. I think it's possible for me, as a developer, to have people think about this problem through the development work I do. If I stay in one spot, then I can only communicate this to a limited number of people around the company, but if I can go out and reach more people, I think there are lots of people with far greater abilities than myself out there in the world. I mean, I'm entirely focused on games and I really can't do all that much myself, but if I can get in touch with people that have other great talents, then I think that will set off a chemical reaction and in the end we'll have a chance to make new games and better things. People with these talents might be at a loss at what games to make, and perhaps I can help make up for that in exchange for lending me their talent. This may sound idealistic, but it's really what I think.</p>
  
  <p>If one game sells 40,000 copies and another one sells 20,000 copies, then one sold twice as much as another, right? But if you work for a company, this isn't reflected much in your salary. No matter if your game sells or not, you'll get money deposited in the bank every month on the month, so sometimes you see cases where developers get indifferent towards money and lose the feeling that they're really earning what they make. On the other hand, gamers take money out of their wallets and use it to buy your game. This difference is making gamers and developers drift farther and farther away from each other.</p>
  
  <p>I talked with different people from around the industry about this, and it always seemed like the people who understood what gamers want the most are the guys in sales or the guys working in the stores. But isn't that messed up? It's completely messed up that the people actually making the games are the farthest away from what gamers want. I want to do something about that. I'm not saying I want to change the game industry or anything huge like that, but I just want to do something.</p>
  
  <p>But coincidentally enough-we didn't arrange this or anything-some people in this same industry, people that are fairly well known as developers go, are leaving or moving around in their companies. Other things are going on besides [Yoshiki] Okamoto's new company... It may all be a coincidence, but there are lots of people who think the way things are right now is no good, and I think it's great to see these people going in a new direction and taking the rest of the industry along with them.</p>
  
  <p>I don't think I can take any large-scale work for a while, so I doubt I'll suddenly become director on some grandiose project. There is a chance I'll be involved in several titles at once, but I'll need to think over the balance involved carefully. I may be seriously involved in some, but on others I may let the director and staff at the office take care of it and stick to just giving advice."</p>

<p><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/features/profiles-hal-halabschematics-q.jpeg" align="left" BORDER="0" alt="Masahiro Sakurai and Kirby Disco Ball" style="padding: 0px 5px 5px 0px;">It's 1991 and 19-year-old Masahiro Sakurai has the project of making a new Game Boy game, one for beginning gamers in which any player can reach the ending with mild effort. During the production, Sakurai needed a dummy character until graphics and later code, would fill it. The character he created was a cute smiling bubble. As development progressed, everyone grew to like the little blob so much that they decided to keep him in the game.</p>

<p>Apparently, Nintendo producer Shigeru Miyamoto wanted the character to be yellow but Sakurai insisted for him to be pink. The blob was first referred to as Popopo and then later renamed Kirby. Sakurai doesn't recall how Kirby ended up being named Kirby. While Kirby coincidentally has the same name as the Kirby vacuum brand (which has a similar sucking ability), it is unknown if this brand was the original inspiration. Another rumor is that in the 80's, Nintendo was faced with a gigantic lawsuit by the entertainment company MCA Universal, who claimed Nintendo was infringing upon its copyright of King Kong with the <i>Donkey Kong</i> Nintendo video game. Nintendo was still trying to get a foothold in the American market and this lawsuit threatened to destroy the company. The lawyer who was representing Nintendo was named John Kirby. It's rumored that a copy of the game was eventually sent to John Kirby who was humored and flattered.</p> 

<p>For Sakurai, there was reportedly some tension leading to the creation of a Kirby title for the Nintendo 64. As the original <i>Kirby's AirRide</i> was being developed, the release date kept being pushed further into the future until the fateful day when the game was cancelled. Its been said the cancellation was due to an inability by the developers at getting the four-player mode to work at a decent frame rate using the Nintendo 64's limited technology.  If there was more to it than that, we'll probably never know.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, it was revealed that the team would instead begin development on a new Kirby platform game (Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards) for the Nintendo 64 and that Sakurai would have no input. Supposedly, Sakurai didn't lay eyes on the game until it was released, where he played the game for the first time. Reports described Sakurai as 'sentimental', perhaps displaying the fact that he had lost interest in the series.  Even then it had become clear that Sakurai was tiring of what he would later refer to as the "sequelization" of the industry.</p>

<p>"It was tough for me to see that every time I made a new game, people automatically assumed that a sequel was coming," said Masahiro Sakurai on August 26, 2003, in an interview with Nintendo Dream, two weeks after his resignation from HAL Laboratory.  "Even if it's a sequel, lots of people have to give their all to make a game, but some people think the sequel process happens naturally."</p>

<p>On August 17, 2003, HAL Labs began undergoing major internal changes and restructuring efforts.  HAL Labs announced it had extracted its entire main Nintendo-collaborative development studio out from its Nintendo Tokyo Prefecture Building location. HAL's other team in the Yamanashi development center was not affected or involved with the move.</p>

<p>HAL's Tokyo Development Center, which was located within the eighth floor of the Nintendo Tokyo Prefecture Building, was relocated to HAL's main office building in Kanda Suda-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. The Kanda building is also supposedly the location of Nintendo's new Tokyo EAD studio and is where the Nintendo service center resided prior.  Instead of three offices, HAL now has two - its combined Tokyo offices and its Yamanashi studio.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/features-2005-07-02-halprofile11.jpg" align="right" border="0">The Nihombashi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo building - previously known as the Nintendo Tokyo Prefecture Building - now houses the complete Pokemon family.  The NTPB building, or of which it is officially called Kawasaki Teitoku Bldg. Bekkan, has been given the moniker of The Pokemon Building.  It houses The Pokemon Company, Creatures (creator of Pokemon cards, characters and scenarios) and Genius Sonority (Nintendo's new developer, who created Pokemon Colloseum) on the second floor, while the Pokemon Center Tokyo resides on the first floor. Several years ago Nintendo made the decision to organize everything Pokemon related under one roof.  This is said to be a part of both Nintendo's and HAL's restructuring plans.</p>

<p>Its speculated that all this may be related to the departure of Kirby and Super Smash Bros. producer Masahiro Sakurai just the week prior. Sakurai resigned from his position at HAL Laboratory on August 5, 2003.  It's rumored that Sakurai wasn't happy with the reconstruction changes being made and decided to leave.  Then again, the restructuring could instead be the result of such an influential and valuable person leaving.  It is more likely however, that Sakurai was aware of the changes being set into motion and used that knowledge in making his decision to leave.  This of course, combined with 'ideology' conflicts dating all the way back to the development of <i>Kirby AirRide</i>.</p>

<p>It was rumored that Sakurai found his creative liberties hindered within Nintendo's family and its development structure. "I left at my own free will, and not on the behalf of others," he said.  Sakurai explained that he creates games first and foremost for gamers, and not developers or other companies. He explained, "I have more sense of freedom working with other creators."</p>

<p>Sakurai assured gamers that Kirby will continue to thrive under HAL and Nintendo's roof, but expressed concern over the future of his beloved <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> franchise.  It has since become clear that one of the main reasons Sakurai left HAL was because he had tired of creating sequels.</p>

<p>"Every company has an achievement goal set," he said.  "For the company to make profits, they have to make the right games. I have no intention of becoming a member or developer at a new company."</p>

<p>President Satoru Iwata and Masahiro Sakurai have since held a number of reconciliation meetings.  As a result of the talks between the two Japanese gaming tycoons, Sakurai is now willing to work with Nintendo at some point in the future, although he will not be returning to his job at HAL Labs. Sakurai confirmed this report in an interview with the Japanese publication Nintendo Dream and also stated that Iwata was compassionate and understanding about the decision to leave HAL.</p>

<p>One can only hope someday that HAL will be able to replace Sakurai's magic.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1px solid #808080;">Conceiving New Talent</p>

<p>HAL hires new employees on a yearly basis.  Each March, while Mt. Fuji rests in the distance and the cherry trees are glowing in full pink and red blossom in front of the Yamanashi development center, new recruits begin their introduction and training for the work of HAL Laboratory.  Their nervous excitement fills the air.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/features-2005-07-02-halprofile16.jpg" border="0" alt="Cherry Blossoms in Parking Lot"></p>

<p>The new employees are introduced to the entire HAL staff during an introduction meeting and ceremony.  All new employees are trained in thoroughly with 17 lectures, everything from the corporate culture to the simple task of answering and using the telephone.  After this technical training is completed, more specific occupational training is performed. Altogether, training lasts for about three to four months.  Further lessons are held on a volunteer basis - including lessons on the English language, mathematics, design and art.</p>

<p>With Nintendo at its side, HAL Laboratory is prepared to grab hold of the reigns of the future.  Just as it was with the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube, HAL will be at the forefront of Revolution hardware and software development.</p>

<p>There's no denying the company has had a tumultuous history.  It's a lot easier to appreciate how far you've come when you actually had to work to get there.  From being on the verge of bankruptcy to tackling the difficulties of three-dimensional development, HAL has managed to persevere.  This perseverance is what moves this industry forward.  HAL's innovation, spirit and warmth is something we will surely see in the years ahead.</p>

<p>If nothing else, we've already had a glimpse of it through the direction former HAL president Satoru Iwata is steering Nintendo -- the idea that interactive entertainment should be played and enjoyed by everyone.</p>
