<h3>Final Fight Advance</h3>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/finalfightadvance01.gif" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="right" width="184" height="124">After only showcasing one Game Boy Advance title during Spaceworld, Capcom has finally decided to show another card in their deck. <i>Final Fight Advance</i> is an arcade-perfect port of the original blockbuster released in 1990. Capcom ported <i>Final Fight</i> to various systems in 1991, including the Super NES and Sega Genesis CD. The SNES version was released first, and it looked identical to the arcade version in many ways.

<p> It only featured two playable characters, one player support, <img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/finalfightadvance02.gif" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="left" width="184" height="124"> missing frames of animation, and levels were cut down due to cartridge limitations, however. The Sega CD version, due to its massive ROM size, was able to contain all the levels, but the actual game was still cut down in terms of maximum amount of enemies on screen, multiplayer support, and the loading times weren't exactly welcomed. Capcom produced two more SNES exclusive <i>Final Fight</i> titles. However, neither had the same impact the original had in the arcades and on the console.</p>

Capcom promises the game to be everything the arcade version was, and more. <i>Final Fight Advance</i> will feature two player co-op support when two players link up Game Boy Advances via the communication link. Capcom also plans to give the game a graphical face lift as well as add a few secrets and bonuses. Capcom plans to release <i>Final Fight Advance</i> worldwide some time in the second half of 2001.</p>
