<p>UK-development studio Zoonami has posted a new image their website teasing gamers of a site relaunch very soon. 

<p>What is of most interested to viewers about this image is the prospect that this maybe our first inside look at Zoonamis secret project formerly codenamed Game Zero. 

<p>Very little is known about Game Zero; however, former Rare employee Martin Hollis is the founder of Zoonami and worked on such hit titles as GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark, which is reason enough to sit-up and pay attention to this game.

<p>The image in question can be viewed at <a href=http://www.zoonami.com/> the following link</a>
