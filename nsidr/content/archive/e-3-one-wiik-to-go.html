<p>In exactly one week, the N-Sider staff will be making its  annual pilgrimage to Los Angeles  for the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Exposition (E3). While the show itself  doesn&rsquo;t start until May 10th, the press briefings and pre-shows  begin on May 8th, one week from today.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next week, we will be bringing you  past memories from N-Sider&rsquo;s previous trips to E3 (This will be our sixth year  attending!). Also, Sunday's chat will be a very special pre-e3 webchat, so mark your calendars for May 7th at 9:00pm EDT! <br />

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"> I pondered what I hoped to accomplish at my <em>third Electronic  Entertainment Expo</em>. &quot;Something special&quot; was my first thought.  What that meant exactly, I did not yet know.<br />
<br />
Is it falling asleep on the shoulder of Yvonne Payne, the sweet elderly lady  sitting beside me on the plane? Is it shaking Miyamoto's hand? Or is it  stripping out of my clothes and seeing how fast I can run from South Hall to  West Hall before being tackled and accosted by security? While I didn't know  what that &quot;something special&quot; was initially, I unconsciously realized  it by the conclusion of my flight. <br />
<br />
If a public phone is ringing, do you answer it?<br />
<br />
I realized the something special is and has always been the affection and  child-like yearning I feel for Nintendo&rsquo;s comforting touch. Nothing tangible  could ever hope to replace or substitute it. Unless, that is, you have a hair wrap  and your name is Miss Cleo.<br />
<br />
After a three-hour flight, I arrived in LAX at 11:10 PM to a welcoming rush  of warm air and the sight of resident writer Cory Faller and artists Aimee  Lamoureux and Matthew Musselman. Never mind the requisite Dairy Queen induced colon  cleansing mid-flight or the grabbing of a luggage cart from a man in SARS  face-mask attire, <em>I&rsquo;m at E3 baby!</em> With a backpack and duffle bag at my  side, the four of us grabbed a shuttle to the Inntowne Hotel - N-Sider&rsquo;s  official E3 accommodations since May 2001.</td>

<p>Being only one week away from what will most likely be the greatest E3 since 2001, brings an almost nostalgic and extreme excitement to those who are attending. For those who are not travelling to the show, N-Sider will have coverage from the show floor all throughout the days of the show as well as in-depth looks at the games upon our return from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we are still taking pre-orders for our <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&amp;storyid=1915">E3 2006 DVD</a>, and at only $6 with free shipping worldwide, it's definately worth picking up. </p>
