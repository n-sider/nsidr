<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-3-6328-3.jpg" width="166" height="170" class="image_styled" /></div>Alongside games that are more up my alley, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6349&view=review">like <i>Unsolved Crimes</i></a>, Empire also sent along a copy of <i>Animal Paradise</i>.  While I had a brief intense addiction to <i>Nintendogs</i>, I didn't really think I'd be up for trying this particular title out.<br />
<br />
Being a father of a six-year-old has its advantages, though: I had a willing daughter excited to give the game a spin.  Here's her "review"&#8212;as an interview, because as anyone who has conversed with six-year-olds knows, it's rather difficult to keep them on-topic.<br />

<b>Did you really like Animal Paradise?</b><br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
<b>What did you like best about it?</b><br />
<br />
I liked when the Chihuahua chomped because it had a wide mouth, then closed, wide mouth, closed.<br />
<br />
<b>Why was he doing that?</b><br />
<br />
Well, maybe the Chihuahuas really eat like that.<br />
<br />
<b>Oh, he was eating his food.</b><br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
<b>Did you get a lot of animal pictures?</b>  <i>(Animal Paradise's claim to fame is its association with <a href="http://www.hanadeka.com/english/index.htm">Hana Deka Club</a>, those "big nose" animal photos.  Making friends with animals will unlock photos for your perusing pleasure.)</i><br />
<br />
Oh, yes.  You can't wait to see Brownie's!<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6328&view=screens&imgid=20"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-3-6328-1.jpg" width="170" height="255" class="image_styled" /></a></div><b>Who's Brownie?</b><br />
<br />
I got 18 pictures of him.<br />
<br />
<b>You got 18 pictures?  Is that all the pictures you can get of him?</b><br />
<br />
Of every animal.<br />
<br />
<b>So you can get 18 pictures of each of your animals?</b><br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
<b>Oh, I see.  Did you play a lot with Brownie so you could get those pictures?</b><br />
<br />
Oh yeah.<br />
<br />
<b>What did Brownie like best?  Did Brownie like going for walks, or getting baths, or playing games?</b><br />
<br />
Getting baths, I think, because every dog would just shake their head like this really fast. <i>(shakes head vigorously)</i><br />
<br />
<b>Is there anything you didn't like about the game?</b><br />
<br />
No, but, I'd better tell you about Ruby.<br />
<br />
<b>Who's Ruby?</b> <br />
<br />
She's one of the cats I named.  I was bonding her on the face, and she went "meow! meow! meow! meow!"  <i>(Ruby is also the name of one of our real-life cats.  I don't know if she's been "bonded on the face," or what the Humane Society would have to say about it.)</i><br />
<br />
<b>What does it mean when you say "bonding?"</b><br />
<br />
It means to pet the animal.<br />
<br />
<b>Do you bond with your animals every day?</b><br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_left"><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6328&view=screens&imgid=13"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-3-6328-2.jpg" width="170" height="255" class="image_styled" /></a></div><b>How do you make new animal friends?</b><br />
<br />
By making it possible with the old friends.  If you make them a friend, then here comes a new animal!<br />
<br />
<b>Once you're good friends with one animal, then more animals will come?</b><br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
<b>So you have 18 animals, then?  Can I see them?</b><br />
<br />
<i>(starts DS)</i>  You should see the funny ones.<br />
<br />
<b>252 pictures?  Do you have all the pictures of all the animals?</b><br />
<br />
Yeah!  You have to look at Hunter G's picture <i>(her hamster)</i>.  He's on the island!  Here, I'll show you who I like.  This is "Silly," he's a chick.  Here he is with all his friends.<br />
<br />
<b>That's really cute!  So, do you think other girls would like this game?</b><br />
<br />
Oh, yes.  I'd better tell girls that I like it.<br />
<br />
<b>Oh, here are the mini-games.  What are in the mini-games?</b><br />
<br />
This is my favorite one, Shampoo Scrub.  Oh, it's Karen!  <i>(She plays Shampoo Scrub, a minigame where she shampoos, scrubs, and rinses a dog.  Karen is also my wife's name.  Kids name animals the darnedest things.)</i><br />
<br />
Daddy, the light's red!<br />
<br />
<b>Oh, well, you'd better bring it upstairs, I don't have any plugs down here.  Thanks for showing me your game, and telling me about it!</b><br />
<br />
Okay!
