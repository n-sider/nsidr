<p>Namco's Nintendo DS entry in the Tales series, <i>Tales of the Tempest</i>, now has <a href="http://namco-ch.net/talesofthetempest/index.php">an official website</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ds-x2.com/index.php?id=4756">magazine scans</a> over at DS-x2.</p>

<p>According to DS-x2's summary, the game will be fully 3-D and uses a battle system descended from Tales of Rebirth's Linear Motion Battle System, with additional touch screen and dual-screen elements.  Wireless play is also available for two to four players.</p>

<p>The game is set for a Japanese release, and preorders will receive a "Design Materials Collection".  Namco has not yet announced plans to release the game outside of Japan, though it's possible Nintendo may publish it as they are publishing several exclusive Namco RPG titles lately, including Tales granddaddy <i>Tales of Phantasia</i> for the GBA.  Let's hope.</p>
