<blockquote><font size="2"><b>G4:</b> Now Peter, I wanna start off with breaking news. The Nintendo Revolution controller. That was unveiled last week. A few weeks ago, you had this quote about never underestimate Nintendo. So I assume you got to see it ahead of time right?
<br><br>
<b>PM:</b> I mean... :stutters: you know, I've heard rumors about it for a little while, and I can tell you it's a great great product, and that's exactly what I meant by never underestimate Nintendo. You know, this is a Revolution. It's what they, you know, it's not the hardware of the machine, it's not the speed of the machine, it's the fact that that device will enable games to be made unlike no other have ever been.
<br><br>
<b>G4:</b> So you already thinking of ideas? You think you're gonna do a game for it?
<br><br>
<b>PM:</b> Well, I mean, you know, absolutely. It, it's so exciting to actually, for the first time, feel that you can move something in a 3D space. I mean, you gotta remember Jeff, that, the controllers that we're currently using on the other consoles, really have their origin in platform games. They have no sympathy for moving around in a you know, a 3D world, and that's what makes Revolution so exciting. Yeah, I would love to be doing something for it.</font></blockquote>
