<hr><h3>Magical Vacation</h3>
<p>
<b>
So, being as it came out in Japan quite a long time ago, is Brownie Browns first game,

Magical Vacation, not coming stateside?

</b><br>
<i>-Mark Martinez</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Though some release dates list the game as "TBA 2003" for a U.S. release, I

wouldn't count on it. It's a real shame, as the game is reportedly one of the best GBA

offerings to date. Perhaps we'll get a sequel...

<hr><h3>SP Import</h3>
<p>
<b>
Hi, I'm currently considering buying a GBA SP.  I'm in the UK and I've found
that I can import one from the US for about 70, as opposed to 90 for one
here.  I know the plug on the charger will be different, so can I just use a
standard plug adapter to let me charge it from a UK socket?  I would also
have thought that I'll still be able to link up with my friends' UK GBAs, is
this correct?  A final question about the Gamecube - is there any way to use
the memory card slot B?  Most games seem to ignore it, and ask you to always
have the card in slot A.  I know it's no great hassle to swap the cards
occasionally, but still, it seems a bit silly.
<p>
Thanks a lot for your help, and keep up the great work on a great site
 </b><br>

<i>-Arthur</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Your usual voltage-adapter should work fine for charging the SP. Linking up

will also be no problem; all versions of the GBA and SP are completely region-free, so your

Game Boy doesn't know or care where the system it's being linked to is from. As for Slot B

on the GameCube, it can only be used if a game is programmed to recognize it. For whatever

reasons (sheer laziness or lack of time may be among them), some developers opt not to add

this programming into their games.

<hr><h3>Hitman 2</h3>
<p>
<b>
I'd like to know the release date of HM 2 if you could tell me.

<p>And I'd like to say that you editorials are ways smarter then many.  I enjoy reading them

like many others and I hope you will stay as you are.  Keep it up. ThanX</b><br>
<i>-Thomassie Mangior</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Hitman 2 has no definitive release date yet, but will likely hit the

GameCube in the U.S. this summer. Look for the game at this year's E3. Also, thanks for the

compliments. As long as you keep reading, we'll try to continue to maintain our usual

standards for our editorials.

<h3>Raising sales</h3>
<p>


<b>
Hey I have a great idea on how Nintendo could bolster their sales and gain lost ground on

console sales. Actually several ideas really...first Japan, Nintendo helped fund development

of a game called Final Fantasy Chrystal Chornicles; so I assume that they would be

publishing this on this region.  Why not do a bundle promotion giving this great game away

for those who haven't bought a GC. It would boost sales to at least double of what their

selling now (I wouldn't be suprise if they start outselling SP with this bundle).  In North

America, which I believe they've done an impeccable job selling the system without going

broke or bleeding money like Microsoft; they could continue to offer these free game bundles

and to detter a price cut like Microsoft they could offer a rebate promotion giving some

bucks back to people who buy an SP or GBA.  Maybe $30 rebate for a GC if you  buy an SP and

$15 rebate if you buy a GBA. This would put pressure on the competit! ion without bleeding

too much money and sell 2 systems while their at it!!!!!  'Ditto for Europe also, but

instead pack in both Luigi's Mansion + Rouge Leader for the same price as the XBOX.  I don't

think they'll be losing too much money on those games and they are both excellent games that

appeal to both young and older gamers. Well That's my 50 cent worth  I hope Nintendo could

see this maybe give them some ideas.


</b><br>
<i>-M</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> A Final Fantasy bundle may not be out of the question, and I might even go

so far as to say that such a bundle is likely, particularly in Japan, where the series has

even more name-brand power than here in the States. Your rebate system is already in place

in Europe -- consumers who bought a Game Boy SP were given a voucher for 50 Euros off a

GameCube. I don't know how likely a dual game pack-in system is, but I do think it would

give sales a bolster.


<hr>
<h3>Metroid</h3>
<p>


<b>
Did Metroid Prime sell 1 million+ copies in the US before it was implemented in Nintendo's

"Free game with Gamecube" sale.
Also in regards to the possible multiplayer in Metroid 2, how about a co-op mode with a

second playable character in the main adventure mode, It would be awesome to take down

massive bosses with a friend.  Furthermore, as long as Retro doesn't include a morph ball

racing mode I wouldn't mind a multi mode that strays from the feel of the main adventure.

keep up the good work






</b><br>
<i>-Jason</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> It's hard to get a solid lock on specific sales figures for a particular

game, but most estimates have Metroid Prime at between 800,000 and 1 million units sold

before it was placed in the bundle. I'm not sure about a co-op mode for Prime's sequel, as

it could detract from the feeling of isolation that each Metroid game seems to try and

achieve.

<h3>Exploding GameCubes?</h3>
<p>


<b>
Hey hey, N-Sider.
<p>
Remember those GC disc-shaped discs that you could get at retailers and play
on your computer? I was just wondering what would happen if you put one in
your GC, and tried to use it. I'd try, but I don't want my GC to explode, or
anything.
<p>
So, you should try.

</b><br>
<i>-Mr. Bloober</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Sorry, it's nothing as extravagant as an exploding GameCube -- the system

simply gives you an error message saying that the disc could not be read. For more exciting

results, try fashioning a bomb from C4 that is roughly the size and shape of a GameCube

disc.

<h3>Silicon Knights and third-parties</h3>
<p>


<b>
Do you guys know if the Knights are going is confirmed to be a title at E3?  Also, there

have been hints that they have another title in development.  I was wondering if it has been

announced as to whether it is a GBA or another GCN game.  Also how do you feel about the

announcement that Nintendo is going to concentrate on showing third party titles (at least

what I read somewhere)?  I think it is great that they would be doing this, but does this

mean that Nintendo doesnt have the titles this year that will provide the awe factor as in

the past (for the most part)?  Any surprises????
<p>
You guys do a great job! Thanks

</b><br>
<i>-Geno</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Silicon Knights <i>may</i> have <i>Too Human</i> on display at the

show...it's hard to tell at this point. I can tell you, however, that it will definitely

showcase a surprise GCN title...maybe even in playable form. Speaking of Too Human, it's

apparently coming along quite nicely, and, barring any last-minute disasters, will make its

U.S. debut late this year or early next year.
<p>
Nintendo is obviously receiving much more third-party support this time around as opposed to

the N64 generation, and this E3 will naturally reflect that, focusing a bit more on titles

from third-parties. Though not a full-reversal, this is at least the beginning of a change

from Nintendo's old philosophy of only highlighting and drawing attention to its own games

for the system. Nonetheless, it's no secret that most Nintendo system owners buy primarily

for Nintendo's games, and I don't think this E3 will leave you disappointed in that regard.

For a brief listing of my own predictions for E3, see the <a

href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=qa/qa033103.htm">March 31 edition</a> of

the Q&A.
<p>
Surprises? It depends on what you're expecting. I can say with confidence that there will be

at least one Nintendo-developed title debuted that hasn't been heard of up to this point.

<h3>Nintendo in third</h3>
<p>


<b>
Do you guys think The Big N will be able to pull out of the 3rd spot?  I mean being in third

does not just hurt the company but also the gamers when they do not get specific games

because of sales of the console.  I know some people have the luxury of more than one

system, but many people buy one and have to stick with it.  All I know is having two systems

in a row in last place does not give me confidence when the next gen systems comes out.

What are your thoughts on the subject?



</b><br>
<i>-Ira</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> It is looking increasingly likely that Nintendo will be stuck in "third

place" in worldwide next-gen console sales this time around. If Nintendo cannot manage to

surpass the Xbox in worldwide sales by the end of this year, it's probably not going to

happen at all. The company does seem to be angling itself to be more competitive next time

around, however, so it will be interesting to see where the chips fall in the next

generation.
<p>
Please keep in mind, however, that "third" or "last" place makes the situation sound much

more dire than it is. The fact of the matter is that Nintendo is still an incredibly

profitable company, and in terms of profits is actually "first place" amongst its two

competitors. The state of the company is not nearly bad enough to cast the next console into

some sort of doubt; Nintendo is definitely intent on releasing it, and relationships with

third parties are continuing to be forged and strengthened behind the scenes. You'll see

some of the results of this at E3.
<p>
Unless console sales begin to seriously affect the amount of software you want to play

coming out on the system, try not to be concerned about it. The GameCube is still getting

plenty of great games -- first <i>and</i> third-party -- no matter what place it's in.

<h3>Nintend0 is teh K1ddy!!?</h3>
<p>


<b>
Hi N-sider Staff,
<br>
I'm a big fan of your website for over three years now!!! And to make it
short here is my question:
<p>
Nintendo made before "mature" games like Metroid, Zelda on the NES, the
mother Series which is so wired and modern in a way that you can't call
it kiddy. And they were working once with the FX chip on a Fighting game
if you remember that project! Starfox is also not a kiddy game I
suppose. And many other games who were internally made by Nintendo and
weren't kiddy at all. So why can't Nintendo make today games in that
direction? Is it the influance of Miyamoto ? Miyamoto as a game designer
is great, But here comes another question don't you think that Miyamoto
with his presence and big influence made others like gunpei yokoi at his
time and Tezuka lose their leading role at the company? So did a
Miyamoto Monoploy really happened in Nintendo? And if yes do you think
is becaue of this that Nintendo doesn't make "mature" games anymore?
<p>
Would be really great to hear your answer about this. your big fan

</b><br>
<i>-Arafat Medini (from germany)
</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> The "mature" games you cited all have counterparts this generation on the

GameCube, GBA, or both -- namely, Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion, Legend of Zelda: The

Wind Waker and re-release of A Link to the Past, the announcement of Mother 1 and 2 for the

GBA and Mother 3 in development, and Starfox Adventures and Starfox Armada. So yeah, I'm not

really sure where your assertion that Nintendo doesn't make "mature" games anymore comes

from. Even if they did, if you care that much about whether a game is "kiddy" or "mature,"

maybe you ought to take a look at why you're playing games in the first place.
<p>
No, Miyamoto did not "force" any other creators or designers from Nintendo. It is true that

he oversees many projects at the company, but there is no evidence to indicate that his

involvement stifles the creativity of other creators and designers; in fact, Miyamoto

himself is not actively involved in the direction and actual construction of the games

nearly as much as he used to be.

<hr>
<h3>At E3...</h3>
<p>


<b>
Will Panasonics portable LCD screen be shown.

</b><br>
<i>-Anonymous
</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> I think so, yes. If Nintendo truly is emphasizing LAN gaming as much as many

believe them to be, the screen could be a handy tool to help usher that in, though cost

could be a factor.
