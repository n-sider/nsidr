<p>Is it really the year 2005?  It seems just like yesterday we were hearing the first murmurs of the mysterious and mythical "Project: Dolphin", Nintendo's next-generation home console.</p> 

<p>And yet, we've already experienced and enjoyed four complete holiday seasons with our powerful little 'Cube -- from <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> to <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> to <i>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</i> to <i>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</i> -- although the ride has been turbulent at times, it's definitely been an exciting and unforgettable one.</p>  

<p>As we look to the future, it's very possible the 2005 holiday season is the last before we dress ourselves in black and lay our GameCube and Game Boy Advance to rest.  Fortunately, it also looks to be the most spectacular conclusion we've ever seen.  With the 2005 GameCube lineup including the likes of <i>Resident Evil 4, Fire Emblem, Geist, Advance Wars: Under Fire, Star Fox Assault, Odama, The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Mario Baseball</i> and more -- one can't help but admire the GameCube and Nintendo's determination to leave us with a memory of one of the greatest gaming consoles to have ever released.</p>  

<p>We've also been handed hope for future generations.  The Nintendo DS has introduced a breath of fresh gaming air.  This ingenious handheld looks to be coming into full stride this year with games including <i>Wario Ware Touched!, Puppy Times, Advance Wars DS, Mario Kart DS, Metroid Prime: Hunters,</i> and <i>Yoshi's Touch & Go</i> that take complete advantage of its innovative features.</p>

<p>N-Sider hopes to provide you with our unique perspective of Nintendo -- the company, the games and the people -- through 2005 and beyond.  We hope you join us, and who knows, maybe we'll be able to provide some interesting insight and speculation into the mysterious and mythical "Project: Revolution", Nintendo's next-generation home console -- a console that we will no doubt reflect upon five years from now with fond memories.</p>

<p>And while we're often focused on our small world of "video games", we must remember those who haven't arrived in this new year.  Our prayers go to those in Asia, and for that matter, all around the world who may have lost a loved one or fallen on hard times.</p>
