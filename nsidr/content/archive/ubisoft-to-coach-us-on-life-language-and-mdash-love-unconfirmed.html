Ubisoft has decided to <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=25183">jump on the non-game bandwagon</a>, expanding their current "casual video game business."  They're doing this by expanding their ever-growing Petz franchise first and foremost, but also by adding a new franchise to their repertoire.  My Coach will debut with two games: <i>My Word Coach</i> and <i>My Life Coach</i>.<br />
<br />
My Word Coach is on the surface similar to <i>Brain Age</i> in that it tests your knowledge and skills, but takes that a step further and actually strives to teach the user. It also focuses on vocabulary and language skills, as the title suggests.<br />
<br />
My Life Coach is "a personal coach that gives anybody concerned about their well being the willpower they need to change their habits the way they want in a motivating and fun way." No other details are available at the moment on this purported digital Tony Robbins.<br />
<br />
My Word Coach is currently in development for both the Nintendo DS and Wii and is scheduled for release in Fall 2007. My Life Coach is in development for the DS and will be available this coming Christmas season.
