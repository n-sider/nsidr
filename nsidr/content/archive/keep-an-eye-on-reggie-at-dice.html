The latest issue of Nintendo Power reminds readers to keep an eye on Ninendo.com on February 9.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of marketing, will be giving a speech about "Expanding the Market for Interactive Entertainment" at the <a href="http://www.dicesummit.org/venue.php">DICE Summit</a> in Henderson, Nevada. Reggie's speech will be 45 minutes long, starting at 10:30AM and ending at 11:15AM.  In the speech, it's likely Reggie will be highlighting Nintendo's strategy for its Nintendo DS, Wi-Fi Connection, and Nintendo Revolution.<br><br>
Anyone up for a Reggie Fiesta in the N-Forums <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/chat/">chat</a>?  We'll be sure to throw out a reminder as the date approaches.
