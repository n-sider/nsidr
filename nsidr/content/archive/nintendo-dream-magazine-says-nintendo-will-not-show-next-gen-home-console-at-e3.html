<p>IGN has translated a section of the most recent Japanese <i>Nintendo Dream</i> magazine.</p>

<p>Most notable, the magazine said Nintendo currently has no plans to unveil the successor to the GameCube at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>

<p>In software related news, GameCube sequels to <i>Mario Tennis 64</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> are currently in development.  Nintendo Japan is also currently preparing a release date for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=160&region=1">Wario World</a>, which was released in North America in 2003.</p>

<p>The magazine also mentioned that a sequel to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=135&region=1">Animal Crossing</a> is being considered.  There has been no official announcement on the game's development however the staff is quoted as saying, "There's still a lot we want to do [with the game]."</p>

<p>Finally, according to the magazine, the <i>Famicom Mini</i> series of games released in Japan a week ago have sold enough for Nintendo to consider releasing additional games.  Ten have been released so far and include titles such as <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=548&region=3">Super Mario Bros.</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=551&region=3">Excitebike</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=553&region=3">Pac-Man</a>.  Nintendo has a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/catalog.php?system=3&region=1">large</a> list of NES/Famicom titles to choose from if it decides to expand the Famicom Mini lineup.</p>
