A brief DigiTimes report published today indicates that Nintendo's plans to expand Wii production may <a href="http://www.digitimes.com/systems/a20070816PD217.html">be put on ice</a> for the time being due to a lack of availability of components.<br />
<br />
Nine months after the system's introduction last year, Wii is still difficult to find at North American retail, though reports suggest supplies are finally increasing in Japan.  Faced with this problem, it seems unlikely the situation will change, which could well spell trouble as Nintendo heads into the holiday season.  Despite the lack of availability, Wii has been selling at an unheard-of rate; one sales-tracking outfit reckons that it is set to pass Microsoft's Xbox 360&mdash;which had a year lead and is currently #1 in the current generation.
