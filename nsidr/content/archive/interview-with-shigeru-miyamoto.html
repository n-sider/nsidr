<p>Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly recently interviewed Shigeru Miyamoto asking questions about the Nintendo DS and online gaming.  Nintendojo has provided a rough translation of the interview, which you can find <a href="http://www.nintendojo.com/infocus/view_item.php?1101442405">here</a>.  An excerpt is below:</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">

<p><b>Q: Nintendo has said that the Internet is not worthwhile to its business framework, but would rather find out how it can make playing fun. I think the recognition of that is spreading through society in general. However, something more was said: when theres a use that lends itself naturally to play, then preparations will commence. The former statement seems very strong, and has given Nintendo an image of being against networking. Even at the presentation a few days ago (10/7), Mr. Kawazu of Square-Enix spoke very little about it during his appearance. Can you expand upon this at all?</b></p>

<p><b>Miyamoto:</b> The management of the company has lately had talks with all sorts of other companies about whether we should handle the Internet. However, that will probably bear fruit after three or four years.</p>

<p><b>Q: That long of a time span?</b></p>

<p><b>Miyamoto:</b> With the DS, I think itll be faster. I think it will take more time to get users and investors to the same level of interest. In shaping the future, were moving in a positive direction. I cant say anything more until its formally announced.</p>

<p><b>Q: I see. For something that interesting, I dont think Nintendo will be lacking.</b></p>

<p><b>Miyamoto:</b> Yeah, because of our cooperation with Square-Enix. [Smiles] I think therell be a hint hidden in Animal Crossing.</p>
