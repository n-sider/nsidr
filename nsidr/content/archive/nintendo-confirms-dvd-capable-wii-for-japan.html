GamesIndustry.biz has recieved confirmation of one tidbit from an Edge magazine report on Nintendo's upcoming home console Wii: Nintendo does, in fact, <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20729">plan to market</a> a DVD-capable version of the console for Japanese markets.<br />
<br />
Nintendo had originally said <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=541&page=2#wii23">a DVD option would be available</a> to Wii owners in the form of a self-contained device that could be attached to the stock Wii unit, but as release plans firmed up, said Wii would have no DVD capability at all, reasoning that small standalone players were already available at very low cost.  However, it seems that the company feels such an option may actually fly in Japan, at least.<br />
<br />
Two other tidbits from the Edge piece&mdash;the reported deal with CNN to provide news for Wii's News Channel, and the report that Nintendo wanted to set Wii prices lower but met with retailer resistance due to low profit margins&mdash;were left unconfirmed.
