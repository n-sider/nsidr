Swedish gaming magazine Reset recently interviewed <i>Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> producers <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=6">Eiji Aonuma</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> about the upcoming game.  Aonuma spoke first about his feelings for the final version of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</i>.  <br><br>

"When we finished the work on The Wind Waker, a small group of key people gathered [five] to talk about the future for Legend of Zelda," described Aonuma.  "At first our meetings was about how we would re-use The Wind Wakers engine, but every time we talked about Links age we started to feel insecure. We had told the story of his childhood so many times and felt we didnt have any great ideas. The turning-point came when we decided that Link shouldnt start as a child. When I told them (our team) about our new direction, everybody suddenly got some great ideas, and I suddenly felt that we should abandon all thoughts about a sequel to The Wind Waker and instead build a new graphics engine from scratch. A more adult theme made us go with a more realistic world."<br><br>

Aonuma also said he regrets he didn't have enough time to change the tedious Triforce hunt at the end of the game.  "When a project grows continuously, you have to split it into pieces," he said.  "I was the director for The Wind Waker, but I let different people be responsible for different parts of the production. I had control how things were going for them, but at the end of the production we fought against the clock and there were parts that I was forced to approve even though it didnt feel complete. I apologize that we didnt fix the triforce hunt at the end of the game. It was slow and dull. During the development of Twilight Princess, I refused to repeat the same mistakes; it means more responsibility for me, but this time we cant let things to go wrong."<br><br>

Miyamoto followed-up saying he also listened to the criticism received from the Wind Waker -- that the sea was too big and the number of dungeons and caves were too few.  Miyamoto said, "The new game will have more dungeons. Many more."<br><br>

Miyamoto is taking a more creative role in the development of Twilight Princess.  He is working with Aonuma to assure their vision for the game manifests itself into reality.  Aonuma said players can expect a long and complex story but that it will still maintain the classic Zelda feel.<br><br>

"To make the game dark is only one of our goals. This is a more serious story, but when you walk around in Toaru Village its almost like another game. The atmosphere is not serious at all. We want Twilight Princess to contain all sides of what people think of Legend of Zelda."<br><br>

In related news, Amazon.com recently added a date to the release of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i>.  According to the online retailer, Zelda is scheduled to release November 14. Meanwhile, Amazon.co.uk has Twilight Princess listed for a European release on November 25.  Nintendo of America nor Nintendo Europe have announced an official release date for the title.
