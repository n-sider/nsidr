IGN recently spoke to video game designer extraordinaire Shigeru Miyamoto. Miyamoto made two <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/804/804262p1.html">interesting</a> <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/804/804275p1.html">comments</a> that should appease gamers everywhere.<br />
<br />
When asked about Pikmin, Miyamoto said that he really would like to visit the franchise again, particularly because he feels the Wii controls would be a perfect fit. As he so lovingly puts it, "I certainly don't think we've seen the last of Pikmin."<br />
<br />
IGN also asked about Animal Crossing for Wii, and Miyamoto had encouraging things to say about that, as well. The director for Wild World, Hisashi Nogami, has been working on many different projects, including the Mii Channel, but he has recently expressed interest in going back to the Animal Crossing franchise again.<br />
<br />
Both statements should be reassuring to those who thought the franchises might have disappeared in lieu of Nintendo's new expanded-audience philosophy, which brought us <i>Wii Fit</i>.<br />
<br />
No more details were given for either franchise, but it's a safe bet there will be more shown in the future.
