<p>Speaking on the subject of the Revolution in an interview yesterday, Nintendo's President, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a>, told Reuters that &quot;<i>We plan to give details on when we will launch it, what the price will be, what the controller will look like and how games can be played on it by the end of the year.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Iwata then reiterated Nintendo's position on making games simpler and more appealing to a wider audience. &quot;<i>Right now, game consoles are important for the game fan, but for the rest of the family, it's just a piece of nuisance that's loud and eats up electricity... We want to create games for people who haven't played games but are curious about them.</i>&quot;</p>

<p>He also stated that the Game Boy Micro would be an addition to the Game Boy Advanced, not a replacement and that the pricing for the Revolution's download game service had yet to be decided. But said that Nintendo could charge per game, sell pre-paid cards in stores or possibly give games away for promotions.</p>
