<p>More information about the Sony PSP's pricing and features have reassured Nintendo investors the two companies won't compete head-on for the same customers, according to a report on Monday by <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=nifea&&sid=aMWZ4A0o485U">Bloomberg</a>.</p> 

<p>Sony's handheld is expected to sell for between $250 and $400.  Meanwhile, Nintendo's Game Boy Advance SP costs $99 and the regular Game Boy Advance model costs only $69. Nintendo will also be releasing its double-screen portable dubbed Nintendo DS in Japan this winter.  A price for the unit will likely be announced at the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>

<p>"Nintendo has the price and the library of game titles to hold its own against Sony in the short term," Hiroshi Kamide, an analyst at KBC Securities Japan in Tokyo, told Bloomberg. "The question is how much of a loss is Sony willing to take on the PSP."</p>

<p>Combined sales of Nintendo's Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP portables rose 18 percent last year to 8.2 million units.</p>
