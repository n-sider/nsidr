<p>Over in Japan, Nintendo originally planned to release all three colors of the DS Lite simultaneously on March 2.  However, they've posted a statement today indicating <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/owabi/index.html">the Enamel Navy and Ice Blue will be delayed</a> until March 11.</p>

<p>Nintendo offers its apologies for the problem, which stems from unexpected manufacturing difficulties, especially in light of the issues it's been having most of this year keeping the original model DS stocked on Japanese shelves.</p>
