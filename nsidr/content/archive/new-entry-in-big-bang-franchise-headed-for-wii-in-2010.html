<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6248"><i>Big Bang Mini</i></a> lovers rejoice: developer Arkedo is working on a new entry in the newly-christened "Big Bang franchise" that will release in 2010.  SouthPeak will once again be doing the publishing duties.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately&#8212;though details and a formal announcement will come later&#8212;I have nothing else to tell you about this game (other than the fact that I want it)... so here is a recipe for banana bread that is made with tofu.<br />
<br />
<div class="box"><span class="size_2"><b>Easy Banana Bread</b><br />
<br />
1/2 cup soft tofu<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3838-1.jpg" width="158" height="119" class="image_styled" /></div>3/4 cup honey<br />
1/4 cup sunflower or safflower oil<br />
1 tsp vanilla extract<br />
1 cup mashed ripe banana<br />
1 egg replacer for one egg<br />
2 cup whole-wheat pastry flour<br />
1/2 tsp baking powder<br />
1/2 tsp baking soda<br />
1 dash of salt<br />
1 tbsp poppy seeds<br />
 <br />
<b>Preparation</b><br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a food processor, cream tofu, sweetener, oil, vanilla, egg replacer and banana. In a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Add to food processor along with salt and process until creamy. Pulse in poppy seeds. Pour into an oiled 9x5x3-inch loaf pan. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center of bread comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes before removing from pan. Yields 1 loaf.</span></div><br />
Disclaimer: I have not tried this recipe and I cannot vouch for its tastiness or lack thereof.  The bit about tofu doesn't sound so great, though.
