Nintendo DS Lite mania is at an all-time high in Japan, according to <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/03/11/103,1142016092,49820,0,0.html">Famitsu.com</a>.  Nintendo DS Lite colors Enamel Navy and Ice Blue become available tomorrow morning.  The two colors were originally supposed to launch alongside the Crystal White version, however in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1782">late February</a> Nintendo revealed that it had encountered unexpected manufacturing difficulties and would need to delay the two colors by over a week.<br><br>

The Crystal White version was available <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1800">on March 2 and sold out</a> the same morning.  There were projections that less than 91,000 units were shipped.  Nintendo has stated on its website that around 200,000 regular Nintendo DS units and 450,000 new Nintendo DS Lite units total will be produced in the month of March. Nintendo had originally hoped to ship one million Nintendo DS varieties during the month.<br><br>

Japanese retailers are seeing incredible demand for an expected short supply of Nintendo DS Lite units.  Nintendo Japan has even <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/ds/nintendo-pulls-ds-lite-ads-from-japanese-tv-159585.php">pulled</a> its Nintendo DS Lite hardware commercials off the air for the time being, in an effort to contain demand.  The specific number of units that will be available for tomorrow's launch is still unknown (although some predict a similar number as the Crystal White).  Despite this uncertainty, Japanese gamers are lining up outside stores in mass.  Good luck to all those in line.<br><br>
