<p>Continuing the neverending parade of analyst opinion about Nintendo's upcoming Wii console, Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post <a href="http://www.forbes.com/digitalentertainment/2006/05/11/nintendo-microsoft-sony_cx_kt_0511wii.html">predicted this past week</a> that Wii will sell for $200 when it hits stores this coming fourth quarter.</p>

<p>The author of the Forbes story also notes that a Sega exec agrees with this analysis, saying Wii will sell for less than $200.  $200 certainly seems like the upper limit for Wii, given all the commentary we've heard since IGN spilled the beans on the rumored system specs &mdash; and at the same time, the story of what Nintendo was reportedly telling developers and publishers to expect &mdash; $200 or less.</p>
