<p>IGNCube published an article earlier this week regarding how Nintendo is ignoring the potential for a sequel to the GameCube release of <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>.  Nintendorks has published a counter-editorial saying Nintendo has its hands full with other franchises and has an overall experienced sense of knowing what it's doing.  Both are highly suggested reads and both bring up great points.  Check them out via the links below:</p>
