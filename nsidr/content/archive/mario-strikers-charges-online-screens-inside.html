<i>Mario Strikers Charged</i>, the sequel to the Gamecube original <i>Super Mario Strikers</i>, was released yesterday in Europe to officially kick off the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on Wii outside of Japan.<br />
<br />
Strikers is an arcade soccer game (or football for non-Americans) featuring characters from the Mario universe. Players choose a captain for their team, such as Mario or Donkey Kong, then mix and match a slew of different sidekicks, each with their own special moves. The single-player mode features tournaments, challenges, and single matches. The multiplayer is both local for up to four players and online for one-on-one matches.<br />
<br />
The game features a rather robust online set-up, complete with rankings boards. As players compete online, they gain points (a maximum of 20 per game), and climb the ranks. In order to encourage that everyone finishes a match, no matter how poorly they may be playing, the rankings are set up so that a player can't lose points&mdash;they can only gain points. The rankings boards are not affected by matches between friends.<br />
<br />
Friends can create profiles using their Miis and exhange friend codes to play against each other online. The Mii profiles will also allow players to track their progress in both the rankings boards and friend matches.<br />
<br />
Mario Strikers Charged will be released July 30, 2007 in North America. Those who live in Europe can pick it up in stores today.  The rest of us could, perhaps, take a gander at our <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=4175&view=screens">15 new screenshots</a> in the meantime.
