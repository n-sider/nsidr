Traveller's Tales' <i>Lego</i> games are rarely given awards for being the most polished titles on the market or for showing off highly innovative gameplay, but there's one thing that I've learned I can expect from this series, which I've messed around a bit with since the original <i>Lego Star Wars</i>&mdash;fun, if sometimes flawed, games with a humorous take on big movies that the family can enjoy, particularly in co-op mode.<br />
<br />
So I'm not really sure what happened with the DS version of <i>Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4</i>, which WB Games sent me for review along with the more traditional Wii version.  In particular, I'm not really sure who the game is intended <i>for</i>.<br />
<br />
Of course, the DS' small screens and comparatively low resolution do call for a bit of reimagining of any console title; this is to be expected.  But what we have in the DS version of <i>Lego Harry Potter</i> barely resembles anything else in the <i>Lego</i> movie franchise; if anything, it feels more like a generic movie tie-in game that had a few series elements stuck on, with Harry and friends manipulating Lego objects that just as easily could have been not.<br />

The characters in the game even <i>talk</i>, which may not immediately strike someone not familiar with the <i>Lego</i> franchise as out-of-place, but it is.  A good deal of the charm of the <i>Lego</i> games has been the acting-out of famous scenes from the movies they derive from by Lego characters who emote solely through grunts and facial expressions.  The DS version of <i>Lego Harry Potter</i> also includes prerendered video of some of the cutscenes from its console big brother, which makes the way the characters act in-game even <i>more</i> out of place.<br />
<br />
In the event that this is not a concern for you, though, you're probably wondering how the underlying game is.  Truth is, there's really not a whole lot of game to it.  Most of <i>Lego Harry Potter</i> consists of dropping into an area, seeing the items marked with a green outline (which you can cast a spell on), doing so, and moving on.  There's so very little challenge that it seems like it's something a really young kid just of reading age could enjoy, but&mdash;as a parent myself&mdash;I question whether a kid that age would have any appreciation for the Harry Potter franchise to begin with.  The books and movies are simply at a level much higher than the game ever begins to demand.<br />
<br />
I'm just not really sure who the DS version of <i>Lego Harry Potter</i> is meant for.  It's not going to appeal to fans of the <i>Lego</i> movie franchise; it's way below the level of Harry Potter fans; and anyone not in either group who manages to pick up the game anyway is simply going to find the whole experience a bit bizarre.  <i>Lego</i> movie games on the DS have clearly fallen a long way from the good fun of <i>The Complete Saga</i>.  I recommend heading straight for the console versions instead if you want to get your fix in (my review of the Wii version is coming soon)&mdash;but give this game a pass.
