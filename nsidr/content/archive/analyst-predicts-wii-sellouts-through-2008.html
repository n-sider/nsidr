In the wake of the wrap of past week's media summit, hosted by Nintendo of America, there has been no shortage of interviews and analyst commentary.  Perhaps one of the scariest for those still looking to get their hands on Nintendo's unstoppable Wii is the prospect <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6171552.html">outlined</a> by Lazard Capital's Colin Sebastian, who said "Based on our retail channel checks, demand still appears to exceed supply, and we believe that shortages could persist through the remainder of the year, including the key holiday period."<br />
<br />
Sebastian also sees third-party efforts confirming "a casual game focus" for both Wii and Nintendo DS, which is of course no surprise to those of our readers who've been keeping tabs on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2787">Ubisoft's coaching</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2791">Majesco's puzzling</a>.
