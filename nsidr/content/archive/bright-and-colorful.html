<p>We all knew the DS Lite was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1746">brighter than its ancestor</a>, but did you know that &mdash; unlike the unfortunately washed-out picture you got playing Game Boy Advance games on a Game Boy Player or on a classic DS &mdash; the DS Lite has <em>wonderful</em> color too?  Don't believe me?  Check out <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news14582_la-nintendo-ds-lite-jouable-au-japon.html">these pictures from Jeux France</a>.</p>

<p>We've heard from many folks that these are not empty shells with stickers on them: this is, in fact, actually what we can expect from the Lite's screen.  And that should please folks who are particularly picky about their screen quality.</p>
