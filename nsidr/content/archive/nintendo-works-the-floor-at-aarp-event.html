Situated near booths for the American Academy and Audiology and the Southwest Lawn Bowls Association, Nintendo <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/30/technology/30aarp.html">had a presence</a> at the AARP's <a href="http://aarp.typepad.com/life50/">Life@50+</a> event.<br />
<br />
Bruce Sanders, the AARP's director of national events, told the New York Times that tech companies are showing an increased presence at the Life@50+ events, with 18 companies showing this year compared to 10 at the last show.  Nintendo PR representative Amber McCollom noted that their presence was the first time Nintendo had targetted "grandparents" with products intended for themselves, compared to for their grandchildren.<br />

In addition to their booth presence, which showed off their upcoming <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Wii</a> home console, Nintendo representatives also walked the floor with Nintendo DS units showing <i>Brain Age</i>.  The Life@50+ show ran from October 26 through the 28th.
