<b><a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/732/732101p1.html">IGN</a> says</b> (7/10),<br>
"As long as you're willing to bring expectations down some for this Xbox-to-Nintendo DS conversion, you're going to have a blast with MechAssault: Phantom War. Still, the quirks are hard to ignore, like its somewhat glitchy visuals, sloppy menu systems, and analog control that could have been so much better had the touch screen been utilized a bit more tightly. Even if the game had a good development schedule, MechAssault does feel just a little rushed in places. But ultimately, the end product is a cool and kickass battle, both in single and multiplayer."
