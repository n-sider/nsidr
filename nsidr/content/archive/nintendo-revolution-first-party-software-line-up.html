We've been keeping track of Nintendo's every word over the past year.  As such, we're able to compile an accurate list of what Nintendo is developing internally for its next-generation console Project Revolution.  This is understandably an incomplete first-party list since Nintendo is such a secretive company, nor does the list even begin to delve into <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/a-third-party-revolution">third-party support</a>.  Don't expect to get that until the Electronic Entertainment Expo this May.  In the meantime though, take a look at what we've gathered.<br><br>

<br><font size="4" color="#336699">The Development Teams</font>
<ul>
<li><b>The Pikmin Team</b>

<ul><li>The team finished development of Pikmin 2 back in the Summer of 2004. Most of the development team has been unaccounted for in any of the recently released DS software. It is highly believed the directors are working on a new IP for the Nintendo Revolution launch.
  </ul><br>

<li><b>The Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat Team</b>
<ul><li>The team finished development of Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat back in December 2004. None of the development team has been accounted for in any DS/GCN software since. <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has confirmed a Donkey Kong game in development for Revolution, so it is highly believed this team is behind it. Although there are other possibilities... (Mario 128?) Whatever the game is, Revolution launch is highly possible.</ul>
  </ul>





<font size="4" color="#336699">The Producers</font>
<ul>
<li><b>Katsuya Eguchi</b>

<ul><li>The producer of Animal Crossing: Wild World for Nintendo DS said that he is working on a new title that utilizes the Nintendo WiFi connection service and that he is planning it for Revolution. (December 2005)
<li>Eguchi has also confirmed that Animal Crossing Revolution is on its way. "Nintendo's Revolution console will be Wi-Fi enabled out of the box, which means the system can wirelessly connect to the Internet for online gaming," he said.  "This, of course, makes it the perfect choice for an Animal Crossing sequel. The nature of the franchise's mechanics has always revolved around community functionality." (May 2005)
  </ul><br>

<li><b>Hideki Konno</b>
<ul><li>The producer of Nintendogs and Mario Kart, confirmed in a video interview with IGN/Gamespot that his development group is finished with the Nintendo DS for the time being. His teams are fully working on Nintendo Revolution software. (September 2005)
<li>Konno confirms to Wired magazine that his team has developed a cooking demo on Revolution which was previewed in the controller video trailer at the Tokyo Game Show. (September 2005)
<li>Mario Kart nor Nintendogs are in development at the moment, although Konno admits his team is brainstorming ideas for the next Mario Kart. (December 2005)

<font size="4" color="#336699">The Games</font>
<ul>

<li><b>Animal Crossing</b>
<ul><li>In May of 2005, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=17">Katsuya Eguchi</a> admitted in an interview with IGN that his team was already thinking of a sequel on Revolution.  "The reason why we created the Animal Island was to give something for people to take with them on the Game Boy Advance. Maybe with the Nintendo DS we'll do something similar between the DS and the Revolution." (May 2005)
  </ul><br>

<li><b>Battalion Wars</b>
<ul><li>Kuju Entertainment told IGN in an interview at E3 2005 that it would like to create a Revolution sequel to its GameCube release.  Battalion Wars for GameCube was originally supposed to include a multiplayer mode however it was removed in order to release the game on time.  "All we can say is, we're very aware of how important multiplayer is for possible future versions of Battalion Wars."  IGN has since learned a sequel is in development and the title will likely utilize Nintendo's WiFi Connection service.
  </ul><br>

<li><b>Donkey Kong</b>
<ul><li>The June issue of Famitsu revealed that Donkey Kong will be among the titles scheduled for release on the upcoming Nintendo Revolution. This is the first news of the cyber-simian, spawned in 1981 by Nintendo creative whiz Shigeru Miyamoto, heading for next-gen consoles. (June 2005)
  </ul><br>

<li><b>Kid Icarus</b>
<ul><li>When asked in an interview with IGN shortly after E3 2005 if we would see Kid Icarus on the Revolution, Shigeru Miyamoto said, "Well, I'm actually working really closely right now with the director of the [original] game. Now, whether or not when we get the Revolution all set up and everything is finalized...well who knows? That might be one of those characters where everybody says, "Hey, with the way our console is designed, that would be a perfect match."" (May 2005)
  </ul><br>

<li><b>The Legend of Zelda</b>
<ul><li>"This [The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess] will be, without a doubt, the last Zelda game as you know it in its present form." (Shigeru Miyamoto, 2005)</ul><br>

<li><b>Mario Kart</b>
<ul><li>EAD producer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=130">Hideki Konno</a> said in an interview with Nintendo Power magazine that a Mario Kart if not already in the works for Revolution, would eventually be. "As you know, Mario Kart has appeared on all of Nintendo's platforms so far, and I think it's done its job on the DS, or at least I hope it will with what's new.  So the next logical step, of course, is the Revolution. Really what we hope to do is continue to bring new and creative things to the franchise that appeal not only to our established user base, but also bring new people into the game." (December 2005)
  </ul><br>

<li><b>Metroid Prime 3</b>
<ul><li>Confirmed at E3 2005 with a short video teaser. "We plan on taking advantage of a number of new features in the Revolution, including the controller...The player can expect to explore different, quite varied environments in Prime 3...Phazon is a mysterious substance, and will definitely play a major role in Prime 3." (August 2005)</ul><br>

<li><b>Stage Debut</b>

<ul><li>When asked in an EGM interview shortly after E3 2005 if we will see Stage Debut again Miyamoto answered, "Yeah, I want to do something with it." (May 2005)
  </ul><br>

<li><b>Super Mario</b>
<ul><li>"I personally am pushing very strongly on Mr. Miyamoto to make Mario one of the launch titles for the Revolution. I hope that everyone [at Nintendo] is going to support it." (Satoru Iwata, September 2005)
<li>"Mario is and always has been a concept title from his birth. We are always looking for new ways of playing with him, manipulating him, to create something new and unique. We're in the midst of preparing something special for his future, something never before seen. You'll understand when you see it that we can't quite release it right away. The new Mario game will surprise many people. Give us the benefit of the doubt. I think we'll present you with a new way to have fun. There's even a new character by his side...  We based the Revolution around this new type of game. Mario 128 played a large role in the Revolution's conception, much like Mario 64 in its time. But we won't just be focusing on Mario. We're working on some very impressive games which push interactivity to the max. Games of a new era." (Shigeru Miyamoto, 2005)</ul><br>

<li><b>Super Smash Bros.</b>
<ul><li>Nintendo officially announced the game was in development at E3 2005. Iwata confirmed he wanted it for launch and WiFi enabled.
<li>Director <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=982">Masahiro Sakurai</a> revealed that Nintendo approached him during E3 and hired him (Sakurai just left Nintendo/HAL to be an independent game designer) to develop the game.
<li>Masahiro Sakurai confirmed in an interview with Famitsu, that Nintendo is assembling an entire new development team for Smash Bros. Revolution. Sakurai states that Nintendo introduced him to a company who just finished developing a big game in which the team heavily studied Smash Bros. as a part of the development process. The development team is believed to be Ganbarion. Sakurai then states that several of the Smash Bros Melee team members that lived in Tokyo have also joined the project. Finally, Nintendo is actively hiring new designers to join the team.
<li>The new studio will be located in Tokyo, Japan near Nintendo's Tokyo Office. The manager of the Tokyo office helped Sakurai locate office space for the new Nintendo Smash Bros. team. Sakurai expects the development team to be at least 50 members.
<li>HAL Labs has handed all engine code, art assets, and development tools from the original Super Smash Bros. Melee to the new team.
  </ul><br>


<li><b>New IP</b>
<ul><li>In May of 2003, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said he plans to introduce new franchises and is hoping they will reach the success of Mario and Pokemon. At the time, he stated there is heavy development towards these new franchises. At the 2005 E3 expo, Iwata reiterated the development of these new franchises.</ul>
