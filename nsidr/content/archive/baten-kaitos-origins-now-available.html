"Baten Kaitos II is a huge rpg (even longer than the first, which was already 60+ hours) that lights up a system nearly deceased at this point in time. For the most part the developers have done a good job fixing up the problems that plagued the original. Especially when it comes to having an interesting the story and cast of characters. This combined with a different, but still good, battle system and plenty more subquests to sink one's teeth into than the original, makes a product that's vastly superior (soundtrack aside)."

"This is a game that doesn't come down to a simple "buy it/don't buy it" conclusion, as it is entirely dependant on what type of player you are. Traditional RPG fans may not get as much out of this one as they would if it was more conventional, while veterans to the series (or newcomers that love the battle mechanic) will defend it to the bitter end. When comparing it to its predecessor, Origins does the series justice. The adventure is just as difficult, has a better overall story, and delivers more gameplay than the original with 60+ hours of play (factoring in every sub-mission)."
