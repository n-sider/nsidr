<p><a href="http://blogs.ign.com/Matt-IGN/2006/04/04/9389/p2">IGN</a> has posted info indicating that a Tony Hawk skateboarding sequel entitled "Tony Hawk: Downhill Jam" is in development and scheduled for the launch of the Nintendo Revolution later this year.  The title is expected to appear on other platforms too.  As such, the extent to which the game will take advantage of the Revolution's unique controller is entirely unknown.  No further details were divulged.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.activision.com/en_US/home/home.jsp">Activision</a> has faced criticism lately for its less than frugal use of the Tony Hawk franchise.  Nevertheless, some of the recent titles including Tony Hawk's American Sk8land for Nintendo DS are some of the most quality titles released; this title in particular has an 85 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/928406.asp?q=tony%20hawk">GameRankings.com</a>.</p>
