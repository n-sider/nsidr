<p>It seems Nintendo's hardware designs aren't the only visually appealing objects winning awards.  The <a href="http://www.nintendoworldstore.com/">Nintendo World Store</a>, designed by TGP Architecture and located in New York City, has been bestowed the award for "Store of the Year" and "First Place Specialty Store over 10,000 Square Feet".  Winners were chosen last month by the Institute of Store Planners/Visual Merchandising and Store Design.</p>

<p>"For the retail space, TPG chose modular design elements with cutting edge display technology," the press release notes.  "Movable kiosks offer flexibilitykey for the high-profile events, promotions, and product launches the store hosts. Nintendos entire product line is spread across three floors, two sales floors and a concourse level where gamers can hop on nearly 60 interactive gaming stations. The store also houses a floating video tower, housing nine rear projection video screensthe largest measures 100 inches diagonal."</p>
