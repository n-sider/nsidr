<hr><h3>No FF bundle after all?</h3>
<p>
<b>
Hey,<br>
Just read this recent Q&A and wanted to say that the "White GC" isn't actually a Nintendo 

bundle with FF:CC that people can buy in the shops, I heard there are 150 and you can only get 

them through a competition. So I think there isnt a FF:CC Gamecube bundle in Japan! :( 

 
</b><br>
<i>- Nic4321@aol.com</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Yeah, sorry about the confusion; apparently, the White GameCube is to 

<i>commemorate</i> Crystal Chronicles, and does not actually have anything to do with the game. 

If that sounds like it doesn't make any sense to you, you're not alone. Perhaps something about 

this news got mixed up in a Japanese-to-American translation? Anyhow, the final statement from 

me goes something like this: to my knowledge, there is no FF:CC Japanese bundle being planned. 

I think such a thing would be a smart idea, but as far as I know right now, it isn't going to 

happen. This falls in line with Nintendo's relatively silent standing on the game so far (with 

regard to hype and advertising) as it nears release in Japan...

<hr><h3>Punch Out</h3>
<p>
<b>


I was just wondering if we are ever going to see a revival from one of the best
boxing games ever.  During my youth I spent many days fighting Super Macho Man,
Soda Popinski and everyone's favorite King Hippo.  Who could forget running
after your trainer on a bike.  So what are the chances that I could relive the
glory in the ring with a new Punch Out.  It would def need to have a multiplayer
though and maybe lan play to fight your buddy.  Oh yeah Mario needs to be the
ref too.  So what are my chances of getting back into the ring anytime soon?

<p><b>Josh:</b> I'd say it's definitely a possibility. The franchise has been tossed around in 

interviews before -- once or twice even with Mr. Miyamoto himself -- and rumours that the game 

is being worked on constantly surface and then disappear. I'd put my chips on a new Punch Out 

someday, but whether that's sooner or later is anyone's guess.

<hr><h3>More FF questions</h3>
<p>
<b>
Dear N-sider <br>
                  I have been a big fan of FF since nes days and being that I am old fashioned, 

I am still a one console gamer.  That means I have not played any FF since SNES.  Here where 

question comes.  I know how they are emphasizing the multiplayer aspect FFCC and thats great 

and all because I really liked Secret of Mana.  Here's the thing though I play my games at all 

different times and I don't usually call my friends at 2 in the morn to help me defeat a 

dragon.  So will my playing alone take away from the fun, because that is my final decision on 

whether getting the game.  Thanx in advance

<p><b>Josh:</b> Well, although you playing solo won't make the game dull or boring by any 

means, I'd be lying if I told you that it's as much fun as the multiplayer quest. The fact of 

the matter is, FF:CC was designed with multiple players (and Game Boy Advances) in mind; taking 

away these elements will naturally knock down the enjoyment factor a few pegs. For more

<h3>Lots of stuff.</h3>

Hi! Great site you have here, i would like to ask you a few questions.<br>
1-Any news on Too Human? i've read that igncube pal Matt said that this game might be delayed 

for a release with the next Nintendo's Console, is this true(now including Pilot Wings from 

Factor5)???<br>
2-Any news on a new Kid Icarus game or old forgotten franchise??<br>
3-Also do you know what were the two well known companies that gamefront.de rumoured to be 

changing to Nintendo's side???<br>
4-When is Capcom going to properly show RE4???we've seen so little of the game......<br>
5-Zoonami, is the company actually alive???<br> Regards, 








</b><br>
<i>-Joo Rossa</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> 1) Yeah, the current word now is that the game may see a delay. I think Silicon 

Knights has at least one more GameCube release in them after the Metal Gear remake, but we'll 

see if that is indeed Too Human, Eternal Darkness 2, or something else entirely. 2) Kid Icarus: 

sorry, nothing has surfaced since a few scattered rumours about an update to the franchise 

following the Smash Brothers Melee trophy inclusion. I really don't think any Pit game is in 

development right now. 3) This was a rumour from a while back that never really panned out, if 

memory serves me correctly. Depending on the date of the story, it's possible the site was 

alluding to Capcom's GCN support and Konami lending out the Metal Gear franchise. 4) Don't 

expect to see much more for at least a little while...remember, the game isn't scheduled to 

come out until 2004. 5) Yes, they're alive, and they're working very hard...and apparently, 

it's showing. Even though we've seen or heard practically nothing about Game Zero, I'm very 

interested in seeing it. Don't dismiss Zoonami just because we haven't heard from them in a 

while.

<h3>N-Sider game lists</h3>
<p>


<b>
why are you missing so many games? you only have about an eighth of all the gcn and gba games..









</b><br>
<i>-Jonathan Montroy</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Our games list is comprised of games we have covered here on the site, not all games in existence. Once we write something about a game, it is added to the list.

<p><b>Cory:</b> Yeah, as suprising as it may be, the majority of the N-Sider staff lead very busy lives.  We simply don't have the manpower to cover every single game out there.  For the sake of practicality, we typically cover whatever games we think the readers would care about the most, or whatever games publishers ship us.  Maybe if we one day turn this site into an actual paying career, ala IGN, we might be able to cover every game out there.  But until then (if ever), we'll just continue to do the best that we can.

<h3>Soul Calibur: better on PS2 or the Cube?</h3>
<p>


<b>

Hi,
<br> 
I dont know whether to get the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur 2 or the Playstation 2 version. 

 I'm torn between the "beat 'em up friendly" controls of the Playstation 2 or the inclusion of 

Link in the Gamecube version.  Somehow, I have this horrible vision that I wont be able to pull 

off the slick combos I did in Soul Calibur 1 on the Dreamcast, with Gamecubes Control system.  

So I'm wondering which version to have and do you have any ideas on which version to get?<br> 
Also, does all the talk of Sony's PSP (and how it would fail against the GBA) sound very 

reminiscent of all the talk about the Playstation 2 would definitaly flop and bankrupt Sony 

Entertainment due the hard development cycle, very poor games at launch, the influence of the 

dreamcast and the infamous "jaggies". Think about it :)   Thanks, 






</b><br>
<i>-Laurence</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> The controls actually work fairly well on the GameCube controller. Depending on 

your preference, you might get a bit more comfort from using a PS2 pad, but I don't think it's 

anything to really concern yourself with (on a side note, if you're really serious about the 

game, I'd recommend using a Hori Arcade stick for superior control). Anyway, once that factor 

is cleared up, it becomes obvious that the GCN version is the best choice (the inclusion of 

Link and slightly cleaned-up graphics). 

<p><b>Cory:</b> Based on my experiences at E3, Soul Calibur 2 controlled fantastically on the GameCube controller.  The only problem I had was trying to execute one of the throws that you perform by pressing B and X simultaneously.  It's nigh impossible to press those two buttons with only one finger.  I heard that you can map certain things to L or R, though, so if you can stick that throw onto one of the shoulder buttons, I have absolutely no qualms with the controller.  Many people will claim that they hate the idea of using the joystick instead of the D-Pad, but I don't personally find it to be that problematic at all.  But then, that's just a matter of preference.

<h3>Howard Phillips</h3>
<p>


<b>

Hi N-sider,<br>
Do you know what happened to Howard Phillips?  The guy who used to work for
Nintendo and the star of "Howard and Nester" (the old comic that ran in Nintendo
Power).  I remember he was so strongly 
associated with the company, and in the book "Game Over' it seems he had a large
role in helping build the company in America. I think it would be neat if you found him and 

interviewed him or wrote an
article about him.

Thanks and keep up the great work!







</b><br>
<i>-Ryan Yoo</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Howard -- who actually was the President of NOA for some time -- eventually 

left the company in the early '90's to "pursue other goals".

<h3>Nintendo no longer innovative?</h3>
<p>


<b>

Dear N-Sider, 
<br>
    I would like to know what you opinionate on the dilemma of veteran gamers.  I have been a 

Nintendo loyalist since I got my NES at the age of 1 in 1987.  I dabbled in some Sega gaming 

with the Genesis, but I was really only interested in their selection of Marvel Comics games 

since comics were my bigger obsession as a child.  Anyway, I have always been loyal to Ninendo, 

until what I like to call 'The Abomination."  This in reference to that cursed little purple 

box atop my VCR.  So far, it has not provided anything significantly revolutionary like the 

previous Nintendo consoles, and it certainly doesn't seem to have anything for the future 

either.  Not to say that I don't enjoy going through the games, but I haven't been truly 

enamored by any of the Gamecube's supposed heavy hitters.  The modern games can't seem to jump 

from the realm of entertainment to captivation like the good old days of Nintendo gaming. 
<p>
    Just 3 short years ago I remember playing through the slightly-more-modern greats such as 

Majora's Mask, Super Smash Bros., Ocarina of Time, and to an extent Mario Golf/Tennis/Party.  

Since then, the only title of those mentioned to receive a notable improvement was Smash Bros.  

SSBM is the only game on the Gamecube that I can always pick up and have fun with, and that 

when I was playing through the first time, I was completely engrossed.  All the other titles 

have either been complete rehashses with supposed improvements added, or a sub-satisfactory 

cash-in title.  Take, for example, Super Mario Sunshine.  Though very fun to play through, it 

just didn't have the innovations that did Mario 64.  The water pack, though its controls were 

crafted appropriately, just wasn't anywhere near enough to make the game a classic.  Another 

example: Wind Waker.  I absolutely despised the graphics.  They would have been great on a 

Mario title, and it would have made any Mario game much more entertaining, but not on Zelda.  I 

was thoroughly disgusted looking at Link while playing through the game.  Furthermore, it is 

the easiest Zelda to date, the game's map was wasted with a fairly barren ocean, and the game 

is riddled with anachronisms (such as Ganondorf, who should've been Ganon).  The game was fun 

(except for the collecting of the Triforce fragments), but I felt that it stepped on the 

history of Zelda and left an irreparable dent in my Zelda fanaticism. 
<p>
    The aforementioned illustrate my plight: I feel that I am simply not receiving products of 

the same quality as in years past.  Regardless of graphics, extras, length, and all the other 

glitter tossed about in the modern gaming public, these games are, at heart, merely rehashes of 

their predecessors with a few corny changes tossed in (Island themes in both of the previously 

mentioned games).  I wanted to see the power of the Gamecube harnessed to create a majestic 

vision of the land of Hyrule, not wasted on a lifeless ocean.  Unfortunately, much like Link, 

Nintendo has been pulled in by the violent current of modern gaming's figurative sea. 







</b><br>
<i>-CaptainCC</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> It occurs to me that people like you who complain that Nintendo is no longer 

innovative always conveniently fail to mention titles such as Pikmin, Animal Crossing, and to a 

lesser extent, Metroid Prime. Haven't you played any of those? You also fit in with others 

clamouring for originality in that you seem to hold this quality as the Holy Grail of gaming. A 

"freshness" to a game can help it, but it does not necessitate or guarantee fun. F-Zero GX, as 

a sequel in the most successful futuristic racer franchise of all time, is certainly not new, 

but I promise you that it's going to be one hell of a game this August. If you reserve your 

gaming only for titles which you consider innovative, you're going to be playing games once 

every solar eclipse or so. Fresh and new ideas simply cannot flow constantly. It's fine to 

enjoy those types of games, and to an extent, it's fine to realize that Nintendo has admittedly 

not delivered a major franchise (ex., a Mario or a Zelda) that significantly alters the gaming 

playing field. But until that does happen, enjoy fresh, quality games that do come along -- 

such as Pikmin -- as well as those that may not be the newest concept in the world, but are 

still plenty of fun. If you can't do this, then stop playing.

<p><b>Cory:</b> What Josh said.  In regards to your Ganondorf/Ganon comment, though, it's not nearly as problematic as you might think.  Check the next question in this week's Q&A, and keep glued to the site in the coming days/weeks.  All shall be explained.

<h3>Attention Cory</h3>
<p>


<b>

I read your storyline for zelda and liked it very much but when are you going to include the 

wind waker? 







</b><br>
<i>-TriLZWaKer7</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Ask Cory -- he's the one responsible for the superb timeline. Hopefully he'll 

add his reply here, and if not, you can always mail him directly at <a 

href="mailto:cory@n-sider.com">cory@n-sider.com</a>.

<p><b>Cory:</b> What if I told you to expect it up by next Monday?  That'd be awfully optomistic of me, that's what.  I'm doing more than just adding a chapter for the Wind Waker; I'm doing a very large amount of editing to all of the already existing chapters.  The OOT chapter alone has more than doubled in size, and I'm not even done with it.  Now, my plan is to use as much of this weekend as I can to try and get it all finished, but I can't make any promises.  So look for the revision/update as soon as next Monday, and if not then, then hopefully very soon afterwards.
