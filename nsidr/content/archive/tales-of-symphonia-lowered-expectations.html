We added <i>Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</i> (also known in GameStop's e-mail flyer as <i>Tales of Etc.</i>) to our Wii library the other night.  My wife sort of surprised me by insisting she wanted to play alongside me; we haven't really been doing that with Big Games since the kids starting eating up our lives.  But, I digress.<br />
<br />
Going in, there was quite the wave of negativity to contend with.  Import impressions were iffy, to be charitable.  IGN's review&#8212;while, well, <i>IGN's</i> and thus expected to be unreliable in some regard&#8212;was pretty rough.  GameTrailers put out a pretty good-sounding review that suddenly (and I do mean out-of-the-blue) ended in a litany of complaint.  I obsessed over whether it still made sense to buy the game.<br />

I'm not so certain that the ragging was deserved.  The game is a little rough, there's no doubt about that; but it's been fun thus far.  It's got a solid battle system without any obligatory waggle (though you can map a few extra special attacks to shakes, if you want), and the monster party members are more interesting than I thought they'd be.  I'm going to miss it this weekend as I put it back on the shelf while my wife's out of town.<br />
<br />
If you were on the fence like me, wanting to play this game, but afraid of the negativity, let me assuage your fears.  I'm not exactly a series vet&#8212;I've only played <i>Symphonia</i> and <i>Phantasia</i> besides&#8212;but I think it's a rather enjoyable title.  I definitely don't expect to get to the end thinking I've been bilked out of $40.
