<h4>September 22nd, 2000</h4>

<p>Hey guys gotta say this site keeps getting better and better.  I especially like your "post-as-it-comes-in" approach.  This has now turned into my favorite site for my daily Nintendo news.  Keep it up!

<p>Anyways down to the question:  What is it with square?  I personally don't really care if they "defect" back to the big N but I mean honestly why has nobody put in their honest opinion on the situation.  I mean why has nobody said : "Square will not go to Nintendo because..." or "Square will go back to Nintendo because...".  Every time somebody asks what the editor's opinion is on the situation all that is said is "well, it's tough to say because..". ACK!  Geez I am in to the Nintendo dirt and have been for years and years but you guys are more in the know then I am so I am sure that one of you can give us a STRAIGHT opinion on square's "defect".  

<p>question 2:  When will 3rd parties be recieving dev kits so they can show off software to us who scrape at the latest rebirth screens and the such.  I mean I don't know If im going to believe that there will be no big news between now and E3 concerning our favorite cube.  Come on.  I have a feeling that a developer is going to do the old "well I shouldn't tell you this but..".  What kind of info leaks do you think that there will be? maybe this thing Nintendo is hiding is already disclosed with 3rd parties? what is your take?  PEACE.

<p><b>Pete: Thanks for the comments! On to the questions-- <p>1.) It appears that Square might be breaking their "Playstation-only" status quo soon. Who does Nintendo have to thank for that? Microsoft. The XBox is luring in many 3rd party developers, and I think that could help Nintendo to get some extra 3rd party support their way as well. 

<p> 2.) Third-party teams should be receiving full development kits this month and in October onward. We do know Miyamoto-san and another NCL rep stated Nintendo would possibly be having some kind of event for 3rd parties in late September/October. Will there be news leaks from developers before E3? Of course there will be-- especailly when full kits go out to the bulk of the development community.</b>

<p>Wave Race 64.  It was the first N64 game I bought, and still my favourite 
racer after all these years.  What better game to display the N64's texture 
capabilities by showing the world that realistic water effects and physics 
were possible on home consoles?  Years later, no other game has surpassed 
Wave Race's water experience, but after wetting my pants when I witnessed 
the Wave Race demo on the Nintendo GameCube, it seems that that same water 
experience will be pushed up to another level.  Your preview on the game was 
great, and I gotta say that your site is top notch!! Good work!!

<p>What I would like to know is, if the original team that made Wave Race 
aren't going to develop the game this time, that would mean that they're 
working on a game MORE important than WaveRace, specifically what game/s do 
you think they're working on?

<p>You also have to remember that this is the same team that created the 
phenomenal 1080 Snowboarding, arguably the best snowboarding game in 
existence!! And they did cease work on the sequel for the N64 due to 'other' 
reasons.   So, do you think that there's a good chance that there'll be a 
sequel to 1080 on the GameCube?

<p>Lastly, why aren't you guys an IGN affiliate?

<p>Thanx guys!! Your site rocks!! All hail the GAMECUBE!!

<p><b>Pete: I have to agree, WaveRace was, in my opinion, one of the most impressive demos at Spaceworld. If the final game looks even better than that, I'll be in heaven. The EAD team that made the original WaveRace is obviously working on something else. What do I think it is? Expect the unexpected. I think Nintendo will really stress new franchises and new types of games for the Gamecube launch. Remember when the SNES launched with totally new types of games like F-Zero and Pilotwings to go with Super Mario World?

<p>1080-2 is a possibility, but nothing is for certain, obviously. One thing is for sure-- 1080 on Gamecube would look simply amazing. As for affiliation, I can't really go into detail on that, as N-Sider just started up. Keep reading however, I think you'll be very pleased with the content and features we have in store for the coming weeks.</b>

<p>Hey!
 
<p>It's me again.  And I am back with some questions.
 
<p>There's been a lot of talk about Julian from Factor 5, who made incredible comments about the Gamecube and Rogue Squadron.  What do you think of these comments, especially since he suddenly denied them?
 
<p>Also, Miyamoto has made some interesting comments on RAM...What do you think on this confusing issue?
 
<p>That's all (not as many questions as before).
 
<p>Thanks,

<p>Mark Mullin

<p><b>Pete: Hmmm...I've read the "comments" you refer to. I really don't want to get too much into it, but I think whoever wrote them has either some detailed knowledge of the Gamecube chipset or it's a very elaborate hoax.

<p>As for <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/news/091300thebuzz.shtml">Miyamoto's comments</a>, 
it's always tough to decipher interviews with Japanese game designers, because things are often mistranslated or suggest something different in English. Personally, I don't expect Gamecube to have any more RAM than the current configuration, although anything is possible.</b>

<p>Apparently there are going to be 5 games from EAD at launch, some being new franchises. One of them, I think, is going to be a music game. Why? Let's look at the facts:
 
<p>1. Miyamoto has said that his favorite game is Samba de Amigo, a music game.
 
<p>2. Miyamoto has said that he does not think that these games are too expensive and said that due to the cheap cost of producing DVDs, special controllers could be made for certain types of games.
 
<p>3. The Gamecube's soundchip is apparently amazing and if a music game was made, a significant amount of the A-ram could be used for music.
 
<p>4. Miyamoto was dancing on stage during ECTS, this guy obviously likes his music!
 
<p>What do you think? I think it would be aweome to have fully orchestrated versions of Kondo's tunes from Legend of Zelda!
 
<p>Thanks!
 
<p>Tim

<p><b>Pete: Well, you certainly make a convincing case. Perhaps Yuji Naka will help Miyamoto-san on such a project (I kid, I kid). In all seriousness, I think a "music" game from NCL would be rather interesting. I would expect it to be quite different from anything on the market, provided that's the direction they're going in. 

<p>A fully orchestrated Zelda soundtrack would be a blessing from above, but I think Mr.Kondo and Mr.Miyamoto will focus on a dynamic soundtrack (ie: shifting music) instead. The Gamecube sound chip is a powerful little beast, so chances are the "dynamic" soundtrack could sound very similar to Redbook quality audio to boot.</b>

<p>Do you know if Ganondorf will return in the Zelda for Gamecube?

<p>Tommy D.

<p><b>Pete: Well the Zelda demo at Spaceworld did have Gannondorf, now didn't it? However, I think the Zelda demo was just that-- a demo. Expect the finished game to be much different. Of course Gannon will probably be involved in the next Zelda game, but whether it's specifically Gannondorf is unknown at this time.</b>

<p>Hi......first off i'd like to say that this site totally kicks ass!!!!!!!!!!! 
You guys are always updating the latest news and you post some great 
editorials.......Now on to business.....Since I don't think that any of the 
"big" sites will answer my question I was hoping you could help me......Now 
that Konami has said that they will be bringin Crash Bandicoot,Jurassic park 
3, and The Thing to the NGC......I was wondering.....where the hell is MGS???
 
<p>Konami just announced that they are making MGS:X for X-Box.......and I wanted 
to know when/if they will be making MGS for GAMECUBE???I mean why would they 
develop MGS for X-box and not the NGC.....Also if they are making MGS for 
GAMECUBE then why do you think they did'nt announce it with Crash 
Bandicoot,Jurassic Park 3 and The Thing???.... Because when they announced 
those 3 titles for X-Box they also announced MGS.....Thanx for your 
help......and next time i'll send in a shorter question


<p>Unkwown

<p><b>Pete: I received a bunch of letters like this. Where is MGS on Gamecube? I don't think Konami has full Gamecube kits (meaning the finished chipset) just yet, but they should be receiving one very soon. From there, I think you could see some kind of announcement. If MGSX is indeed the XBox version of MGS2, it does show Konami is willing to bring the game to different platforms, and I think that would increase the chance of seeing a Gamecube version someday.</b>
