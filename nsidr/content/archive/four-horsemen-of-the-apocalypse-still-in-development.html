<p>The 3DO action title <i>Four Horsemen of The Apocalypse</i> has been given a new home under newly created Four Horsemen Entertainment, according to IGN.com.</p>

<p>Four Horsemen Entertainment employs many of the same people who worked on the title under the now bankrupt 3DO company.  Michael Mendheim, the original director and creator of the game, has founded Four Horsemen Entertainment to create an entire line of Four Horseman products including comic books, graphic novels and of course a video game.</p>  

<blockquote><p><font size="2">"The Four Horsemen concept is cool because it is based on the most popular book in history, the Bible," Mendheim said. "Our fear factor isn't about zombies walking around. It's about plagues and torment. It's scary because of the realism. Everyday, people see and read about miracles happening, plagues, the devastation of famine or even a statue bleeding. Our concept is scary, because it just might be true."</font></p></blockquote>
