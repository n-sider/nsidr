<p>Kotaku has posted an interview Neal Mueller, the individual who climbed Mt. Everest with a backpack full of electronics.  Mr. Mueller made it to the summit of the mountain on June 2.  Check out the full interview <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/oddities/ds-survives-everest-expedition-update-107779.php">here</a>.  An excerpt is below:</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Q: Howd the Nintendo DS withstand the high altitudes?</b><br><br>

<b>Mueller</b>: We totally had so much electronic equipment, and Id say the Nintendo DS held up the best of any of it We were using a CB radio to stay in touch and that would consistently go bad then wed bring it back to life It was because of the wind and the cold, we had a Dell computer that got fried, a Polytechnic screen that went out we had three of the four MP3 players go bad.but the Nintendo DS units keep hanging in there And it was the Nintendo DS units that suffered the worst of it - they were constantly with us in our tents which were moist and cold the were right there in our packs so they suffered a lot of wind blasts, they were dropped And the Sherpas would beat the (heck) out of them - theyd play with them in the kitchen where curry would get split on them, all these incredibly hot spices and they kept on performing Believe me, if they went through the stuff that they went through (making the way up to Everest), I can guarantee a five-year-old can spill jelly on them and theyll still survive (vs. PSP)
