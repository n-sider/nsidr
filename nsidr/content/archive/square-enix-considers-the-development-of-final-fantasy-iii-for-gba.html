<p>A Square Enix producer Takashi Tokita told Japanese publications Dengeki and Nintendo Dream, that while the company is currently developing <i>Final Fantasy I & II</i> for the Game Boy Advance, it is also considering bringing <i>Final Fantasy III</i> (the third Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo Famicom) to the handheld.</p>

<p>"We have not completely sealed away Final Fantasy III," he said. "It's just that we missed out on the right moment to release it."

<p>He said that Nintendo has been very supportive of the development of <i>Final Fantasy I & II</i> for the Game Boy Advance.  Square Enix considered the option of releasing the titles as a part of Nintendo's Famicom Mini series but has instead opted to release them to stand on their own in a combo package.</p>

<p><i>Final Fantasy I & II</i> is tentatively scheduled for release in Japan this summer.  A North American release has not yet been announced.</p>
