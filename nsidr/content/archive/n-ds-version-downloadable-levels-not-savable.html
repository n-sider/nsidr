Fans of the PC flash game <i>N</i> have been looking forward to portable play in the form of <i>N+</i>, under development by Silverbirch Studios for release on Nintendo DS and Sony's PlayStation Portable.  While the title has been confirmed to have a built-in level editor, a <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3161840">new preview</a> at 1UP reveals a troubling weakness.<br />
<br />
Nintendo DS owners, it seems, will not be able to save any of the levels they download from either other players over local wireless or from an online database of player-created levels&mdash;a weakness the PSP version does not share.  It seems the game will store downloaded levels in a limited number of slots in RAM, and lose those levels when the system is turned off.  The preview doesn't say whether this weakness applies to levels the player has created himself.<br />
<br />
N+ is still on-track for a Q4 release.
