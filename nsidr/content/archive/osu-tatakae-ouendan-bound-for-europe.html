<p>Jeuxvideo reports on some <a href="http://www.jeuxvideo.fr/oendan-arrive-en-europe-actu-32112.html">interesting comments from Nintendo UK execs</a> indicating that import favorite <i>Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan</i> may well be headed for publication in Europe.</p>

<p>The title is extremely Japanese; the song list consists entirely of Japanese hits and the mangas, while extremely funny to the otaku set, are also steeped deeply into Japanese culture.  A localization of the title might still retain these elements, but it seems more likely we would see <i>Ouendan</i> remade with European songs and predicaments.  We'll see what comes of this, if anything.</p>
