<p>After, as Earthbound/Mother fansite bar none Starmen.net says, ten years, <i>Mother 3</i> <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=msg&th=19941">has been dated in Japan</a> by series creator <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=864">Shigesato Itoi</a>.  The date: April 20, 2006.</p>

<p><i>Mother 3</i> has been in the works for quite some time, most famously appearing in 1999 at Spaceworld <a href="http://n-sider.com/gameview.php?gameid=403">for the Nintendo 64</a>.  No plans to release any games from the series (known as <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=85"><i>Earthbound</i></a> stateside) have yet been announced outside Japan.</p>
