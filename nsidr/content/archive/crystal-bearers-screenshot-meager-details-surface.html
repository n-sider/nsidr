From among the many Japanese magazine scans making their way around the <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/">NeoGAF Forums</a> comes our <a href="http://img149.imagevenue.com/img.php?image="https://static.nsidr.com/04560_FFCC2_122_1012lo.jpg">first glance</a> at <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers</i>.<br />

According to <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3159538">an interview</a> at 1UP with Crystal Bearers director Toshiyuki Itahana, the character has "a world-weary weather-beaten image, my image was not to design a hero with curly hair, but to make it appear a little disheveled because it's supposed to be a little messy so that it appears that he's been through a lot of stuff and wanted to convey a rugged look for the hero. I want to write an exhilarating tale of this great hero set against sweeping blue skies, who has in his past gone around adventuring, so that's what I had in mind."  This particular character appears to start the game as a hero of sorts, opposing the usual RPG tradition of starting out weak and growing more powerful.<br />
<br />
Itahana also told 1UP that Crystal Bearers is much more focussed on the single-player experience.  Mitsuru Kamiyama, director of upcoming Nintendo DS title <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</i> also dropped a little bit of information about the portable title: <i>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</i>' moogle painting is making an appearance.<br />
<br />
Ring of Fates will appear on Japanese shelves August 23.  Crystal Bearers' release is still TBA.
