<h3>[11.03] V - Highly Refined Pirates</h3><P>You guys must be really fond of Cheez Whiz because I got ten freaking letters in one week, and considering this is only the third REAL installment of this column, that means this column is fairly damned monumental.  At least to me.  What it also means though, is that there's a good amount of typing and reading gonna be going on over in my proverbial neck of the woods.  That's great though.  Great great great.

<P>Quaint asides at the tops of letters columns are still all the rage last time I checked, so might I say that it was terribly gloomy and raining here today but I wasn't overly concerned.  I went to my film class this evening and we watched <I>My Life to Live</i> and <I>Breathless</i>, a couple of great French ones, and then on the way out I hit up the hot beverage machine and went to pick the French Vanilla, in the spirit of the day.  What I've concluded is this:

<P>There are at least three different types of "French Vanilla" stuff.  The first is the ice cream flavor, which sometimes says French Vanilla but is never actually given to me when I ask for it and in its place is substituted regular vanilla.  There is French Vanilla cappuccino, the good, genuine stuff -- vanilla flavored coffee with the milky top, and the finally there is just "French Vanilla," the beverage they have in the hot beverage machine.  This isn't vanilla flavored coffee, it's vanilla coffee flavored water.  It has a certain allure that makes me appreciate the vast expanses of muddy grass and crystal clear birds flying briskly through my visibly brisk breath on the so-calledly piercing blue sky during the five-o'-clock overcast and drizzling twilight.  It's still only coffee flavored water, though.

<P>I don't know if I'm feeling adequately sardonic enough to rip into you guys today!  What was the topic again?  Oh yes, reality in video games.  I got some wildly varied responses so there's no real order here.  Stick around for the ride, cause there's a treat at the end.  And if you scroll to the bottom to see it, I'll firebomb your car.  Or bicycle.  Or feet.

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Please, take the Cheese Wizz. Take it all, so that the innocent can be spared! 



<P>Oh, realism in gaming is the topic, not your infernal artificial "dairy" products? If you insist. Just stop poking me with sticks. 



<P>Roleplay/immersion is one of the main ways that a person can derive enjoyment from a game. Additionally, some serious-minded people have a very low tolerance for suspending belief. Thus, there is a large group of people for whom fantasy is verboten. It's not like this is their fault, or that their view is invalid. Just different. I'm basing all this off of a <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~PersonalityInstitute/Myers-BriggsTypeIndicator.htm" target="_blank">widely-used</a> psychological theory, by the way. This did not emerge from a region proximate to my colon. 



<P>However, even though it's natural, I suspect that this is the same mindset that worries about the effect that violence in games has on behavior and the perception of norms. The roleplay-reality aspect is judged as being that powerful. Further, if the statistics are correct about this group, then there are many more of them then those who embrace fantasy, so that the eventual trend in games could be increasingly towards the realistic. 



<P>To give a comparison with the movie industry, how many blockbusters mess with metaphysics? Notice that the Matrix and Lord of the Rings are valuable to the fantasy-minded not only because they're generally done well, but also because they're relatively rare. What, you think Lotr is mainstream? A friend of mine in beauty school was just recently classified as "the nerd" because she mentioned an affection for those silly Hobbits. 



<P>So to sum up, the realistically-minded shouldn't be ridiculed or shunned for being what they naturally are. However, because of their numbers, their economic power as a group could have an increasingly adverse effect on the rest of us. 



<P>Lastly, please name 3 or 4 concrete nouns that you hate. Like say onions, plastic bottles, or Alf. And not like Communism, running, or omnipotence.

<b>Long-Winded Brandon says:</b> <P>I'll agree with your statement that the realistically-minded shouldn't be ridiculed.  I'll admit I was a little harsh on that guy last week.  The fact of the matter is that I couldn't beat the freaking shark dude and Joe's slow ass kept getting bit.

<P>Actually that's not entirely true and I just fabricated it so I'd have a somewhat enjoyable fictional excuse for why I was pissy.

<P>Your FWIAGBNAGF in beauty school -- unless, that is, she is your FWIAGAAGF in beauty school -- is probably among the minority because we're dealing with beauty school.  LOTR's in the mainstream as far as fantasy goes, but most of the time, modern fantasy is so cleverly disguised as a "quaint British comedy starring Hugh Grant" that the teeming masses can't help but see it.

<P>I really hope games don't go too far towards the realistic, but it's obvious that it's already happening.  Twenty years ago or whatever, a little yellow puck-man eating "power pellets" and chomping down on ghosts in a neon cage was considered normal.  Now we've got, as people pointed out, a real-freaking-life <I>Survivor</I> video game, a fictional example I threw out last week just to see over the top.  Looks like I can't put anything past you guys.

<P>This response is hardly coherent.

<P>Oh wait, four nouns I hate.  Uh.... worm, Earth, Japanimation, and impotence.  I mean omnipotence.  No wait Communism.  Running.  Alf.  Onions.  Communist Alf Running with Onions and Worms on planet Earth.  In Japanimation.  While Omnipotently Impotent.

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Hi, it is me again, the one who wrote the letter you "hated" last week. It is not your fault, I guess I didn't explain what I was arguing about clearly.

<P>You see, a topic about using viewtiful powers in real life is something a kindergarden teacher would ask her students one day during class. 

<P>Maybe the letter sounded as if I hate fantasy games and I am a hardcore simulator gamer, but please, do not get me wrong. 

<P>I was just bashing solely on the TOPIC being discussed, and wanted to help out by bringing up several other ones.

<P>Topics on the state of the gaming industry, recreating of genres, marketing, third parties, the next generation of gaming, and of course, the rising war on the handheld market are topics that I feel are worth discussing. 

<P>I LOVED Viewtiful Joe and many other fantasy games along with the more realistic games. In fact, after looking at my library of games, the ratio of fantasy games to reality games are 5:1 respectably.

<P>The only reason I brought up those topics about 'reality' is because that seems to be the popular thing these days and I thought it would have been an interesting topic to talk about if they would be any good ideas for the gaming industry. AND THAT'S IT. I should tell you that I sincerely HATE all of the reality shows on TV. I think it is disgusting what has been going on in the TV industry and maybe that's the reason for watching so little TV these days (as i stated in my previous letter). For the love of God, give the writers their jobs back.

<P>I'm sorry for any confusion that I have brought up, and I'm looking foward to the heavily anitcipated N-Universe.

<b>Mister Brandon I Had A Assident says:</b> <P>Any Kindergarten teacher who asks their students how they'd use Viewtiful powers is neat, in my opinion.  Maybe I'm neglecting my true calling.  Brandon, Kindergarten Teacher.

<P>Apology accepted, even though you tried to get some counter-points in there.  Yes, more realistic THERE'S THAT WORD AGAIN topics could be discussed, but I'm trying not to irreparably bore everyone who visits.  We'll do some tongue-in-cheek serious stuff now and again, and even deliberate over whether the N5's processor will be one or two megahertz faster than value X some day, but for now we're keeping it non-banal and enjoyable.

<P>N-Universe is coming.  Some time.  It's probably not as N-Definite as all that but I'm just the Heart Containers guy.  So.  N-Fuhgetaboutit.

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>I absolutley agree with videogames being about 'escaping from reality'! It's one of the ...uh...How many? 3? Big simple reasons video games are good for people.  Escaping from reality to vent your anger , dexterity increation, fun passtime.

<P>Anyway, it can really help kids, or anyone, escape from the real world and experience life as someone/something else. perhaps taking anger out their anger, if their is any on another character. Fighting games are good for that, or at least they used to be... I'm not sure how these newfangled ones work so much anymore....

<P>So, Would I like to see a Reality Show Sim? Didn't they make a survivor game? Didn't it score low?

And I'm sure any sort of Joe Millionaire :[insert lowly proffesion expansion here] would do extremley poorly as well. Think about it. That genre could not, would not do well.

<P>As for Virtual Dr. Quirmbach's math textbook, it might do well in a math class situtation.... theoretically...

The perfect genre, I think, includes 2-d platforming action with powerups galore. A cross between super Metroid and Mario... :O

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>The validity of video games as a source of entertainment and escape.?  Well thats all video games are entertainment and escape just as most other forms of entertainment, like movies, books and such. Games can be fun yet informative, age of empires sure taught me alot. I didn't even realized i was learning stuff until i knew about all these dead historical people my history teacher was talkiing about, she prounounced the name wrong too had to correct her ha. math games in any form imaginable cannot possible be fun, unless u love math. Video games should definetley not become to real, we already have books and movies giving sycophants cool ideas ha ha ha

<P>stick to the current formula of video games, make it as fun as possible, realism not as important as that.

<P>Number Munchers was one of the greatest games ever created and it dealt solely with math.  I loved that damned game.  Until it got to the prime numbers stage and I was hosed cause I didn't know prime numbers in first grade or whatever.

<P>I loved suddenly knowing something because I saw it in an RPG.  After all, I learned everything I know about religion from Xenogears!  OMG TEH STREATS WIL FLOW WITH TEH BLOD OF TEH NON_BELIVEFRS ALL HAIL CHUCHU

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Haven't we already seen reality games?  There are like 4 Survivor PC games!  They aren't very fun, but in terms of an actual reality genre of game, isn't that like Animal Crossing?  The Sims?  I mean, how much more like real life do you want to get than The Sims?  Any more real life, and I might as well just interact with real people in real life...  And do these reality games require realistic graphics?  Does that mean we'll have to wait 10 years before we get a good Game Boy version of a reality game?  

<P>Personally, I think what Tommy D really wants is a new Earthbound game.  Like, a modern-day, mostly realistic setting, in an RPG with nothing to do with the renaissance or Welsh mythology or wars.  Maybe what we are all thinking when we say "RPGs aren't realistic enough" is "I want Mother 4 on Cube, dammit!"

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>I understand where you are coming from when you say that 

video games are an escape from reality. However, I foresee 

the day when reality and video games will complement each 

other. The big thing for video games next generation will be 

online play. But what will the next big thing be? Virtual 

Reality. The military is already being trained with virtual 

reality utilities. I'm certain that that technology will 

eventually be utilized in the priveleged American's 

household. Then as it gets cheaper, virtual reality will 

become common-place. You may see that as a vague prediction, 

but I think that is the way the world is leaning towards. 

Some people may argue that today's games are a primitive form 

of virtual reality (figuratively speaking). When playing Wind 

Waker, I would get so into the adventure, that I would 

literally lose myself in gameplay experience. I'm sure many 

gamers get like that, where they actually become Link (or 

Mario, Solid Snake, etc.) So while you say gaming is escaping 

reality. I see it more like entering a psuedo reality: 

essentially another dimension on another plane. "True" 

virtual reality will be the next step. And let's not kid 

ourselves, virtual reality will be the next big think after 

online gaming becomes mainstream. Perhaps that is when you 

can finally get your hands on that survivor virtual reality 

unit that you seem so fond of:)

<b>Brandon says:</b> <P>Hell yes they're already hand in hand in that you <i>simulate</i> reality through your fictional videogame, which is what my opinion's been the whole time.  No really.

<P>In a literal sense of "goggles on your head check this out no wait you can't because the goggles are on my head" sort of VR, I'm gonna have to disagree that it will become mainstream any time soon.  Until a higher-immersion home electronic system is convenient and affordable, I think all we'll see is a gradual upgrade to high definition high resolution high everything television.

<P>I read in the paper that the United States is switching from analog to digital broadcasts in 2006.  That's exciting to me, and is also relatively off-topic.

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Im not a regular reader of Heart Containers so I dont know what topics have been discussed or not, but it appears your really down on ideas. Why dont you discuss the cameo appearances of video game characters outside their own games. Its somewhat a current thing.. look at the rumours of sonic and the possibilites of him appearing in Mario Kart Double Dash. You can discuss things such as Link's appearance in Soul Calibur 2, the Sonic decals in F-Zero GX and Sonic in Billy Hatcher. Plus you can start remembering all your old favourite games with cameos of their own. All the road side signs in Stunt Race FX, Oracina of Time's pictures when you first see Zelda and the necklaces at Lon Lon Rance, even games like Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 and 3 with the comic book characters (Spider-Man and Wolverine). There is alot to talk about and with the current trend it may be quite possible that Sonic and Tails may be in Mario Kart. Just imagine what might come to pass: Mario and Luigi VS! Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong VS Sonic and Tails in a three kart race. It sounds very attractive. 

<P>Anyway, use my topic for discussion of you want. I wouldnt mind reading it you chose it. Personally I like cameos, so long as the presence of the character isnt overwhelming. Soul Calibur is a nice example.

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Yo yo, anyways I would like to comment on the game Too Human. Now I have to say this game is going to be sweet whenever it comes out, but recentley I have been thinking, why isn't there any news on this game.... hmmm... interesting. Could it be possible that the grand scope of this game couldn't be fully achieved on the Gamecube... now its getting interesting. My thoughts are with Silicon Knights now taking up other projects and working on them (MGS: TTS) that maybe they have pushed this one back for the N5. I mean think about it how could you get a better launch game to showcase your new platform, then a futuristic game with gourgeous graphics and an intense story. I don't know about you but it seems like the perfect fit too me. In the words of Frank Ricard "I see the N5... and it looks glorious!"

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>OK for one, the game should of been called Viewtiful Joedi, Capcom was close, but they missed the boat. Hell I wouldve even settled for Viewtiful JoeD or Viewtiful JD. Hey Im a guy with a girl name, cut me some slack if im trying to make it more manly.

<P>Prior to me hearing about Viewtiful Joe, MegaMan was my favorite game mascot, but since Capcom decided to release a bunch of crappy X games over the Good Original Series (child of the 80s) I have decided that Mach Speed and Zoom definatly beats Rush Jet and Needle Cannon any day ( but I did enjoy Hulk Davidsons mention of "MegaMan"). 

<P>I had my doubts upon pre-ordering this game (back in May) but once I played the demo I knew it was gonna be a sweet game. So when I went to pick up the game I was given A Viewtiful Joe shirt and a Viewtiful Joe Limited Edition Lazer Cell (number 0911). Now this surpirsed me. I was expecting just a game, i wasnt expecting 2 bonus gifts from the guys at Capcom. Not even Nintendo through in a free T-shirt when I pre-ordered that Wind Waker train wreck ( fan of the graphics, not a fan of the boating (BORING)). 

<P>Anyways V.Joe is gonna end up being either a Viewtiful game no one will bother to play or a Viewtiful game that everyone will get for Christamas. And another thing, why is Alistor so damn awesome, him and Hulk Davidson have to be the coolest bosses from any Capcom game; Tyrant who, Dr Wily HUH. 

<P>Well yeah thats all I have to say, play this game or you will get the X-Buster in your ass, as for me Im off to go to Electronic Boutique and pick up my V.Joe Poster and Cardboard cutout.

<P>What are your favorite "nostalgia" games?  Games you loved hardcore back in the day but probably wouldn't be as amused with today.  Tell me what they were and why, or else I'll take all the Cheez Whiz I got and I'll eat it all and then throw the jars at you.

<P>I said there'd be a treat at the end of the column didn't I?

<P>Uhhhh.... go <a href="http://www.zombo.com" target="_blank">here</a> and wait for about seven minutes, then your treat will send itself to fifty of your friends and Microsoft will give you 738.39$ for forwarding this or you'll have bad luck and never get sex.  I think that's what it said.  But I didn't click the link.

<P>I guess that means I'm screwed.  Or rather that I'm not.  Huh.

<P>Send me your letters or I'll die!  No, really!  Well I'll die anyway but still send them.  kthxbye</TD>
