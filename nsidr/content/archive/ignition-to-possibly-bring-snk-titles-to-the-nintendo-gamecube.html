<p>Ignition Entertainment might port and/or develop SNK games for the Nintendo GameCube, according to SNK Neo Geo USA Consumer Corporation president Ben Herman.  As discovered by InsertCredit.com, Celsius from the mmcafe forums spoke with Herman over the telephone to discuss this issue.</p>

<p>Herman told him that if any SNK games were to come out for the GameCube, they would be ported or developed by Ignition Entertainment and not SNK. Ignition Entertainment recently signed a contract with SNK Playmore to be the official publisher and localization studio of SNKs console titles in Europe.  As a result, the GameCube titles, if one is created, would be released in Europe first, followed by a release in North America. The North American GameCube release, while developed by Ignition, would be published by SNK USA.</p>
