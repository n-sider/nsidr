Sega and BioWare are teaming up to bring an RPG based on Sonic the Hedgehog to the Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
While no gameplay details are known, much less the title of the game, BioWare is a recognized developer of roleplaying games. Some of their hits include <i>Baldur's Gate</i>, <i>Neverwinter Nights</i>, <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i>, and <i>Jade Empire</i>. Ray Muzyka, CEO of BioWare, said, "As huge fans of Sonic ourselves, we're committed to delivering a truly amazing story-driven experience within the Sonic universe, focusing on capturing the character's broad appeal and placing him in a completely original adventure."<br />
<br />
Simon Jeffery, President and COO of Sega of America, added, "BioWare is one of the hottest names in RPG development in the world. Everyone at SEGA has huge confidence that Sonic is in the safest of hands, and that BioWare can create the ultimate handheld RPG experience for gamers of all ages."<br />
<br />
The announcement makes the latest Sonic game the third for the DS, coming after <i>Sonic Rush</i> and the upcoming </i>Sonic Rush Adventure</i> this fall. The game will ship sometime in 2008.
