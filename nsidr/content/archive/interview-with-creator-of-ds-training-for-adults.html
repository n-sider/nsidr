<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Q:</b> How did the development first occur to make DS Training for Adults? Was it a "eureka!" moment or did Nintendo first approach you to develop the game, or something
different altogether?<br><br>

<b>A:</b> Nintendo has approached me. I have been introducing our research activities towards industries in Japan. I have been suggesting that, using brain imaging techniques, companies would be able to know how their products
effect on human brain. Then Nintendo wishes to create videogames that can activate human prefrontal cortex.</font></blockquote>
