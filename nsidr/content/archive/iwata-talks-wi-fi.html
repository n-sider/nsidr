<p><a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>  has comments from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> at TGS revealing some new information about the upcoming Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection:</p>

<ul><li>Iwata reaffirmed that the titles will be playable for no cost beyond the Internet connection and the cost of the game, the intent being "all consumers who purchase a Wi-Fi enabled game will try Wi-Fi connection at least once".</li>

<li>A Nintendo-branded USB Wi-Fi access point, presumably a device that will share your PC's Internet connection with DS (and possibly Revolution) systems, will appear on shelves alongside the first Wi-Fi titles.  UK online retailer Play says this adapter's suggested retail price is GBP 19.99.</li>

<li>Unfortunately, at least for the time being, voice chat will not be supported for upcoming titles; Nintendo Europe has claimed the need to avoid "untoward activity."</li></ul>
