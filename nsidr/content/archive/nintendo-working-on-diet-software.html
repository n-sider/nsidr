<p>A Bloomberg report IGN Wii has <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/725/725652p1.html">picked up on</a> claims Nintendo is working on diet software for its upcoming home console, Wii.</p>

<p>The mention is light on details, but Bloomberg reportedly said, while commenting on recent strong performance of Nintendo stock, that the company is hard at work on diet and mysterious "other" software for Wii.  (It should be noted that any aerobics title, currently making the Internet rounds, appears to be pure fan speculation at this time&mdash;though it's certainly something Nintendo could do.)</p>

<p>Regardless of the status of any of this software, Nintendo has formally announced none of it.  Just like the demos shown at E3, some may find their way into future software, but until Nintendo makes that announcement, there's no guarantee you'll actually be able to buy it.</p>
