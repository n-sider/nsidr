Admittedly I'm jealous of you guys and gals who've paid off your mortgage.  With those house payments out of the way, you no doubt have some disposable income that allows you to hit the town like Paris Hilton and buy the most stylish shoes on the block.    Massage chair?  Wide-screen television?  Or how about a replica of the master sword seen in the Legend of Zelda?  If you're looking for any of these items or more, <a href="http://nookbay.com/">NookBay</a> is the place to start.  Bid on items that are placed up for auction by other users.  It's an opportunity to find your most treasured item or simply a good deal.
