Famitsu has released <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2007/06/06/104,1181134713,72965,0,0.html">details and screenshots</a> on a new fishing game for Wii. <i>Six-O Legend</i> isn't the first fishing game for Wii, but it will be the first online fishing game. Bass Fishing Wii is being developed by Sims, the team behind the Dreamcast game <i>Sega Bass Fishing</i> which worked with the Dreamcast fishing rod peripheral. You can check out Sims' unusual game mascot for the title at <a href="http://www.arcsystemworks.jp/60/">the official website</a>.<br />
<br />
The game will include six locations for bass fishing, including the Grand Canyon and Crater Lake in North America, among others. The different levels include changing seasons, weather, and time of day. There will be various gameplay modes available, such as time attack and, as previously mentioned, online. No specific details have been released regarding the online mode.<br />
<br />
Bass Fishing Wii is currently set for a release later this year in Japan, but there is no word yet on a North American release.
