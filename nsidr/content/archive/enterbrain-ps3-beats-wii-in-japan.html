For a long while, it was unthinkable, but with Wii's lukewarm popularity in Nintendo's home country of Japan in recent weeks&#8212;even as it continued to sell out in North America&#8212;magazine publisher Enterbrain has noted Sony's PlayStation 3 pulling ahead for the first time since its launch.<br />
<br />
According to the publisher, in the four week period ending November 25, PS3 sold 183,217 units versus Wii's 159,193.  The news comes on the heels of <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>'s lackluster performance in Nintendo's home country, where it tracked below previous series entry <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, which was released for the then-waning GameCube.<br />
<br />
Analyst Hiroshi Kamide told Reuters he isn't sure the news is an indication of a sea change in the market.  "Overseas, I don't really see the PS3 doing that much at Christmas time primarily because it's still more expensive than the other machines and has less software.<br />
<br />
"It's nice to see the system selling much better than six months ago. But is it a sustainable trend? Is it going to really escalate from here? I'm not so sure."<br />
<br />
Japan-watchers are pinning Wii's hopes on the release of Nintendo E3 focal point <i>Wii Fit</i>, an exercise and fitness title that comes with a special balance/weight sensing peripheral and launches tomorrow.<br />
