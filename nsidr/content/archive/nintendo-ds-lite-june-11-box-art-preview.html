<p>Nintendo of America has revealed the packaging for the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a>, a sleek redesign of its DS handheld that is scheduled to appear on store shelves June 11 for a retail price of $129.99.  The box is a simple but elegant design displaying the Nintendo DS logo and two-thirds of a sterling-white Nintendo DS Lite handheld.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo Europe announced its <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2182">plans to launch</a> the DS Lite across Europe. The system will sell for Â£99.99 in the UK and â‚¬149.99 elsewhere on June 23.  The DS Lite released in Japan <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1819">back in March</a>.  Supply was limited due to manufacturing difficulties and high demand.  The procrastinated worldwide release of the handheld has been attributed to the nearly three months needed for Nintendo to catch up with the remarkable demand in Japan.  There were reports of lines outside stores of several thousand long.  Since its launch in March, the DS Lite has been selling between 100,000-200,000 units each week.  Altogether, the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> has sold 16 million units worldwide since its debut in November 2004.</p>
