Kicking off Nintendo's media summit in Seattle, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/05/nintendo_media_.html">discussed Nintendo's success</a> and how it is influencing the video game market.<br />
<br />
According to Wired, Reggie noted that female game purchasers are up by 42%. Also, older gamers are becoming more common, with DS owners over 30 going up 127%, and those over 35 up 212%.<br />
<br />
Along with Nintendo's focus on exploring new audiences, Reggie noted that more third-party titles are being sold on Wii than Nintendo-published ones, a problem which turned off many publishers from Gamecube. This time around, Reggie says, third-party developers are "moving enthusiastically towards Wii."<br />
<br />
Nintendo's media summit will continue through today and into tomorrow.
