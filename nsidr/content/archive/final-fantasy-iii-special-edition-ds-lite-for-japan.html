<p>The bundle, which will retail for 22,780 yen, will go on sale in that territory when the game releases August 24.  No date has yet been set for Final Fantasy III's release outside Japan, but Nintendo is definitely expected to publish the title in America at some point.  The game's publication in America would mark the first time it has been available in any format or on any system outside Japan.</p>
