DSiWare has turned out to be something really quite special, if you take the time to look and see what it offers.  This week, I almost didn't&mdash;to be frank, I skimmed the release list&mdash;and I almost missed out on the almost overbearingly charming <i>Lemmings</i>-ish <i>DodoGo!</i><br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6546&view=screens&imgid=1"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-4024-1.jpg" width="170" height="255" class="image_styled" /></a></div>Quick synopsis: you need to get a handful of positively adorable dodo eggs through each of the game's many, many levels and into the nest.  You can command them to go left, right or stop with swipes of the stylus.  These guys are about as animated as they come; they typically roll smilingly along, but can also get pissed off complete with hilarious sound effects if you, say, dunk them in the water.  They also get super-happy if they're having fun&mdash;bouncing on springs or flying through the air off jump ramps are good ways to achieve this.  They interact, too; super-happy eggs will tell jokes to nearby unhappy ones and cheer them up, and if an egg happens to be looking when another one hits the ground hard and breaks, he'll freak out and roll away uncontrollably.  This isn't all for show, either; you want them all to be super-happy to get the best ranking.<br />
<br />
Getting them there is done not just through stop and go commands, but also with an arsenal of tools that you place and use throughout the level.  I've only been through the first two worlds, but already I've been introduced to aim-able springs, "decks" (ramps and floors used to bridge gaps and slow falling eggs), brushes to kick up dust or set wood aflame, and a mind-numbingly cute little crash-test-dummy egg I can use for test runs to avoid breaking one of the live ones.  ("Robo-egg," as they call him, also has his own bonus levels where you need to set up the arena to carry him from start to finish and hit all the targets along the way&mdash;very cool additions.)<br />
<br />
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this game just oozes polish, too.  It could have easily been a retail release, if the DS retail market wasn't so harsh these days.  It's got <i>really</i> good art, animation, and sound.  I have but one complaint, and that's been that in the two worlds I've been through thus far, it's been pretty easy to get the gold cups.  But it's a fairly sizable-looking game and I've had at least one or two minor head-scratchers, so there's potential yet&mdash;and even if it isn't all that hard, it's still great fun.  From what I've played so far, I can safely recommend you take a look at <i>DodoGo!</i>
