<p>Polygon Mag has reported that Nintendo is planning to partner with MegaHouse Corporation in order to release series of music complilations based on classic NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) games. Oddly enough, the CDs will each measure only eight centimeters in diameter, nearly the same size as a GameCube disc. The company plans on releasing compilations for twenty classic NES games such as <i>Ice Climber</i>, <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, and <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>. 

<p>Interestingly, each of the compilations will only cost around 300 yen (roughly $3.00 U.S.) and hit shelves this April. It is unknown whether or not a release outside of Japan is planned or will ever take place.
