<p>Nintendo and <a href="http://media.freescale.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=196520&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=854299&highlight=">Freescale Semiconductor</a> announced the CodeWarrior development environment as the official toolset for Nintendo's forthcoming Wii console. Freescale's Radix technology powers the CodeWarrior tools chosen by Nintendo.  It will offer a "lightweight C++ framework with flexible, modular architecture designed for maximum extensibility."</p>

<p>"Freescale's CodeWarrior technology has earned a worldwide reputation for offering high-quality development tools," said <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a>, senior managing director and general manager, Integrated Research & Development Division for Nintendo Co., Ltd. "The tools selected for Wii are no exception, and will allow game developers to create exciting titles that take advantage of the unique features found in our new platform."</p>

<p>You may recall that Nintendo and Freescale <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1858">teamed up in March</a> to bring GameCube development kits to North American University students.</p>
