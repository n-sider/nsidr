<p>The rumor mill has been cranking for some time with the possibility that Nintendo would be announcing a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> SP, as it were, this coming Monday.  The rumor started with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1635">apologies for Japanese shortages</a> of the system, but the fans were flamed particularly high when importer Lik-Sang claimed there was announcement coming down the pipe this Monday.</p>

<p><a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/681/681200p1.html">Speaking to IGN</a> this morning, however, Nintendo of America has this to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Clearly, Nintendo DS continues to be one of the most popular and talked-about video game systems available.</p>

<p>Through 2005, some 13 million units have sold worldwide. Nintendo is always looking for ways to improve its games and systems, but we have nothing to announce at this time.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's effectively a given that the immensely popular yet oft-panned-for-bulkiness DS will see a redesign at some point in its life, and perhaps even this year.  However, that point does not appear to be right now.</p>
