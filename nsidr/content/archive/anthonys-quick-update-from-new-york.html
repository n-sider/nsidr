<p>N-Sider's intrepid Anthony JC has returned from Nintendo's media event in New York bearing gifts in the form of news tidbits.  Look for his full in-depth recount of the event very soon.  In the meantime, peruse the bullets for some cool details.</p>

<p><ul><font size="5"><b>News</b></font>
<li>In <b>Super Mario Galaxy</b>, when you <b>get a coin</b>, you will <b>hear it on</b> the <b>remote</b>. The <b>stars</b> play a huge part in this game and are completely <b>travel-related</b> -- catapults, intergalactic vines and warp zones.  The game contains <b>lots of puzzles and platforming</b>.<br><br>

<li><b>Reggie</b> was <b>overheard mentioning first-party accessories</b> including a Wiimote pouch to carry the Wiimote around, Wii game holders, and additional grip option accessories for the Wiimote.<br><br>

<li>Wii Music, Wii Aerobics, Forever Blue, Necro Nesia, Super Paper Mario, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Donkey Kong Bongo Jet Blast, Fire Emblem, were all <b>Nintendo titles that were no shows</b> and no answers were entertained from reps.<br><br>

<li><b>EA</b> was a big <b>no show</b>. Only <b>Madden NFL '07</b> was at the show.<br><br>

<li><b>Trauma Center</b> Second Opinion didn't feel very original. Outside new medical instruments and an <b>upgrade in presentation and graphics</b>, it really is just a <b>port</b>.<br><br>

<li><b>Metroid Prime 3</b> Corruption <b>graphics</b> seem very <b>much improved</b> in the texture department (still not as good as Wii Sports, ironically). The voice acting and cinematic direction is very well done. Very epic.<br><br>

<li>Ubisoft (many UBI designers were actually present) was very protective over <b>Red Steel</b>. They did not allow us to film. The game appeared to be very <b>buggy and crashed</b> several times. Not only did the game crash but the colors would act up and flash weird colors out of nowhere.  Hopefully this will be ironed out by launch.<br><br>

<li>Sega's <b>Sonic</b> and the Secret Rings controls like Excite Truck. It has similar <b>racing game controls</b>.<br><br>

<li><b>No Virtual Console games on display</b> at the event or mentioned outside of the official press release.<br><br>

<li>The all-star trio of <b>Sonic, Mario, and Zelda</b> were all presented in the form of the <b>exact demos from E3 2006</b>.<br><br>

<li><b>Excite Truck</b> looks like it has a <b>decent selection</b> of <b>vehicles</b> although the demo only allowed for three of the lot to be picked. There is a huge palette of color customization to pick for your vehicle. The game has very fun exaggerated physics that seem like a blend of Burnout, Rallisport, and Excitebike 64. Exactly, awesome combination no. The <b>soundtrack is very metal</b>. Graphics are definitely a little bit better than Rallisport 2 on Xbox for comparison. Huge draw distance, fluid framerate, lots of interesting effects like bullet time thrown in the mix.<br><br>

<li>Unfortunately with <b>Zelda</b> Wii, at this current moment, the <b>sword swings are not mapped</b>. You do a backhand to perform a sword swing but the game is not 1:1 following your swing. Hopefully this will be changed by release.<br><br>


<li><b>Big Brain Academy</b> is completely 2D but <b>looks really pretty</b> for a <b>2D game</b> unlike certain rough segments of Wario Ware. The single player was not available, only the multiplayer. Ironic that while the Nintendo DS version supports over four players, the Wii version <b>only supports two players</b>. I feel this is rather odd for this multiplayer-oriented sequel. <b>Possible Wi-Fi</b> features, although nothing is confirmed.
