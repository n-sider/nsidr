"Guilty Gear: Dust Strikers isn't just an ordinary port of a preexisting fighting game, it's an entirely new beast. Dust Strikers retains all the premiere qualities that made its home console versions stellar, and adds to that the winning formula of the Nintendo DS' exclusive stylus and dual screen gameplay format. Fans of the  Guilty Gear series will be happy to see that all their favorite characters, stages, and character specific special moves are included in this portable edition, and that Dust Strikers sports an entirely new story chapter in the Guilty Gear lineage."

"The gameplay is sloppy and basic, the characters suffer from less of an animation budget on the smaller system, and the overall feel just isn't worthy of the Guilty Gear name. There's a bit of fun to be had on the most basic of levels, but the overall strategy is far too small. Players will inevitably resort to button mashing, which is a far cry from the complexity of the Guilty Gear franchise. A similar approach is going to be taken for the PSP version, adding all new gameplay to try and win over the handheld crowd. With luck this will be a better transition, as Guilty Gear Dust Strikers isn't worth the cash."
