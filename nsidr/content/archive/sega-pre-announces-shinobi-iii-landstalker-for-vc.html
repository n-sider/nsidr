Without pinpointing a date, Sega of America announced today their plans to release two titles from the Genesis' library on Wii's Virtual Console service.  The titles are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master</i></li>
  <li><i>Landstalker</i></li>
  </ul><br />
Shinobi III has already made appearances on Japan's and Europe's Virtual Console; Landstalker, on the other hand, is entirely new to the service.  Sega notes that Genesis titles "start at" 800 Wii Points, but isn't pegging a specific price on these titles.  Of course, if experience is any guide, they will in fact land on the service at 800 Wii Points apiece.
