<p><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/705/705662p1.html">IGN.com</a> received an early glimpse and hands-on time with Activision's Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam for the Nintendo Wii.  An excerpt is below, however the full impressions can be found <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/705/705662p1.html">here</a>.</p>

"...For those that haven't had a chance to check it out, Downhill Jam essentially takes the Tony Hawk universe, and combines it with the style of SSX or 1080 Snowboarding while still keeping the feel of a traditional Hawk game in tact. Players use the Wiimote in what is known as the "classic" pose, holding it like a traditional NES controller. The A button is used to jump, B is used to pull off tricks, and the trigger underweight the D-Pad is for doing grabs. Aside from that, the character control is handled entirely by motion control..."
