US Youth Soccer has partnered with Nintendo's Pokemon franchise to celebrate Youth Soccer Month for the month of September.  A special scholarship contest called "Pokemon US Youth Soccer All-Stars" will award US Youth Soccer players for their achievements on and off the field.  US Youth Soccer members 18 and under are encouraged to enter the contest by writing a 150 word essay about times they have exhibited teamwork, sportsmanship, hard work, improved skills and other positive values in their everyday lives.

"Our partnership with US Youth Soccer makes sense on many levels, but most
importantly because we share the same core values," said Akira Chiba,
President of Pokemon USA Inc.  "We are pleased to announce a program that
identifies and rewards the accomplishments on the soccer field and in the
classroom."
