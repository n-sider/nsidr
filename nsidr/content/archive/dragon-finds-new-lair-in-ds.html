The classic laser-disc game, <i>Dragon's Lair</i>, has seen many releases and updates over the years. It first appeared in arcades in 1983, and has since made its home on many different platforms, including PC, SNES, Gameboy Color, and more recently Blu-Ray. IGN <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/799/799644p1.html">reports</a> that Dragon's Lair will now make its way to the Nintendo DS, using the newly -remastered assets seen on the high definition Blu-Ray version.<br />
<br />
The DS port of Dragon's Lair will give players many different options to control daring Dirk in his quest to save Daphne from the dragon. These options include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Single-screen play, DS held horizontally, or dual-screen play, DS held vertically</li>
  <li>D-pad, touch screen, and voice recognition support</li>
  <li>Rumble Pak support</li>
  <li>Arcade mode, as in the original arcade release, or Home mode, which adds an extra moat scene to the game</li>
  <li>Two difficulties: Easy and Hard</li>
  </ul><br />
Also available will be a visual move guide, which assists players new to the game via on-screen indicators, and Watch mode, which allows players to watch all in-game scenes as they wish, with or without deaths.<br />
<br />
Dragon's Lair DS is expected to release near the end of this year.
