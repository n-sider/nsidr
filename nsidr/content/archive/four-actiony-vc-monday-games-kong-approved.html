  <li><i>Donkey Kong Country</i> (Super NES, 1-2 players, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>The Legend of Kage</i> (NES, 1-2 players, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>New Adventure Island</i> (TG-16, 1 player, 600 Wii Points)</li>

  </ul><br />
Some excellent and quality titles this week, with DKC and Streets of Rage heading up the couple you're probably all going to get, and Kage and Adventure Island reminding you that just because they're not big well-known games doesn't mean they're not worthy of a purchase!  New Adventure Island especially.  I mean look at these graphics:<br />

Anyway, it's becoming a good time to be a Virtual Console owner!  I can hardly wait to see what exciting goodies they have in store for us next week!
