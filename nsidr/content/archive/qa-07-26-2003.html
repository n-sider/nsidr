<hr><h3>The GameSquere?</h3>
<p>
<b>
I here everyone calling Nintendo's Next Generation something like GameCube 2, GameSquere, or something like that. Those names

are all lame. What are the chances that the N5 (or whatever Nintendo's new system is code-named) will have a name like that.

Also, what are the chances that Nintendo will actually be in the (what I call) Video Game Revolution. I mean will it have

DVD/CD player and all the other stuff PS2/Xbox has. Is there any place where we can send Nintendo mail where the big people

(Presidents, Myomoto, ect) will receive it?

<p><b>Josh:</b> The next Nintendo machine will definitely, positively, without a doubt <i>not</i> be called the GameCube 2

(which is, by the way, the last current known internal codename for the machine, since the "N5" Spong rumour was not

validated the last I heard), or the GameSquare, or even anything beginning with "Game". Nintendo will likely be aiming to

stepping away from the image the GameCube has, and will not want the next system to invoke memories of the little purple box.
<p>
As far as having extras built in, it depends; if you're talking about simple DVD-playback, I really do think Nintendo will

support that this time around, provided Sony and Microsoft do. The company really wants their machine to represent more of a

direct competitor next generation, and matching that feature could help them realize that. If, on the other hand, you're

talking about TiVo-type capabilities, you can forget it. While Sony and Microsoft may envision a future where the video game

console serves as a gigantic set-top box, Nintendo wants the focus to be on games, first and foremost.

<p><b>James:</b> I agree with Josh to a certain extent here.  It's unlikely that Nintendo will use a name that invokes any thought of "GameCube" whatsoever.  I also think it's likely that Nintendo may remove its own company name from the next console's title (like having "GameCube" rather than "Nintendo GameCube".  <p>

In terms of DVD playback and things of that nature?  I doubt you'll see any of those capabilities in the GCN2.  Nintendo isn't going for a set-top box, nor is it trying to hunt down the whole home entertainment market.  Nintendo has maintained that it's in the gaming business only.  Also, I think it's likely that Nintendo will want to continue to keep sales costs as low as possible.  I can definitely see a situation where Nintendo continues to focus on being "gaming only", while Sony and Microsoft battle it out over their set-top box-like machines.  Either way, it's very hard to tell at this point.  We have virtually nothing to speculate on, in terms of raw facts.  <p>


<hr><h3>Monkey Ball crazy</h3>
<p>
<b>
THIS QUESTION IS VERY IMPORTANT! Do you know If Super Monkey Ball: Banana Crazy is still coming out.  I read a long time ago

that it was just a rumored.  I am a huge Monkey Ball Fan! Please Help Me...








 </b><br>

<i>-Christopher Groth

</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> The last I heard (I believe it was late May) the game was still slated for a release sometime in 2004. I

don't see any reason why Sega would not want to release the next Monkey Ball installment, as the series has proved relatively

profitable for them.


<hr><h3>Moving towards Xbox?</h3>
<p>
<b>
Hi n-sider Stuff!
<br>I was wondering why all the publishers were moving towards the xbox? I
mean the gamecube market is big enough, it has more then 40% older
audience and the platform is great for developpers so very cheap to
develop for, royalties are also very low, I really don't understand what
the real reason is?! What do you think? your Fan




</b><br>
<i>-Arafat Medini (Germany)
</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> The simple problem, Arafat, is that most third-party titles simply don't sell as well on the GameCube as they

do on other platforms, particularly where more "mature"-themed and sports ports are concerned. This is due to a combination

of the system having a younger demographic than the PS2 and the Xbox, as well as Nintendo gamers typically holding out more

for Nintendo's own first and second-party games. Let's face it: when you buy a GameCube, you buy it for Nintendo's franchise

titles. All of this translates into (usually, although there are a few exceptions) lower sales of third-party games on the

GameCube versus other platforms, which in turn, unfortunately, translates into some developers feeling hesitant about putting

time and money into bringing a product to a platform where it may not do very well.
<p> I would like to point out to any third-party developers reading, however, that <i>exclusive</i> quality third-party games

on the GameCube have a history of selling fairly well (Super Monkey Ball, Resident Evil, etc.) Give us more than a slip-shod

port of a PS2 or Xbox game, and your chances of good sales jump up.

<p><b>James:</b> Just to add to what Josh said; I think it's important to note that we're going to be seeing an increase in GameCube releases over the next year (compared to what we've seen thusfar) largely thanks to third party exclusives.  I wouldn't worry about any multi-platform stuff moving away from GameCube when we'll be seeing exclusives like <i>Resident Evil 4</i> and <i>Baten Kaitos</i>, as well as many others.<p>

<h3>Soul Calibur sales</h3>
<p>


<b>
Do you guys have any idea which console version of Soul Caliber 2 is
selling the best in Japan?  I would guess the Gamecube version has a
better chance of selling more than Xbox in Japan because Xbox is less
popular over there. The new EGM seems to think the Xbox version is the
best, because of its graphics and controls. Anyway having Link in my
favorite fighting game is more than enough reason for me to adjust to
the Gamecube controls, I never thought that would ever happen!





</b><br>
<i>-Allen Steele</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> The latest data puts the GameCube version well ahead of the Xbox edition, and although the PS2 game has sold

more copies, it has not done so at a super-drastic margin, as most other PS2 vs. GameCube titles have; simply put, when

talking in terms of ratio, more GameCube owners have purchased the game than PS2 owners. Of course, this is due to Link's

inclusion.


<hr>
<h3>And now a special question...</h3>
<p>


<b>
Josh,<br>
Heard anything lately on the successor to the GBA? I love you!




</b><br>
<i>-Josh</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> It's funny you should ask that, Josh -- a few of us here at N-Sider have recently heard some rumblings over

in certain European branches of Nintendo that the new Game Boy may be set to arrive sooner than many people think. Some of

Nintendo's smaller European subsidiaries have known to have incorrect information in the past, of course, but still...it does

make you think a little bit.

<p><b>James:</b> Yeah, there is some indication that Nintendo might be readying an updated Game Boy to compete directly with Sony's PSP.  But at this point, there are a lot of rumors and few hard facts.  Still, Nintendo is always working on new hardware.  It's my hope that we'll see a Game Boy announcement when we see a "GCN2" announcement (as was the case with GBA/GameCube).
