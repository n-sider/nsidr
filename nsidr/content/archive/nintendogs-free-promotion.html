Nintendo of America is holding a special promotion where certain "My Nintendo" users will receive a free copy of <i>Nintendogs</i>.  Nintendo has emailed certain users to let them know if they will be receiving a copy.  Check this <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/dogs.jsp">page</a> for more info.  For the rest of us who aren't so lucky, we can pick up <i>Nintendogs</i> when it arrives in stores on August 22.
