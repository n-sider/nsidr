<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/commentary/game_over">CNNMoney's Game Over</a> reported over the weekend that retailer <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/">Best Buy</a> is trialling the sale of used games in select markets, a practice previously the domain of specialty game stores like <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/">GameStop</a> and <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/">EB Games</a>.</p>

<p>One of the test stores is reported to have 5,000 used games available.  Credit from used game trade-ins can be used for any Best Buy merchandise.</p>

<p>Larger retailers selling used games could create a big problem for the industry concerning rising game development costs in the next generation, since while developers and publishers see no profit on used game sales, retailers generally enjoy a much higher margin than they do with new game sales.</p>
