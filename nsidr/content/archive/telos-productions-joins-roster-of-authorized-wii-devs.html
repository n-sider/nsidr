Prince Edward Island, in Canada, has a new Nintendo-authorized developer: former television production house <a href="http://www.telosentertainment.com/">Telos Productions</a>.<br />
<br />
According to Telos president Sean Yeomans, who graciously agreed to tell us a little more about his company after we discovered a brief mention of Telos' new status, the 13-strong start-up has been into game development for two years, prototyping in the interests of building staff and a track record.  Currently, Telos is delivering a GPS-based location title called <i>SpiritWorld</i>, prototyping an internet-based social MMOG called <i>The City of Sinners and Saints</i> with Multiverse, and starting production on a third-person PC shooter/adventure for PC, titled <i>Shadow of the Panopticon</i>, set to be published by Lighthouse Interactive in 2008.<br />
<br />
Telos' interest in Wii comes from two angles: first, they believe that Wii will have the deepest penetration and most focus on gameplay of all the next generation offerings, giving Telos and other small developers the "strongest opportunity" to reach the largest market possible.  Second, Telos sees Wii's focus as an analog to their own focus, emphasizing innovative and novel gameplay instead of pursuing big-budget graphical powerhouses.<br />
<br />
Yeomans has been working in television production for several years, with various production credits in documentaries, animation, commercials, music videos, and even the Sci-Fi Channel series <i>Lexx</i>.  He considers his background in both business management and creative work a hybrid force he feels will serve him and Telos well as they go forward in the game development business.<br />
<br />
Telos' hope is to get together a Wii concept, finance it, and find a publisher over the next two years and be developing a title for the console in 2009.
