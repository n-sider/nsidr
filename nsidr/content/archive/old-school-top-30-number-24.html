<i>We're counting down to the Wii's launch with a daily look at what retro games we'd like to see on the Virtual Console.  Each also features a Virtual Console Likelihood rating.  A rating of 5 means the game has officially been announced for the service.

What's this?  Enix made a game for the N64?  Yes, my friends, they did.  Actually they made three.  Wonder Project was only released in Japan, and Ogre Battle 64 was one of the best games that the N64 ever saw.  This one, Mischief Makers, is a 2D action platformer.  What the "action" in action platformer means is "you get to shoot things".  When it came out, people were calling it "2 1/2" D because of the amount of stuff going on in the foreground and background.  <br />
<br />
When Professor Theo, a stereotypical absent-minded-anime-pervert-old-man-professor, gets kidnapped by "The Empire" on planet Clancer, his robot maid Marina Liteyears sets out to rescue him.  Along the way, she'll use bombs and other powerups to defend herself and complete each stage.  Like many platformers, she must also collect gems along the way.  These yellow gems reveal more of the ending.<br />

This game's a lot of fun, and is one of the last great 2D platformers to come out.  Treasure has been pretty friendly with Nintendo recently, and with Square-Enix interested in Virtual Console it seems like it wouldn't be that hard to negotiate.  The problem I forsee is that people tend to forget that this game came out, and so the demand might not be there.  If you're reading this Nintendo - Mischief Makers rules, and I'm one person that will definitely pay for the chance to play it again!<br />

There was some discussion in the N-Forums recently about how without Super Mario 64 as a launch title, the N64 would have had barely any chance of success at all.  Some also added that Wave Race 64 was the other big reason that the N64's first game release drought was not as much of a detriment as it could have been.  I agree with this opinion, because Wave Race 64 is a blast.  Even though it was a launch title, it still managed to put out some of the N64's best graphics, in particular the amazingly accurate wave motion.  <br />
<br />
Compared to today's racers, there doesn't seem to be much to Wave Race 64.  Four drivers and nine tracks total, plus a time trial mode and stunt mode.  Despite the apparent lack of content, there are shortcuts to find, and each track can be raced in a reverse mode.  There are also quite a few bonus codes and the ability to ride a dolphin.  Completing tricks during a race are pretty fun to do, but it's stunt mode that really gets you addicted to competing for a high score.  Multiplayer is also pretty fun, but I'm hoping we get some online support with the Virtual Console.<br />

During each race, not only must you beat your opponents, you must slalom between bouys in the water.  Missing bouys slows down your jet ski, and if you miss too many you are disqualified.  It adds enough difficulty to the game that you'll get to experience each beautiful course a few times, which for me was a great thing.  These courses are spectacular.  Wave Race was also re-released in Japan with Rumble Pak support, so hopefully rumble will make it to the Virtual Console version.  Be sure to check this one out!
