Whoa.  Did you know <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/33625/Study-Average-dev-cost-as-high-as-28m">games today cost</a> an average of $10-28 million to develop? <br />
<br />
Meanwhile something on the scale of <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i> is <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/gtav-to-sell-at-least-18-million-units-analyst-6328099">estimated to cost</a> over $100 million by the time it's finished. <br />
<br />
Development budgets are astronomical, requiring tens-of-millions of dollars.  One failure can mean the complete destruction and demise of a company.  It's no wonder many developers feel the only opportune time to introduce a new franchise is alongside a new console, when there's less competition and more opportunity to stand out in the crowd.<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Frank Gibeau, President of EA Labels told LeMonde.fr</span>I believe in new IPs. But the long cycle of the recent consoles makes it difficult to create them, so the best decision, at present, is to move innovation in already established franchises. It is always necessary to be creative in this industry, or else you die.</div></div> <br />
Mario is on its 188th release.  That's <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/search/index.html?game=mario&platform=0&s=s">not an exaggeration</a>.  There have literally been 188 Mario games.  Which is all the more reason the Wii U debut would be the perfect time to introduce a new concept, new universe, and new cast of characters.  Mario has a lot of baggage (full of bob-ombs, toads and yoshis).  With a new Mario game, Nintendo is locked and bound by tradition. They can evolve it, sure.  But it's still familiar. Nintendo had the opportunity to wow us with something new but chose to once again take risks with hardware but play it safe with software.  It's time to accept that this is a primary element of Nintendo's strategy.  They take risks with their hardware and support it with the familiarity of their existing brands.<br />
<br />
It's also time to accept the fact that Nintendo's executives are completely out of touch with the wants of core gamers. Nintendo no longer employs executives who can relate or understand core gamers.  Which doesn't come as a surprise; after all, they've spent the past six years hiring executives and management who have an intimate understanding of casual gamers and casual tastes.<br />
<br />
Look no further than <i>Pikmin 3</i>, the one game highlighted as an internally developed core game.  Funny that Miyamoto himself admitted the original Pikmin was <a href="http://www.4gamer.net/games/092/G009297/20100208012/">designed to appeal to high school girls</a>. I'm not saying that's the only audience it appeals to - call me a school girl because I love Pikmin.  But Nintendo's executives today try to paint the game as one made exclusively for the core gamer.<br />
<br />
Nintendo is like the Tea party.  The Tea party has moved politics so far to the right that the Democrats now fill the role of the Republicans.  Think of it as a scale of 0-100.  A few years ago Core Games had a value of 0.  The Bridge Games (games that were half core and half casual appealing to both audiences) had a value of 50.  Casual Games had a value of 100.<br />

<br />
With Nintendo's rearrangement of the scale, Core Games now have a value of 50. Bridge Games have a value of 100.  And Casual Games have expanded the range to 150. <br />

<br />
In other words, Nintendo believes its Bridge Games (games like <i>Pikmin</i> and <i>Animal Crossing</i>) are now Core Games.  It shouldn't surprise anyone then to see the <i>Nintendoland</i> minigames as the highlight of its E3 2012 press conference. <b>On Nintendo's new casual-to-core spectrum, <i>Nintendoland</i> is a core game.</b><br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Nintendo, Core Gamers are still referring to the old model when evaluating games.  This explains why most reactions to Nintendo's press conference reflected people who were disappointed, felt abandoned or felt neglected.  Nintendo tried to reassure these fans with third-party games like <i>Batman</i> and <i>Mass Effect</i>.  Unfortunately, most core gamers own more than one console.  Which means there's little appeal in the release of year old games we've already played.<br />
<br />
For the past three decades we've been the only child - always demanding and always getting what we want.  But now we have a new sibling and are forced to share. Change can be emotionally draining.  So lets follow our five stages of grief.<br />
<br />
<b>Denial:</b> "It's a console launch," proclaims the Nintendo gamer.  "No one ever has good games at launch.  Good games take time to develop.  Nintendo will surely release a new Zelda and Metroid in a few years."  <br />
<br />
<b>Anger:</b> "...oh god, minigames."  <i>*runs to nearest gaming community forum to vent frustration with extra exclamation marks and frown faces :(*</i><br />
<br />
<b>Bargaining:</b> "I buy a Nintendo console for Nintendo games.  Even though I played Batman, Mass Effect and others on my PS3/360, I'll buy them again with hope that third-parties see the sales and realize there's a market for their games on a Nintendo console."<br />
<br />
<b>Depression:</b> "Oh god...minigames."<br />
<br />
<b>Acceptance:</b> "My Nintendo console will have good Nintendo games, primarily casual with an occasional amazing core game.  I'll own another console for everything else."
