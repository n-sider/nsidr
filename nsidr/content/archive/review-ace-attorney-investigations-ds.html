Before I go any further, I've got to get one thing in the open&mdash;I'm an <i>Ace Attorney</i> fan.  I've got a follow-on admission to that: as an <i>Ace Attorney</i> fan, a game starring Miles Edgeworth is basically a dream come true (particularly when it arrives two weeks early from Capcom for review.)  And if it didn't deliver on those expectations, well... even when faced with a mediocre series entry like <i>Justice For All</i>, I'm going to enjoy myself.  It would take a disaster of mammoth proportions to interfere with that.<br />
<br />
I <i>was</i> a teensy bit concerned with the nature of the game, dispensing with the actual courtroom battles and all.  (Much lower on the concern list was the switch from first-person investigation to third-person.)  As it turned out, I did not have to worry one bit.<br />
<br />

<i>Ace Attorney Investigations</i> barely even feels like the spinoff it's been said to be.  It's true that Edgeworth doesn't confront anyone in a real series-trademark court battle at any time during the game, but that doesn't stop him from using the tried-and-true press/present system to extract the truth during his investigations.  If you've played <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/investigating-the-miles-edgeworth-demo">the demo</a>, you got a little taste of this already; rest assured you'll be taking on testimony after testimony in chains worthy of the series' lengthiest court battles before the game is over.<br />
<br />
The new third-person investigation system, though, does change things up a bit, and I think it does so entirely for the better.  The old first-person view meant that each character you might need to talk to would "live" in one location, necessitating a huge spread of locations when things got complicated.  Now, characters get to move freely with the story, letting the writers focus a lot more tightly.  The Ace Attorney series being the sharply linear affair that it is&mdash;I am of the mind this is linearity is a good thing, by the way&mdash;this sort of focus benefits the proceedings quite a bit.<br />
<br />
These proceedings are some of the most enjoyable in the series, too.  It perhaps helped that the game's five episodes are all very tightly interrelated&mdash;even more so than a typical Ace Attorney game, the whole feels like one huge story.  It never feels like it's being dragged down by the inanity of one case.  There are a few character appearances I could have done without, but they never manage to kill the game's momentum.<br />

I do have to pick a little bit on a couple problems that remain endemic to the series as they up once again in <i>Investigations</i>.  As a defender of the English language, I'm going to remember such gaffes as "make due" or "training regiment" for quite some time, alongside some really oddly-punctuated sentences.  (Commas, people, commas!)  There was also the need to save and reset several times, particularly near the end, as I struggled to figure out not the nature of the crime, but what the script expected me to do.  But, let's be realistic.  Anyone who's an <i>Ace Attorney</i> fan is used to this by now&mdash;it's the wild, intense story that keeps us going, and we'll remember that long after the temporary pain of a few save-reload cycles has passed.<br />
<br />
That's why I proudly keep all these games in my collection and continue to recommend them whenever I get an opportunity.  They're just so entertainingly done that a few flaws quickly fade into the background.  <i>Investigations</i>' little tweaks to the formula as well as its top-notch story makes them fade even faster than usual, leaving me with a game that I can solidly recommend.  I do hope to see the courtroom return again someday, but the sheer fun of Edgeworth's outing made it something I didn't miss at all.  If you're new to the series, you may still want to play Phoenix Wright's games first (though I don't think it's an absolute requirement); but those who aren't should not hesitate to go for <i>Investigations</i> at their earliest opportunity.
