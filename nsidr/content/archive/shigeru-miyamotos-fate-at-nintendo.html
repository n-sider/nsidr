<p>Prior to the start of E3 this week, rumors started circulating that Mr. Miyamoto would announce his departure from Nintendo at Nintendos Press Conference. Well the conference came and went with no word of Miyamoto's pending retirement, until now:

<b>Shigeru Miyamoto:</b><i>But first there's something I'd like to clear up. I've heard that some of you have heard that my heart is doing so well these days. Is there a rumor going around? [Laughs] There are rumors going around that I've actually quit Nintendo? At least, that's the rumor going on over in Japan right now. [laughs] At the hotel yesterday I had a good kilometer swim, and my heart's doing fine, so you don't need to worry. 

<p>Actually, things are really going great for me, I'm really enjoying work and a part of a great situation at Nintendo.</i>

<p>There you go, Miyamoto is staying at Nintendo.
