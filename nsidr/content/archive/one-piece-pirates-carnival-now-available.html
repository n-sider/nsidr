<b><a href="http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/one-piece-pirates-carnival/733214p1.html">GameSpy</a> says</b> (2/5),<br>
"It's nice to see a party game that breaks free from the aforementioned "roll the dice and advance on a board" style of gameplay, and the Othello-inspired premise results in some pretty decent multiplayer action. If only the mini-games that you have to constantly play were more alluring. Fans of the One Piece series will appreciate the extensive amount of voiceover work that appears in the game, including plenty of situation-specific conversations between characters (although sorry, otaku, it's all the English dub cast), and they'll clearly get the most out of this title. Anyone else might want to just dust off that old Othello set that's gathering dust in the back of their parents' closet."
