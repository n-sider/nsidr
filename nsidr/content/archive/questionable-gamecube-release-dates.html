<p>There have been several discrepancies among online retailers regarding a few GameCube title release dates, according to GCAdvanced.</p>

<p>EB Games has Resident Evil 4 listed for a February 1, 2005 release date. This comes in light of Capcom releasing a revised schedule last week listing the title under a "Winter 2004" date.  GameStop meanwhile still has <i>Resident Evil 4</i> listed for a November 16, 2004 release.</p>

<p>The n-Space GameCube shooter <i>Geist</i> has a March 1, 2005 release according to GameStop.  Nintendo of America meanwhile still has the title lined up for a non-specific Q4, 2004 release.</p>

<p>As further details are given, we'll let you know.</p>
