<p>Satoru Iwata told the Yomiuri Shimbun that Nintendo intends to ease the transition from the GameCube to the "Revolution", according to GamesIndustry.biz.  Nintendo is familiar with the transitions from console generations, having already been through over three of them, and will likely use that knowledge to effectively approach this coming one. It's not known however the exact length of time Nintendo will continue releasing software for the GameCube once the Revolution is on the market.</p>
