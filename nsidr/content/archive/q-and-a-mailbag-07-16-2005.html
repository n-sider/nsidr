<p><b style="font-size: 20px">N-Sider Q&A Mailbag</b><br><i>Column by <a href="staffview.php?staffid=10">Jeff Van Camp</a>, <a href="staffview.php?staffid=28">Travis Woodside</a>, <a href="staffview.php?staffid=5">Glen Bayer</a></i>

<p><b>Edition: 07-16-2005</b>

<p>I keep getting worse and worse at updating. Things will likely continue to be off schedule for a while yet, as Ive been busy with a lot of other things both relating to N-Sider and not. Travis is good at getting his replies in pretty quick. Im just not getting the column up on time. In any case, we got some really good letters this edition. So we have that going for us, which is nice. Anyway, be sure to send your questions, criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>. They will receive responseseventually.

<p>In this edition, HD is still a very hot topic, readers sing the praises of N-Sider.com, Glen answers a very intelligent email, a few readers voice their solutions to the sticky stuff sometimes on DVD cases, we talk about voice acting in Zelda, one guy doesnt realize that all his wishes are completely futile, and a regular mailbagger compares Nintendo to a box of cereal.

<h3>N-Sider UpdatesNo Way!</h3>
<p>So since everyone is giving you bullshit questions like omg Nintendo not having HD is going to ruin them. I decided to ask the most important one. Which is where did you guys find the time to do all this updating on your website? I mean do you guys secretly train little elf's to do your work or is it because your now taking speed and can not go to speed for long periods of time? Huh HUH?? These questions I have are destroying my social life.

<p>Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo wait....... ok...... never mind I don't have a social life. So anyways hope you guys keep up with the great work it is much appreciated.  I love you long time!  ;)

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Nice to hear back from you again Jeremy. Yeah were trying our best to get the site updating more regularly. It will be a bumpy road ahead, but I hope youll see some improvement from here on in. We are going to be diligently trying to keep news updated and are working hard redesigning the backend of our site to make everything look prettier and run easier for all of you. (Notice, for example, that you can now Search through articles and games.) So yeah, even if you dont see constant front site updates, remember that we are constantly working behind the scenes to make N-Sider a better place.

<h3>Zelda N-Depth</h3>
<p>Just wanted to say: Awesome content that just went up guys.  Good work all around.  I had to skip through some details during the Zelda N-Depth but even that was a great read.

<p>Good show!

<p><i>- Jason</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Thank you, kind sir.  The <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=466>Zelda N-Depth</a> took Chris and me quite a long time.  Its kind of sad since we know few people will bother to read the whole thing, but ultimately it was a lot of fun.  Besides, in my own nerdy way it makes me feel like a part of gaming history.  I was that guy who covered that Zelda game.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Well I read the whole thing and it was one of the best pieces Ive ever read on our site. Chris and Travis did an incredible job on the Zelda piece. We asked of them the moon, and they delivered us the sun.

<h3>A Letter for Glen</h3>
<p>Glen:

<p>Your help would be very much appreciated. My team is doing a group marketing report for a school paper on Nintendos Gamecube..

<p>Problem is finding verifiable / credible information regarding  exactly the info in your June 9th report.

<p><a href=https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=867> https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=867</a>


<p>For a school paper -- I am sure that you understand that quoting stats from an academic / company / academic journal web site will be a bit more credible as opposed to just finding a web site that has the needed info.

<p>If possible - am also trying to narrow down what top 5 or so countries have the greatest unit sales of Gamecube. Any and all other info that you would like to provide would be very much appreciated.

<p>Thanks

<p><i>- John M.</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Glen: </b>Hello John:

<p>The best place to locate official Nintendo GameCube hardware and software sales would be Nintendo's yearly financial reports:

<p>Nintendo of America's translated version:<br>
<a href=http://www.nintendo.com/corp/annual_report.jsp>http://www.nintendo.com/corp/annual_report.jsp</a>

<p>Nintendo Co., Ltd. version:<br>
<a href=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/kessan/index.html>http://www.nintendo.co.jp/kessan/index.html</a>

<p>The numbers are as accurate as you'll find them. (In case you have trouble locating them on the Japanese page, the financials are located on the bottom.) Although the financials themselves are both for the most part in English, the Japanese financials sometimes have more detailed numbers.

<p>Unfortunately if you're looking for numbers that are quarterly or weekly you will need to use another source.  The NPD Group releases North American sales each month but acquiring these tables costs thousands of dollars.  All we get each month are those numbers that are leaked from a charitable person.  I have a lot of them saved so if you need them from a particular month, I might be able to help, but since they're not very organized I can't guarantee I have very many.

<p>These are where weekly Japanese sales are acquired:<br>
<a href=http://www.m-create.com/jpn/s_ranking.html>http://www.m-create.com/jpn/s_ranking.html</a>

<p>I suggest using a translation service such as Altavista Babelfish.  Just copy and paste the above link into the box on the webpage below:<br>
<a href=http://babelfish.altavista.com/>http://babelfish.altavista.com/</a>

<p>The top five countries in terms of Nintendo GameCube hardware sales are probably United States, Canada, Japan, United Kingdom and either Australia, Germany or France.  I don't have a source for this information but since they are Nintendo's largest markets (and each has a subsidiary located within it), I feel it's a logical conclusion to come to.  The following are Nintendo's subsidiaries if you're interested:

<p>Nintendo of America Inc.<br>
Nintendo of Canada Ltd.<br>
Nintendo of Europe GmbH<br>
Nintendo of France S.A.R.L<br>
Nintendo of Benelux B.V<br>
Nintendo of Espana, S.A<br>
Nintendo Australia Pty. Ltd.<br>
Nintendo of Phuten Co., Ltd.

<p>Good luck with your marketing report.  Let us know if you guys find the needed info.

<h3>Sticky Solutions Part 1</h3>
<p>Tell Carlito C. to just pick up some new empty cases from Nintendo's online store.

<p>They sell for $1 apiece, 5 for $4, or 10 for $7.  And if my memory serves me, orders under $6 will ship US Mail for $2.  Beats breathing those Goo Gone fumes... or maybe it doesn't... ;)

<p><i>- Mattie Behrens</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Youve now told him. Haha. For those wondering, this is a response to a letter from Carlito (entitled Removing the Sticky Stuff) in the <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/columnview.php?columnid=129>June 22 mailbag</a>. He was having trouble removing the sticky stuff left by store stickers from his game cases.


<p><hr>

<div style="margin: 0px 10px; padding: 5px; background: #E0E0E0">
<h3>Sticky Solutions Part 2</h3>
<p>one thing i do to remove the stickers so they dont leave the gunk..... heat.  have a hair dryer, or a fireplace with a blower, or whatever, and as it warms up, the glue kind of softens or something and it allows it to be much easier removed, usually without any gunk whatsoever once you get used to doing it. its usually wise to do this without the paper in the case, because that could slightly darken by burning.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Yet more sticky solutions!

<h3>HD Being Blown Out of Proportion?</h3>
<p>It really seems to me that people are making a much bigger deal of this whole HD topic than it should be. The only people who really care about the HD subject are a few hardcore gamers that for some reason think having a little bit better of a picture is going to make that much of a difference in the console wars. I get a strong feeling that most gamers, hardcore and casual alike could care less whether a system supports HD or not. Maybe its just the gamers I know who don't care one way or the other and that it's a bigger issue in the actual gaming community, but I doubt it.

<p>Currently HD tv only has a 10% penetration into US households, which isn't that much when you think about it. Sure that number is going to go up in the next console cycle, but by that time won't most gamers who might take an interest in that kind of thing already own consoles. I know I don't have an HD ready tv and don't plan on having one in the next couple years or so, even though I'd like too, I just can't afford it. And even if I did own an HD tv I don't think I would influence my decision on which console to buy.

<p>And lets not forget that making HD ready games is bound to cost more. I am already nervous about the prospects of having to pay 60 or 70 bucks for a game rather than the current 40 - 50 dollars. We all know that Nintendo is trying to bring new gamers into the fold and don't you think it would be more difficult to do this if the price of games went up 10 dollars or so? It seems to me that by not mandating a frivolous feature Nintendo is sticking with the strategy of trying to bring in new consumers as well as keep the more intense video game players in the fold as well. By being cheaper than the competition Nintendo may bring in new consumers and at the same time I highly doubt any gamer who wasn't already compltley closed off to Nintendo is going to be pushed away by this decision. It remains to be seen whether or not this strategy works for Nintendo but it doesn't seem like a bad idea to me.

<p>Anyway this whole HD thing has been blown way out of proportion. It really isn't that big of a deal. Plus Nintendo has only said they aren't requiring HD support, it is still a possibility that there will be some sort of HD support on the system. I wish people would quit jumping to conclusions, we still barely know anything about Nintendo's Revolution.

<p>So lets everyone just take a chill pill.

<p><i>- Colin Harrison</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>I think most people are concerned about it just because Nintendos competitors will have HD support.  Nintendo fans in this day and age dont seem too concerned with what Nintendo does, but how everyone else thinks of Nintendo.  Its sad to think that gamers could miss out on the wonderful gaming Nintendo provides and that little things like no HD support scares fans into believing such sadness will continue.  On the other end of things, if HD is the future I think people just want to believe that their gaming console can last in the future while they pretend that a new console wont come out in five years to replace it.  I do agree with you though.  Its really not a big deal.  Just like the PS2s anti-aliasing issue wasnt a big deal.  I mean look at how successful that console is.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>I agree. HD support should be the least of our concerns at this point. Its going to come down to how well Nintendo executes its online plans, the games the Revolution has in its first two holiday seasons, and the GAMES (yet again). The ball is entirely in Nintendos court. It has the ability to create franchises and games that appeal to any market segment it wants. The question is: which segments will it choose to appeal to most?

<h3>Voicing Zelda</h3>
<p>I noticed a letter on your site today concerning voices in Zelda games. I, for one, am largely against the idea of adding voice overs to the series. For one, I'm not entirely confident in Nintendo's voice over choices (Star Fox); plus there's the whole "poor voice acting is still in the majority in video games" thing. I'd probably be a bit less apprehensive if Link remained silent and other characters talked, however.

<p>Anyway, in a semi-recent interview (I believe with Aonuma), the developers were asked if the game would have voice acting. The response was somewhat general, saying that they were looking into various methods.

<p>I was thinking that the best route for the Zelda series to take would simply be to invent its own spoken language. It already has its own written one, more or less. Games like ICO have pulled this off well, while Star Trek and Star Wars have done the same for their aliens and Lord of the Rings for its different races.

<p>To me this just seems like the best angle. It would keep the Zelda universe feeling unique and interesting, it would fit its own world properly (why would they speak English anyway?) and it would help calm down the people who want voice acting without completely ruining it for people who don't want it.

<p>My hope is that Nintendo pursues this in the future...whether it's for Twilight Princess or beyond. Even I am getting tired of the same old Link grunts.

<p><i>- Tony Jacobs</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>You know, thats not a bad idea.  I could actually see that working.  Not only could it help some conversations now feel like theyre muted, but itd also lead to us Nintendo nerds getting an English-Hylian dictionary.  Soon the Trekkies will envy even us...

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Star Trek features primarily English speaking aliens (somehow the Universal Translator translates their visual mouth movements as well). But aside from that, I am generally in favor of the people around Link being voiced completely, with Link remaining an eerily silent main character. Players have to identify with Link. Its their adventure after all. However, I am against any argument that voice acting shouldnt be done simply because you have no confidence in Nintendos ability to do it right. If Nintendo chooses to pursue voice acting, it has a commitment to the world to do it well. If it fails, then the game will suffer and sales will suffer, justifiably. So if you have no confidence in Nintendos ability to do it right, then that points to a larger lack of confidence in the company, as a whole.

<h3>Belive</h3>
<p>I belive HD will not matter too much since not many people own a HD TV. Also I belive Nintendo will have some other device to enhance the graphics quality. What do you guys think?

<p><i>- TJ Game0ver Wasiuk</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>As I said before, I dont think its a big deal either.  HD would be nice, but, honestly, I dont even have an HD TV.  Id never be able to use the thing.  Besides, if the Revolution is as revolutionary as its being hyped up to be then maybe theres a really good reason HD isnt being supported.

<div style="margin: 0px 10px; padding: 5px; background: #E0E0E0">
<h3>Error Accusations!</h3>
<p>You made a mistake when talking about the Revolution's HD abilities. Okay, the whole point the Nintendo community is up in arms about this is because Nintendo of America person Perrin Kaplan confirmed to IGNcube that they have no plans to support HD in the Rev.  You're response to the rant about the issue makes no sense because you argue it as pure speculation, when in fact Nintendo confirmed this choice.

<p><i>- Joe</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Though I didnt comment on HD support in the last edition of the Q&A, I will step in here and say that Perrin Kaplan saying they have no <i>plans</i> to support HD is not a confirmation it will not be a part of the system.  As such, I feel that Jeff was justified in his rant.  It may be looking unlikely that HD support will be a part of the Revolution, but the system still isnt finished.  Lets just stop freaking out and look forward to the games.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Well, that would have been clearer to everyone if IGNcube would have posted that as a news story instead of an editorial. But thats another issue. I only made the comment about speculation because nothing has been confirmed and nothing is set in stone at this point. The system is 1.5 years from hitting shelves (I estimate) and a thousand things could change between now and the future world of late 2006.

<h3>Whats the Deal with RAM?</h3>
<p>Hello again.

<p>First off, thanks for answering my question. Most sites don't.

<p>Second off, as I was reading your reply, I noticed you don't want Nintendo to skimp out on RAM for the Revolution, correct? Well, is it just me, or is this impossible to -- if Nintendo truly wants to do what they said they want? Didn't Iwata himself say that he wants either faster load times or faster start-up times? Either way, both of those deal with RAM (correct?). So, if they want speady load/start up times, they need RAM. More RAM then Sony/MS.

<p>And thats it. Hope you reply once again!

<p><i>- Allen</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>You make a very good point. We do know that Nintendo will be partnering with MoSys and utilizing 1T-SRAM in the Revolution, as it did with the GameCube. (1T-SRAM consumes low amounts of power, has the speed and functionality of SRAM, and allows for the density of DRAM.) This is definitely a great thing, though the quantity of 1T-SRAM is still unknown. Nintendo could be using it along with other cheaper forms of RAM. In any case, yes the right speed, amount, and type of RAM is an important piece of the puzzle to create a system thats optimized for gaming.

<h3>Sign My HD PetitionPlease!</h3>
<p>Dear Jeff Van Camp,

<p>Im a representative from a new and exciting movement of videogame enthusiasts concerned about the direction that next-generation gaming is taking. As an admirer of your site, N-Sider.com, I felt that it would be polite to let you know of what I do and the movement I am witnessing. As you know, Nintendo has stated that they have no current plans to implement high-definition display support as a feature for the upcoming Nintendo Revolution. Many gamers like myself, are confused, upset, and a little let-down with this direction taken by Nintendo. <a href=http://1080up.org>http://1080up.org</a> is a site where gamers can come together to voice their opinions regarding Nintendos direction; and to receive information and updates on the Revolutions HD support status.

<p>As a fellow member of the gaming media, I would ask for a little bit of help getting the word out about 1080up.org and about what we do. We seek to be a professional and strong voice in the gaming community. If you would like any further information, or if you would like to conduct an interview, please contact us. Linking to our site would be appreciated and encouraged.

<p>Thank you for your time. I look forward to your continued coverage of Nintendo and their products.

<p>Sincerely,

<p><i>- Tim Forbrook</i><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Everyone has the right to their opinion. Honestly, Im not too concerned about HD from a market or personal perspective. But anyway, since you guys seem less rabid and more rational than most people who email me about this, I decided to put this in the mailbag. If anyone out there is interested in petitioning for Revolution to output in HD resolutions, give it a try. Who knows, maybe Nintendo will listen. Then again, probably not. In any case, I will be withholding judgment of Revolution until I know what its all about.

<h3>Pipe Dreams</h3>
<p>Hello N-Sider! I'm a great fan of Capcom and I'm sad because some games that are on the PS2 aren't available on the GameCube. So have send a mail to Capcom (megamail@capcom.com) asking this three things:

<p>1.-A Devil May Cry port to the GameCube, I would like the trilogy to be ported to Nintendo's console because I don't have the money to buy a PlayStation 2 and I think those games are really good. I have seen in the internet some petition asking this same thing, for example here is one: <a href=http://www.petitiononline.com/port2gcn/petition.html>http://www.petitiononline.com/port2gcn/petition.html</a>

<p>I think that maybe the game wouldn't sell a lot but it could still sell enough to generate profits, after all you only have to make a port, not an entirely new game

<p>2.-Also, I think you should make a port of Capcom Classics Collection, just watch the sales of MegaMan Anniversay Collection for the GameCube, they are really good. And a lot of those games were release in the NES or SNES, so the GameCube has a fan base to this title.

<p>3.-To finish, you could make a port of MegaMan X7 and MegaMan X8, you can see the sales of MegaMan X Command Mission for the GameCube (compared to the PlayStation 2, these are better), maybe those games could be put in a same game (of two discs) and in that way it could attract a lot of people.

<p>Remember that Viewtiful Joe (for the GameCube) sold 100.000 copies more than the PlayStation 2 version and with Viewtiful Joe 2 happened a similar thing. (end of the letter)


<p>What do you think of this? Do you have some others ideas? It would be very good that some other people send mails to Capcom asking tha same or something similar and maybe in this way we could enjoy those awesome titles on our loved GameCube.

<p>Thank you very much.

<p><b>Travis: </b>Im going to level with you here.  It wont work.  I know its nice to think a company will read your letter, shed a tear, and port the games for you, but it wont happen because of two things.  One, Nintendos current position in the console war really doesnt make ports of older games very smart.  Would I buy a Devil May Cry Trilogy for the GameCube?  In a heart beat, but it doesnt help that the majority of gamers already have a PS2, a system that already saw the games release.  And two, new consoles are around the corner.  Youd be better off letting Capcom know gamers are interested in some of their franchises moving over to the Revolution for their sequels.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Here are my numbered responses to your numbered query.<br>
1. Not going to happen.<br>
2. Not going to happen, but a good idea.<br>
3. Not going to happen, but its fun to dream.

<h3>GTA 4</h3>
<p>What would it take for a game like GTA4 to appear on a Nintendo home console? I'm kind of curious about how these exclusivity deals function, and as there seems to be an Evil Third Party Conspiracy to keep titles like these from Nintendo's consoles, I'm wondering if that trend can ever be reversed, and how?

<p> [Insert picture of Rockstar employees having a real good laugh at the mere suggestion of ever releasing GTA on the Revolution here.]

<p> (Disclaimer: Not that I'm dying to play GTA - I might consider buying a GTA game if I didn't have to buy a console I don't want to play it, but mostly I'm just curious about how the system works. Is it as simple as console manufacturers paying small mountains of cash to keep key games exclusive? But... but surely, there must be some conspiracy to push everybody over on the filthy mainstream consoles... right?)

<p>Yours cheerfully,

<p><i>- The Duke of Prunes</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>It would take a lot of cash put forth by Nintendo to secure a timed exclusivity deal with Rockstar on the game as well as a whole lot of coercion. Theres no way that Nintendo will actively put forth that much effort to secure a series they themselves have criticized over the years. However, if Nintendo is somehow able to target its next console at a demographic that is more likely to purchase GTA type games and the system becomes very successful, I could see GTA being ported to the Revolution, much like it came to the Xbox and PC during this generation. Selling consoles brings with it opportunity. The PlayStation 2 remains so huge today because it gets so many smaller exclusive games (<i>Katamari Damacy</i> is a recent example). Many developers do not have the resources to develop a game for more than one platform, and I suspect that this will only increase over the next five years. Therefore they usually choose the PlayStation 2 because it has the largest install base and therefore the highest chance for sales.

The game looks great.  But I digress. If anyone has experienced the problem Eric described, please let me know. Ill look into it myself as well. Ive never heard of anything like that.

<h3>Letter of the Week</h3>
<p>I think the "Nintendo needs to..." in the latest Q&A was the grain of rice that tipped the scale.  Is anyone else <i>sick</i> of this phrase?

<p>Anyway, maybe I'm living in a bubble; maybe because I read primarily video game news, I think arrogant and demanding journalism is unique to Nintendo.  I thank <i>you</i>, N-Sider, for not being so much a part of this as your readers (and for certainly not being half as bad as most all other news sites... and comic strips... and discussion forums... and...).

<p>Ahem.  So, I picked a few random companies.  Instead of being a video game fan, for a few minutes this morning I was a breakfast cereal fan (General Mills) and an automotive fan (Toyota).  Both companies, for the most part, involve themselves with only one product--as does Nintendo.  I thought of doing Sony and Microsoft for comparision, but the results of pure video game journalism would be skewed by CD players, television sets, operating systems, and whatnot.  Here's what Google told me:

<p>"Nintendo needs to"  6900<br>
"Nintendo has to"  3500<br>
"Nintendo must"  5090<br>
Total: 15,490

<p>"General Mills needs to"  39<br>
"General Mills has to"  12<br>
"General Mills must"  56<br>
Total:  107

<p>"Toyota needs to"  678<br>
"Toyota has to"  1220<br>
"Toyota must"  562<br>
Total:  2,460

<p>... Shit.  I guess it <i>is</i> just us.  What do you think?  Gamers seem to enjoy partaking in distant, uninformed speculation.  Perhaps, though, it's the niche factor of video games:  <i>Everyone</i> eats cereal.  <i>Everyone</i> drives a car (though not all of them are car buffs).  Know what I mean?  Maybe as niche consumers, gamers feel their opinions hold more importance.  I decided to try a few companies in niche industries--totals only...

<p>Adobe:  3,032<br>
MTV:  4,111<br>
Marvel ("must," excluding "must haves"):  5,510

<p>The numbers are a little higher, but even added together they can't reach Nintendo's total.  Maybe it's the fanatacism, though; it <i>did</i> sound a little silly using the term "cereal fan" earlier.  Perhaps this is the distinguishing characteristic that causes customers to make demands on the business side...

<p>The Pistons:  1,777<br>
The Red Sox:  6,710<br>
The Yankees:  3,305

<p>Close, but still no cigar.  Perhaps, it's more of a cult following...

<p>"The Catholic Church" -- 6,986<br>
"The Baptist Church"  64<br>
"The Mormons" -- 936

<p>... not quite.  For now, I've come to the non-conclusion that Nintendo is a combination of all these things.  To the hardest of the hardcore, they are a cult.  To the fanboys, they are a team, competing for first place.  To most others, they are simply a niche company.  Nintendo itself, however, seems determined to become a household item (like cereal or cars) and--ultimately--they choose their own path.  Perhaps this chasm between reality and the perceptions of Nintendo's consumers is causing tension, and everyone wants to throw their own reality into the picture.

<p>I hope that one day Nintendo's total is less than the Baptist Church's.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Video games are the first solely digital entertainment medium. They were born out of the computer revolution of the past thirty years and are probably one of the most distinct entertainment options we have in the information society we live in. The internet and the home computer were born out of this very same technology revolution. Many personal computers are even designed to play video games themselves. So, by default alone, the internet is going to be populated very densely with technologically oriented individuals -- people who have a much higher probability of purchasing and playing video games. On top of that, Nintendo is a company that millions of gamers remember very fondly from their childhood. Many (including myself) credit it with rebuilding a dead video game industry from the ground up. Given its current status in the market and precarious position for the past few years, Im surprised the numbers you belted out arent higher.

<p>Given the nature of the video game industry and its correlation to the online world, Im not at all surprised by your findings. There are undoubtedly a large number of people out there voicing uneducated and undeveloped opinions about Nintendo and other video game companies. That comes with an industry of this kind. With a little cash (or sometimes none at all) anyone can make a website or web log and say whatever they want. This isnt something that will change.

<p>To attack my statement based solely on the fact that I said Nintendo needs to just rings of absurdity. I wholly respect you and your opinion on the subject, but whether or not you agree, I made it clear that I was giving my own distinct opinion on the issue I was discussing. I never claimed, nor will I ever claim, to be the utmost authority on all things Nintendo. I can name off lists of people who know a lot more than me about a plethora of game related topics, but I feel that I have earned the right to voice my opinion on subjects like that.

<p>Just for fun though, I looked up some choice searches of my own on Google. Heres what I found.

<p>If you compare Nintendo to other technology oriented search queries, its numbers become much more reasonable. Its just a fact of life that technology users are much more prone to discuss technology than cereal. Theres little more to it than that. Im glad you wrote in though.
