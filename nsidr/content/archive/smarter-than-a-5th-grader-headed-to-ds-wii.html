THQ has snagged the license to game show "Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader", and they're aiming to get the game&mdash;already on PC&mdash;to both DS and Wii.  They describe the game like so:<br />

<div class="quote">With authentic commentary from host Jeff Foxworthy, the game features all of the classmate peer-pressure and wisecracks that fans of the TV show have come to love.<br />
<br />
In Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?, players will answer up to 11 questions to win one million virtual dollars. The game consists of more than 3,000 challenging questions in 28 subjects, all from grade school textbooks. Similar to the show, players can choose to receive help from one of their five classmates and use "Peek" and "Copy" cheats in order to advance to the next round. If players cannot answer all 11 questions correctly, they must "drop out of school" admitting: "I am NOT smarter than a 5th grader".</div><br />
<i>Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader</i> is set to land on DS this fall, followed by the Wii release in 2008.
