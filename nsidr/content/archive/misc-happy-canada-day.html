<p> Happy Canada day to all our Canadian readers. Today is Canada's 139th Birthday; Beginning in 1958, the Canadian government orchestrated Dominion Day celebrations, usually consisting of Trooping the Colours ceremonies on Parliament Hill in the afternoon and evening, followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display.</p>

<p> The N-Sider staff would like to wish all Canadians a safe evening of celebrations and remind you all to avoid driving while under the influence of any substances including your Nintendo DS.</p>
