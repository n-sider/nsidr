<h3>Conceiving a Console</h3>

<p>The N2000, N200X, Project: Dolphin, and as it was ultimately labeled, Nintendo
GameCube.  Nintendos next-generation console has not yet been formally introduced to
the anticipating living rooms of gamers around the world.  Nevertheless, its tumultuous,
furthermore, intricate life-story spans for days, months, and even years.  This is the
conception and birth of a console, over two years in the making. A console that is
patiently awaiting the day its at last free to capture the minds of video gamers, not movie
nuts, internet junkies, or technological connoisseurs, but the minds of gamers -- gamers
exclusively.  Sit back and make yourself comfortable because this is going to be a
rollercoaster of nostalgic proportions...the creation of a gaming experience that has only
begun ascending the hill of magnificence.</p>

<h3>Your Ticket to the Past: 1998</h3>

<p>Having just released its Dreamcast console in Japan, Sega is now preparing for its
September 9th launch in the United States.  Meanwhile, Sony is working feverishly
behind the scenes to obtain a prototype of its PlayStation 2 along with urging its hype
train into maximum speed.  Secretly, another une<b>X</b>pected competitor is
preparing for the very same thing...</p>

<p>Nintendo, however, has never been one to follow anothers lead.  This is strikingly
apparent with its minimal dispensing of information.  Youll notice as we begin in late
1998, information pertaining to the N2000 is far from significant.  This trend even
continues somewhat to the present...  Now, imagine existing back in 1998 and having to
wait over month at a time for something, anything -- yearning for a simple, yet fresh piece
of news.  Its an unbearable drought even the inhabitants of New Mexico would shudder
imagining.  Luckily, you need but scroll down a few pages to jump from December 1998
to November 2001.  A word of warning to the reader.  N-Sider.com made its debut in
August of 2000 and as a result, we do not have an archive that dates back beyond that
opening date.  The following is mainly an attempt to fill that void, however, its also here
for your reference, you the reader.  Unless youre new to the GameCube realm, I wouldnt
suggest this as a read.  Its not likely to be of any interest to you.  This is for those of you
whom havent a background on such things as the name Project Dolphin, rumors such as
$99, or partnerships such as Mobile 21.  You are the individuals whom will get more out
of this than anyone else.  And so it begins...</p>

<h3>A New Beginning</h3>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/minoruarakawa.jpg" width="150"
height="151" align="right">It all begins in late 98, with Nintendo of America president,
Minoru Arakawa sitting down for a casual interview with Japanese Financial Newspaper,
Nihon Keizai Shimbun...</p>

<p>In this interview, Minoru Arakawa confirms that Nintendo is in fact, adamantly
working on a new console, but tells us not to expect it until the year 2000 or 2001.</p>

<p>When questioned about the N200Xs media format, Arakawa asserted that <i>"It is
by no means certain that the next console will use cartridge ROM, as with the N64. 
Naturally, we are currently researching all types of media to determine what is most
suitable, including DVD."</i></p>

<p>This was the most highly debated topic at the time since, in comparison with the Sony
PlayStation, the Nintendo 64s failure, or at the very least its lack of dominance, was
directly blamed on Nintendos choice of the cartridge media.  As its been said, the costly
format of the cartridge deterred innumerable third party developers from creating games
for Nintendo.  Instead, many developers such as Konami, Square, and Capcom opted for
Sonys option of a safer and less expensive format.  Nintendo surely wants to avoid a
similar fate with the N200X.</p>

<h3>98 - February 1999</h3>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/n2000.jpg" width="183" height="137"
align="right">During these months of non-existent information, speculation is flowing
rampant and imaginations are running wild.  A group of creative, yet scandalous
individuals began creating concept art.  A variety of images were created to either give
the creators perception of how the N2000 might appear, or in most cases, to simply fool
gullible minds into believing them to be authentic.</p> 

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/fakemariokart1.jpg" width="228"
height="175" align="left">Doctored images of the next Mario and Mario Kart games
appeared, along with concept art of the N2000 system itself -- ranging from N64 hybrids
to brain implants.  Perhaps not exactly brain plants, but there were some pretty wacky
ones out there.  Surrounding the text are a few of these images.</p>

<h3>March 1999</h3>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto reveals information about the next iteration in the Mario Bros.
series.</p>  

<p><font size="-1"><i>"For the next Mario, I hope to include far more animation effects.
I hope Mario and Luigi can be on the screen at the same time. That requires quick access
of the ROM cartridge,"</i> Miyamoto reiterates. <i>"From a third-party standpoint,
maybe it might make more economical sense to move to non-ROM-cartridge based
systems in order to hedge the risk of costs. We are not seeing more increased memory
capacity for the RAM to be included in the new console systems. So, if we can use this
huge RAM capacity very effectively, games that are now being played on ROM may be
able to be played on non-cartridge systems. But we haven't decided on anything yet. I am
in no position to talk about the medium for the next-generation system."</i></font></p>

<p> Somewhat cryptic in his response, however Shigeru definitely knows whats going
on behind the scenes.  Rabid Albino Penguins in the next Mario?  You bet.</p>

<h3>March 3, 1999</h3>
<p>Nintendos first publicized mention of its successor to the Nintendo 64 takes place a
day after Sony's announcement of the PlayStation 2.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/howardlincoln.jpg" width="200"
height="296" align="left">Nintendo of America Chairman, Howard Lincoln, attends a
conference located in Italy, composed entirely of third-party publishers.  During this
conference, Lincoln states Nintendos intent on releasing specifications and tools for
N2000 by the conclusion of 1999.  He also confirms that the new hardware is being
developed by Art-X, a company founded by ex-employees of whom also worked on the
N64.   Finally, Lincoln assures the N2000 will avoid cartridges, and instead utilize a
separate storage format.  The exact format is not specified.</p>

<p>Various developers, including <a href=http://www.left.com/>LeftField
Productions</a>, are said to be in the initial planning stages of software development for
N2000.  For a little perspective on the situation, LeftField will complete development on
its last N64 title in May of 2000.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/retrologo1.jpg" width="250" height="65"
align="right">Nintendo invests an unspecified amount of money into Austin, Texas
developer <a href=http://www.retrostudios.com/retro.htm>Retro Studios</a>.  Retro
Studios was established on December 1, 1998 by Jeff Spangenberg.  Nintendo is funding
the creation of a state-of-the-art facility for Retro Studios, which will contain Austins
first local motion-capture equipment and an in-house recording studio.  Retro Studios
offices will officially open in June -- next month.  Retro Studios has a number of games
in development that will appear exclusively on Nintendos next-generation console, from
role-playing, to sports, to action and adventure.</p>

<h3>March 1999</h3>

<p>A Game Developers Conference is held in San Jose, CA.  Renowned game-designer
Shigeru Miyamoto, is there to answer questions prompted by <a
href=http://www.ign.com>IGN64.com</a> about his current involvement in
N2000.</p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>"I'm the kind of person who starts with various experiments and I
cannot, therefore, just say which game is going to be for a specific console.  Right now,
I'm busy working on the controller for the next-generation machine."</i></font></p>

<p>Furthermore, with the news that Nintendo would no longer be going the route of
cartridges, Miyamoto is asked whether or not he is worried about the load times that may
affect gameplay.</p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>"You have a good point there,"</i> Miyamoto admits. <i>"The
system may become greater and faster, but the contents of the software will also become
greater. If we can make use of the extra power in a very smart fashion, I think we can
come up with great new solutions around this problem."</i></font></p>

<p>Irate Static Sticks are known to fix any ol household problem...</p>

<h3>May 4, 1999</h3>
<p>Now defunct Nintendo website, <a
href=http://www.operation2000.com</a>OperatioN2000</a> was first to pick up on this
information.  Internally, Nintendo's next-generation hardware is officially being referred
to under the codename of <b>Project Dolphin</b>.</p> 

<p>Consequently, Nintendo fanboys begin adamantly eating dolphin-safe tuna fish.</p> 

<p>Developers Rareware, Retro Studios, EAD and Nintendo of America's internal studio,
Nintendo Software Technology, are all rumored to be in preliminary stages of software
development for Project Dolphin.  One individual close to Nintendo remarks saying,
<i>"The buzz is that the system is a lot easier to program for than the Nintendo 64."</i> 
This is around the time people begin calling the Dolphin the anti-64, since Nintendo is
beginning to address many of the problems associated with the Nintendo 64.</p>

<h3>May 6, 1999</h3>
<p>Nintendo announces that it will be publishing nearly 13 Disney-licensed games based
on the Mickey Mouse franchise across the Nintendo 64, Color Game Boy and its Project
Dolphin platforms.  The games will be developed by <a
href=http://www.rareware.com>Rare</a> with releases spread out through the next
three years.  One of the thirteen titles is said to have a release in mind for Project
Dolphin.</p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>"The incomparable ability of Rare to create interactive magic is
about to be integrated with the incomparable appeal of Mickey Mouse,"</i> comments
NoA Chairman, Howard Lincoln. <i>"The results will broaden the appeal of video
gaming to an ever-widening number of households around the world."</i></font></p>

<p> Somewhat underwhelming for being the first (un)officially announced title for the
Dolphin.</p>

<h3>May 12, 1999</h3>
<p>Nintendos Electronic Entertainment Expo pre-show occurs today in Los Angeles,
CA.  This marks Nintendos first official US Dolphin announcement.  In front of a crowd
of investors, developers, and media, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln,
speaks confidently about the company's next-generation hardware.</p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>Let me raise the curtain just a little on Nintendo's next home
video game system. One that we are targeting for worldwide launch at the end of year
2000.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Howard officially announces, <i>The code-name for this product is
"Dolphin." That's not the name of the product, but I'll use the Dolphin name this
afternoon when I refer to our new hardware system.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>While our new Dolphin hardware will be extremely powerful, it
will not be expensive. It will retail at a mass market price for home video game
systems.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>"I am absolutely confident Dolphin will equal or exceed anything
that our friends over at Sony can come up with with PlayStation 2," says Howard Lincoln
with confidence. "It will be fast, powerful and inexpensive."</i></font></p>

<p>Nintendo has formed an alliance with Japanese-based electronics giant Matsushita in
order to, not only provide the software medium and copyright protection for Project
Dolphin, but to also create a platform containing the Project Dolphin technology that will
enable users to play movies, music, as well as games.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/marioibm2.jpg" width="160" height="120"
align="right">Nintendo also reveals a multi-year $1 billion technology agreement with
IBM to support Nintendo's next home video game console.  The announcement highlights
IBMs intent to make Project Dolphin the first videogame system to incorporate IBM's
cutting-edge copper chip technology.  IBM will design and manufacture a unique 400
MHz central processor featuring IBM's industry-leading 0.18 micron copper
technology.</p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>"Designing games is an ever-changing process, and this chip with
its speed and seamless data flow, will allow us to make even more amazing games, "</i>
explains Chris Stamper, chairman and technical director of Nintendo developer, Rare.
<i>"Consumers will love the end result with the upcoming system."</i></font></p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>"In my mind, I'd always envisioned what a game like Zelda could
look like, and with the N64, I was able to create it,"</i> describes Shigeru Miyamoto,
<i>"Now, with the Gekko processor, I can see an opportunity to take game designs to a
new level."</i></font></p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/finalgekko.jpg" width="216" height="211"
align="right">Project Dolphins processor chips will be manufactured at IBM's
high-volume manufacturing facility in Burlington, VT, where copper-based processors
have been manufactured and shipped to customers since 1998. IBM remains the only
company to ship products using proven 0.18 micron copper semiconductor
technology.</p>

<p><font size="-1"><i>"There are more technological surprises to come. We'd like to
keep them surprises for you for the time being -- as well as for our competition,"</i>
concludes Lincoln. <i>"And with partners like ArtX, IBM and Matsushita, I know our
results are going to be spectacular.  I think we will do very well in that coming bout. In
fact, we can hardly wait."</i></font></p>

<h3>May 21, 1999</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/neclogo.jpg" width="80" height="22"
align="left">partners with Nintendo Co. Ltd. to manufacture its Project: Dolphin Art-X
designed graphics accelerator.  NEC is also the producer of the <i>PowerVR</i> chipset
used in Sega's Dreamcast.  The deal with Nintendo, however, marks NEC's first real
commercial business for eDRAM, says NEC's associate vice president, systems
integration, Junshi Yamaguchi, <i>"And if it goes well we will expand eDRAM to use in
networking and other applications, so we are making the Nintendo project a strategic
priority."</i></p>
<p>NEC is currently in the testing stages for its eDRAM technology and has its work cut
out to finalize the manufacturing process in time for Nintendo's deadlines.</p>  

<h3>May 25, 1999</h3>
<p><a href=http://www.eet.com/>EE Times</a> reports that Nintendo is adamant
about making its Project Dolphin console copyright protected.  <i>We did not want to
use CD-ROM,"</i> said Hiroshi Yamauchi, president of Nintendo Co. Ltd.  <i>"We
concluded that DVD is the best medium for software distribution, and is the reason we
are allied with Matsushita (Panasonic)."</i></p>
<p>Japanese based Matsushita was the leader in developing the Contents Scramble
System (CSS), a DVD disk scramble/encryption technology that prevents illegal copying
of DVD-Video. Nintendo considered Matsushita's existing technology, however Nintendo
was dissatisfied with the level of the current CSS.  To meet Nintendo's more restrictive
copy-protection requirements, Matsushita has been commissioned to develop an
enhanced copy-protection system for Nintendo's Project Dolphin game disk.</p> 
<p>It is still not known whether or not Project: Dolphin will have the ability to play DVD
movies.</p>

<h3>May 30, 1999</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/panasoniclogo.jpg" width="141"
height="50" align="right"><a href=http://www.nintendojo.com/>Nintendojo</a>
reports that The Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. (Panasonic) and the Universal Music
Group have jointly established a company in the United States to produce digital
videodiscs (DVDs).</p>
<p>The joint company will be called <i>Matsushita Universal Media Services LLC of
America</i> and will begin production at Universal Music's compact disc plant in
autumn, with monthly output planned at 600,000 discs.</p> 
<p>Its not known, with the recent alliance between Nintendo and Matsushita, whether or
not this new plant opening will be one of the locations where Nintendo's DVD titles for
Project Dolphin will be manufactured.</p> 

<h3>June, 1999</h3>

<p>Rumors begin circulating around the net relating to the target launch price of Project
Dolphin.  Some are stating the console to be in the range of 20,000 - 22,000 yen
($170-$187), while others are giving the more ridiculous number of $99.</p>

<p><a href=http://www.ign.com>IGN</a> states that during a company conference
held in its homeland of Japan, Square Co. Ltd. admitted that it is currently evaluating
Nintendos Project Dolphin and that it is very interested in creating software for
additional platforms besides Sony's PlayStation 2.  Hoping Square would someday return
to Nintendo has become a tradition for many Nintendo fans.  Hoping...its about the
extent it will ever reach.</p>

<p>Howard Lincoln comments on Nintendos intent to provide a smooth transition
between Nintendo 64 and Project Dolphin saying, <i>I think Nintendo is pretty
experienced in transitions like this - weve done it a number of times.  I think we do a
very good job with the back half of hardware cycles.  Part of that is pricing, but the other
part of it is that we continue to make good software and support the system until it
reaches the end of its natural life.</i></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the smooth transition Howard speaks of fails to fully materialize.  As
the last big titles are released within the next year including Majoras Mask, Perfect Dark,
and Conkers Bad Fur Day, nearly a year of desolation lies between Nintendo 64s last
dying breath and Project Dolphins eventual launch.</p>

<h3>June 22, 1999</h3>
<p><a href=http://www.forbes.com>Forbes.com</a> conducts an interview with
Nintendo chairman, Howard Lincoln.</p>

<p><font size="-1"><b>FORBES:</b> With the Dolphin, though, you are entering a new
phase in the positioning of the company. Nintendo has always been perceived as a
company whose hardware and software have been primarily positioned at children, with
an emphasis on breezy games and cute characters--like Mario Bros., Pokemon and
Donkey Kong--that appeal to the youngest skew of the video gaming audience. But it
seems that Nintendo is turning away from this long-standing attitude.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Howard Lincoln:</b>Yeah, I think it's true. Nintendo has been
perceived as focusing on a younger demographic. But we're going to take advantage of
the fact that the audience for games has expanded. Adults who played <i>Mario
Bros.</i> when they were kids are looking for more sophisticated games now that they've
grown up.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">They still love and appreciate the Nintendo brand, so we're working
with developers and our own marketing and product development people to create a
whole new range of titles that will spread out our audience. For example, we've got the
<i>Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace Racing</i> game that's sure to attract
kids as well as adults, and of course we're launching our <i>Nintendo Sports</i> group,
and a lot more.</font></p>

<p>We all know what happened to Nintendo Sports.  What it did accomplish was not
very much.</p>

<p> The kiddy stereotype existed for the majority of Nintendo 64s life.  People are
already categorizing Nintendos Project Dolphin as the 64s double, even though it has
yet to even find its way on the market.  An extremely unfair judgment, especially at such
an early time.</p>

<h3>July 7, 1999</h3>

<p>In this months issue of Next Generation Magazine, Nintendo of America Chairman,
Howard Lincoln, blatantly states, <i>"You will not be able to play audio CDs on
Nintendo's machine, and you will not be able to play movies".</i> He goes on to explain
that Nintendo is sincerely a videogame company and as a result, <i>"that's exactly what
our device will do - play the best video games around".</i>  He also states that the
Nintendo Dolphin would feature an aggressive price point.  Next Generation Magazine
goes on to publish an aforementioned rumor stating the Nintendo Dolphin may have a
launch price as low as $99.  Its an absurd idea but many are holding onto the possibility
of it being true.</p>

<h3>July 9, 1999</h3>

<p>Acclaim released its third quarter results today, via a press release. In a section called
"The Holidays and 2000" Acclaim revealed that it is in the early stages of developing
games for the Nintendo Project Dolphin.</p>

<h3>July 14, 1999</h3>

<p>Rabid Square fanboyism continues... During a press event held in Tokyo, Japan,
Square company president Tomoyuki Takechi began his press address by mentioning his
excitement about the games industry in general, especially after the announcement of
Nintendo's Project Dolphin at last May's Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>

<h3>July 3, 1999</h3>
<p>To ensure developers quickly get a hold of Project Dolphin development tools,
Nintendo has partnered with three large US-based software and hardware tool providers. 
Nintendo GameCube <a href=http://members.aol.com/mips36/>News Page</a> has the
info.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Applied Microsystems, Corp.</b> (AMC), based in Redmond,
WA, has been selected to design and manufacture the critical development hardware
developers will use to create Dolphin games. AMC is a recognized leader in
manufacturing development tools for embedded systems for the avionics,
Internetworking, and telecommunications industries.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Metrowerks,</b> based in Austin, the leading provider of
software development tools for the PowerPC architecture of which the Gekko processor
is an extension. Metrowerks will provide a custom version of its acclaimed CodeWarrior
software development tools which will enable developers to create Dolphin game
software using popular programming languages.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Factor 5</b> a game and tools developer, based in San Rafael,
CA, which garnered many accolades for the audio in Nintendo 64's best-seller Star
Wars(R): Rogue Squadron(tm), will provide audio and music development tools for
Dolphin developers. Factor 5's MusyX(tm) Audio Tools product is highly efficient and
offers the most advanced sound creation methods ever devised for interactive media.
Factor 5's MusyX(tm) Audio Tools also feature an approved Dolby(Note A) Surround
sound real-time encoder, adding the most advanced 3D audio to Nintendo games when
played with a Dolby Surround decoder.</font></p>

<h3>July 30, 1999</h3>
<p><a href=http://www.mcvuk.com/>MCV</a> reports a rumor in which they state
that their sources say Shigeru Miyamoto is working on a multiplayer game for Project
Dolphin that will support around 1,000 players simultaneously on a single server.  The
game is said to utilize online chat and e-mail capabilities.  Last but not least, the source
says its likely to be an RPG.</p>
<p>How much truth does this rumor hold?  In all likelihood...none.</p>
<h3>August 2, 1999</h3>
<p>The possibility of Mario arriving at launch arises.  Marios creator, Shigeru
Miyamoto, has a few comments to add.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><i>"Whenever new hardware comes out, Mario has to play the
leading part as the console's top batter -- that's why he has to exercise a lot,"</i> reveals
Miyamoto. <i>"Right now, he's getting in shape for the Dolphin. "You'll see a completely
new side of Mario on Dolphin. Don't you agree that in recent times, both Mario and Luigi
have become a little too cutesy? I feel like it is time that they became a bit more
grown-up. That's where the Dolphin comes in. For example, right now, Mario always
does the Victory sign with his fingers. I think that's a little too childish now. For the
Dolphin version, I'd like to replace the V sign with an entirely new pose."</i></font></p>
<p>The Nintendo Project Dolphin is expected to launch in the fall of 2000.  However,
Nintendo is known for its delays...final is never final.  Nintendo can lay it out plainly and
say its the final date and still change it at the last minute.  To prevent frustration, this is
something Nintendo fans need to learn early on.</p> 

<h3>August 30, 1999</h3>
<p>Nintendos yearly Spaceworld show occurs today.  A show to award gamers, giving
the casual public the chance to play soon to be released Nintendo software.</p>
<p>During Spaceworld, <a href=http://www.ign64.com>IGN64.com</a> prompted a
series of responses from Shigeru Miyamoto, first asking the question, <i>when would
Nintendo show something more concrete on Project Dolphin -- namely first technical
demos?</i>  The response given...</p>
</p><i>After Sony has disclosed every specification for PlayStation 2.</i></p>
<p>According to Miyamoto, a preliminary version of the controller has been completed,
but is being reworked in order to satisfy different sized hands around the world.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><i>"There is a controller,"</i> Miyamoto told <a
href=http://www.ign.com>IGN64</a>.  <i>"But it's under modification now and it's
not the time to show you. The major problem is that the Japanese user says the N64
controller is too big and the American user says it's appropriate."</i></font></p> 

<h3>August 30, 1999</h3>
<p><a href=http://www.bloomberg.com/welcome.html>Bloomberg</a> receives word
from one of its sources, of whom states that Nintendo is in the process of developing a
32-bit Game Boy to replace the current 8-bit version, a move also expected by industry
watchers. Public relations manager Ken Toyoda said <i>"there's a limit to what you can
do with an 8- bit processor, and the speed of 32-bit technology means you can make
much better games."</i> Shigeru Miyamoto has stated in the past that you may be able to
link the Project Dolphin with the Game Boy.</p>
<p>Nintendo is all about innovation.  This is simply one of those ideas where the
possibilities are endless.</p>
<h3>August 31, 1999</h3>
<p>Now that Final Fantasy VIII has been completed for a while, Hironobu Sakaguchi, the
Square Soft employee who is at the heart of Final Fantasy, has been focusing his attention
on the upcoming Final Fantasy movie. During an interview with GameWeek, issue 27,
Hironobu manages to mention Nintendos Project Dolphin.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>GW:</b> What do you know about Nintendo's Dolphin? Any
chance of we'll see a Final Fantasy IX or X on it?<br> 
<b>HS:</b> When is Dolphin coming out?</font></p> 
<p><font size="-1"><b>GW:</b> Nintendo says 2000, but most people are predicting
2001.<br> 
<b>HS:</b> If you were to see a Final Fantasy game on Dolphin, it would have to be FF
X if Dolphin is coming out in 2001.</font></p> 
<p><font size="-1"><b>GW:</b> So if there were a FF IX, we could see it possibly on
Dolphin in the US?<br>
<b>HS:</b> I do not know much about the specs of the machine. If the Dolphin is a
good machine, there would definitely be a possibility of Square Soft making games for
it.</font></p>
<p>...and the fanboys gobbled this one up.</p>
<h3>October 7, 1999</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/mobile21logo.jpg" width="193"
height="91" align="left">Game Boy Advance is officialy announced and along with the
announcement, the news that a joint company between Konami and Nintendo will be
formed to utilize the like-up abilities of the Game Boy Advance and Project Dolphin. 
The new company, named <i>Mobile 21</i>, will develop exclusive content for the
Nintendo Dolphin that takes advantage of the connection capability between Game Boy
Advance. Initial staff members of the new company will come from both Nintendo and
Konami, totaling 70 in the end. The Game Boy Advance is tentatively set to release
before the end of 2000 in North America.</p> 

<h3>September 8, 1999</h3>
<p><a href=http://www.businesswire.com>Business Wire</a> reveals the news that
Nintendo and  ArtX today announced that MoSys' patented 1T-SRAM technology will be
used in the Nintendo Dolphin to embed large, high-performance-memory directly onto
the system's graphics chip, of which is being developed by ArtX, Inc. The new RAM
technology provided is optimized to work with the .18 micron copper technology to be
used in the Dolphin.</p>
<p><i>"Simply stated, the incredible performance of MoSys 1T-SRAM memory with the
proprietary custom graphics chip designed by ArtX is the perfect match for IBM's custom,
copper-based CPU,"</i>says Howard Lincoln, chairman, Nintendo of America Inc.
<i>"We will employ this technology to surpass the game experience offered by any
competing console or personal computer."</i></p>

<h3>September 21, 1999</h3> 

In an interview with MCV, Shigeru Miyamoto makes it known that his worries about
using DVD are abating.  <i>"For the way I make games, cartridges are best. And I still
believe that many companies don't appreciate the advantages of the format,"</i> he told
<a href=http://www.mcvuk.com>MCV</a>. <i>"DVD makes developing less risky for
third parties. But because we can install larger RAM at a lower cost on Dolphin, the
medium is similar to cartridges."</i></p> 
<p>Miyamoto also spoke out on the anti-piracy issue for Project Dolphin. <i>"Cartridges
are a better prevention for piracy,"</i> Miyamoto recognizes.  <i>"But our hardware
development teams will make Dolphin less susceptible to counterfeiting too."</i></p> 
<p>Its all been heard before, cant hurt to hear it again.</p>

<h3>September 27, 1999</h3> 
<p>During a press conference held in Japan, the chairman of US Matsushita Electronics
made it know that there are <b>no</b> plans to release a Panasonic branded Dolphin in
North America. In Japan however, there <i>will</i> be two Dolphin consoles -- one
made by Nintendo and another sold under the Matsushita brand name.</p> 
<p>The Matsushita branded console is supposedly the version capable of playing DVD
movies. It is still not known if Nintendos version of Project Dolphin will play DVD
movies.</p>
<p>Matsushita has definitely kept its word on this one.</p>
<h3>September 29, 1999</h3>
<p>3DO confirms to <a href=http://www.ign64.com>IGN64.com</a> its interest in
developing for Project Dolphin.</p>
<p><i>"Nintendo has said that it is going to start supplying Project Dolphin development
systems to us in a few months,"</i> says 3DO president, TripHawkins. <i>"Right now
we're thinking about it pretty actively in terms of what we've like to do, but we haven't got
the development systems yet."</i></p>
<p><i>"Looking ahead to Dolphin, it's very exciting because as a DVD-format machine it
will be a lot easier for us to think big and make games without constraints,"</i> said
Hawkins.</p>
<p>When asked if he believed Nintendo would make its projected fall 2000 release date
for Dolphin, Hawkins commented: <i>"Historically, Nintendo has shipped in Japan and
come back a full year later to ship in the US, but it doesn't necessarily have to do that
every single time."</i></p> 

<h3>September 30, 1999</h3>
<p>Nintendo and S3(R) Incorporated today announced a partnership to employ S3's
industry-leading graphics technology on Nintendo's next home video game console,
code-named 'Dolphin.'</p>
<p>Dolphin is the first home video game console in the world to embed S3's advanced
texture compression technology right onto the graphics chip. The results will include
elimination of blurriness, blockiness and monotonous repetition of the same elements on
screen. Furthermore, S3 will help to make indistinguishable the lines that separate art
from photography, fantasy from reality.</p> 
<p><font size="-1">"In just the past few years, the graphic improvement in video games
has been stunning. S3 will be a major force in accelerating the performance we'll achieve
on Dolphin," explained Howard Lincoln, Chairman, Nintendo of America Inc. "With
their unique graphics compression technology, developers will be able to provide players
with more complex and colorful graphics. Coupled with our previously announced
strategic agreements with companies like IBM, Matsushita, ArtX and MoSys,
incorporation of S3 technology will make Dolphin a console without equal."</font></p>
<p>Using S3's texture compression technology allows Dolphin developers to compress
texture data to one-sixth its normal size while maintaining or improving the image quality
of the original artwork. Larger and more detailed textures will now require less memory
and reduced load time.</p>
<p>A bunch of technical moo-moo.  Considering going into the dairy business...</p>
<h3>October 6, 1999</h3> 
<p>A source inside Factor 5 has confirmed Thornados existence as a future Project
Dolphin software title.  Preliminary development on Thornado began in 1997 as it was
initially planned for the N64. Factor 5 has supposedly scrapped its N64 Thornado plans,
and instead will make it for the Nintendo Dolphin.</p> 
<p>Thornado is disguised as a 3D shooter but is an action title combined with
exploration.  Its sometimes compared to Metroid and Contra. The game's title refers to
the player's ability to use wind-based weapons that have the destructive power to blow
enemies and obstacles out of the way.</p>
<h3>October 17, 1999</h3>
<p>NextGen Magazine, issue Nov. 99, gets Shigeru Miyamoto in a head-lock in order to
ask him a few questions about the current projects hes involved in.</p> 
<p><b>NextGen:</b> First off, is Dolphin still the name of the project?</p> 
<p><b>ShigeruMiyamoto:</b> Yes. I am of the opinion that Dolphin can be the actual
official name of the product, but some people disagree with me.</p> 
<p><b>NG:</b> Is there any possibility that you will make the year 2000 launch
date?</p> 
<p><b>SM:</b> Yes, but I think whether or not we can meet the deadline depends on
what kind of games materialize.</p> 
<p><b>NG:</b> Has work begun on games yet?</p>
<p><b>SM:</b> Yes, I am personally involved in a variety of Dolphin projects.</p> 

<h3>October 18, 1999</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/neclogo.jpg" width="80" height="22"
align="left">Corporation announced that it will spend 80 billion yen, or about 761
million dollars to build a new factory to make microchips for the new Nintendo Project
Dolphin game system.</p> 
<p>The order from Nintendo, estimated to be worth around 300 billion yen (US$2.84
billion), is for an advanced graphics LSI chip for the Nintendo Dolphin. Through a state
of the art production process, the chips will be produced to a 0.18 micron rule and include
embedded MoSys 1T-SRAM running at 200 megahertz with a data transfer rate of 3.2
gigabytes.</p>
<p>Make any sense?  No? Dont worry.  Youre not the only one whos lost.</p>
<p>The new plant will deliver 10,000 eight-inch chip wafers per month.  Construction of
the plant will initiate next month, and chip production will begin in August 2000. NEC
senior vice president Kanji Sugihara told reporters at a press conference that <i>"All the
chips made at the new plant will more than likely be sold to Nintendo after it launches its
new game machine."</i></p>

<h3>October 19, 1999</h3>
<p>Nintendo chairman, Howard Lincoln, always ready for another interview, this times
sits down with UK EDGE magazine.  Lincoln explains how Nintendo will focus on a
variety of genres, on top of its world-famous franchises.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><i>"I'm hopeful we will see more RPGs.  One of the things we will
bring to the table that we've been working on with N64, is to increase our market share in
the sports arena.</i> Lincoln makes it known, <i>I think you'll see those not just from
Nintendo but from major third-party publishers as it will be easier to develop for
Dolphin."</i></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">In regards to Internet connectivity for both Dolphin and Game Boy
Advance Lincoln says, <i>"We have not announced an Internet or online gaming strategy
but we have invested a great deal of money and effort in this area over a significant period
of time. It would be a mistake to assume that just because we haven't announced
anything, nothing exists, because that's not true. I think, particularly in the U.S.,
connectivity and online gaming is extremely important, and I think we are spending the
necessary time and effort to see if we can get that right. I had anticipated that we would
have had an announcement sometime just after E3, but things didn't work out, so we're
still working on that."</i></font></p> 
<p>For those of you in the present still doubting that Nintendo doesnt have an online
strategy set-up for its next-generation console, hopefully this two year old reassurance
will help.</p>
<p>In this same issue an interview is conducted with Shigeru Miyamoto, asking how
DVD will make third-party support better.</p>
<p><font size="-1">Miyamoto remarks, <i>"With optical media available, it's going to
present third-party developers and other publishers with the opportunity to invest in our
DVD system with much more ease. I think it's going to present a good business
model."</i></font></p>
<h3>November 5, 1999</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/petermain.jpg" width="155" height="170"
align="left">At a news conference yesterday in New York, Peter Main made a speech to
the gathered crowd.  Game Boy Advance information is given and connectivity use is
hinted at.  The more interesting parts of it are located below.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><i>"Game Boy Advance debuts in Japan in August and in the U.S.
and Europe before the end of the year. A retail cost has not yet been revealed, but it too
will be priced for the mass market. For fun on the run, Game Boy advance will represent
an order of magnitude leap in performance over the current Game Boy Color. With a
32-bit RISC processor and a palette of 65-thousand colors in terms of graphics alone it
will be a far different animal than any other handheld product. And it will accomplish all
this with the same low battery power consumption as our current
technology."</i></font></p> 
<p><font size="-1"><i>"But its biggest point of differentiation comes from its
connectivity. In Japan, when attached by adapter to a cell phone, it will allow owners to
access the Internet, exchange email and download game software to an external memory
device. In the near future, we'll also be announcing some intriguing ways for connecting
Game Boy advance to the Dolphin console."</i></font></p>
<p>Repeated news, however, it is an <i>official</i> repeat.</p>

<h3>November 15, 1999</h3>
<p>In an interview with GameWeek, Michael Pole of EA Sports had a few kind words
for Nintendos Project Dolphin.</p>
<p><font size="-1"><i>"We are very excited about Nintendo Dolphin. Just a few weeks
ago, Mr. Arakawa and Howard Lincoln were here at the EA offices. We are talking with
them, and we spend a lot of time with our partners at Nintendo. I have heard a lot of
wonderful things about the Dolphin, and from a product-development point of view we
will be looking forward to supporting the system."</i></font></p>
<p>Kind words or harsh words, either way, they are both better than no word at all. 
Especially what Sega received from EA, simply a flat out neglection.  Its not a surpass
though that EA is planning on creating content for Nintendos console as it is one area
Nintendo lacks in.</p>

<h3>December 10, 1999</h3> 
<p>In a recent interview with IGN64, Jim Merrick revealed that it is likely that a
Panasonic brand DVD movie-player version of Dolphin will launch in Japan first and
then eventually make its way to the US. Initially, in both the US and Japan, the Nintendo
Project Dolphin will launch as a game machine only, in order to ensure a low mass
market price and help increase the Dolphins market share.</p>
<p><font size="-1">During the interview, Jim also discussed the positives of the Dolphin
platform compared to the PS2 saying, <i>"I think that the Dolphin system will have areas
that are noticeably stronger than PS2 and there are going to be areas where the two
systems are virtually interchangeable. But it comes down to the games. One of the things
that Nintendo is really is focusing on is ease of development. We want the Dolphin
system to be easy to write for. I want a faster time to market, an easier entry, and I want to
know that people can get the performance out of the system that we know it's capable of.
And that's really our focus. We're a lot more serious about supporting developers; getting
the tools out there and keeping them at a reasonable cost."</i></font></p>
<p>Jim also revealed, for the first time, that Project Dolphin development kits are in the
hands of a number of developers and that those first, second and third party companies
with kits are working hard to create software.</p> 
<p>Jim revealed that more Dolphin technology information will be revealed during the
Game Developers Conference, Milia in France and shortly prior to Sony's launch of
PlayStation 2 in Japan.</p> 
<p>Nintendo is still sticking to its previously announced Project Dolphin launch date of
Holiday 2000.</p>

<p>*cough* BS.</p>

<h3>December 20, 1999</h3>
<p>Its quite apparent everyone loves Miyamoto.  The man is confronted with a new
interview nearly every week.  Im sure it tires on him.  For me on the other hand, I cant
get enough. This one is done by Super PLAY #46 (Sweden).</p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>SP: You have said Mario will be more mature in his Dolphin
debut. Why?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">When I created the character Mario I was 26 years old. I wanted to
make a game I didn't have to be embarrassed to play. Since then several young developers
have come to our team, and they have of course given Mario and his game some
characteristics. So common people think it's for small children. And I absolutely don't
want it to be an adult game, but I don't either want people to be ashamed of playing it.
Lately Mario has been too cutesy in his appearance.</font></p> 
<p><font size="-1"><b>SP: When will Dolphin be launched?</b></font></p> 
<p><font size="-1">One thing's for sure: it will be after PlayStation 2. And that means
we have to create a machine that will be of interest even for those who have bought
Sony's console. Still, without Dolphin games we can't launch the Dolphin. Since I'm
responsible for the game development I could be blamed if the console gets delayed...
Lets hope for the best, but an epic game is well worth the wait. Look for Mario as the
prime indicator of how far along Nintendo Dolphin is.</font></p>
<p>Mario?  Well, Mario is going to be absent for a very long time.  Yep, Id have to say
thats quite the indicator as we wont see Mario for another two years.</p>
<h3>2000...</h3>

<p>So, how did 1999 treat you?  The Nintendo 64 was still putting up a fight however
weak it may have been.  A few unmotivated slaps at Sony here and tap on the chin to
Sega there.  Other than that, Nintendo continued to roll in the profits coming out of the
Game Boy Color.  On the Project Dolphin front, the amount of information we received
from Nintendo was somewhat substantial.  Technology partner announcements left and
right from Factor 5 to IBM.  Nintendo has garnered a lot of technology muscle on its side. 
Thats a definite.  Then there is the Game Boy Advance/Project Dolphin link-up.  A
feature that has the potential of saving Nintendo in the future.  Also there were the
moments in 1999 when Square considered supporting Nintendo [^-^].  No comment there
since weve run that topic into the ground, stomped on it, and then covered it with chunky
gravel and smooth gravy.  In 1999, Nintendo also told us to expect the release of Dolphin
at the conclusion of 2000, but as we know now, that never came to be.  While all news is
not always going to be positive, we know that good things are still to come down the line
in 2000.  The next major announcement from Nintendo comes during Spaceworld 2000. 
But that momentous occasion is going to have to wait until next time...</p>
