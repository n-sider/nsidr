Apparently pleased with their <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1471">previous licensing</a> of Zi Corporation's Decuma handwriting recognition software for the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>, Nintendo has now opted to license Zi's <a href="http://www.zicorp.com/eZiText.htm">eZiText</a> technology to offer predictive text input for Wii.<br />
<br />
eZiText's primary application domain appears to be mobile phones; Zi's own site shows an example of a word being keyed in via number pad presses.  As Wii does not have a number pad, text input will likely take a slightly different form (perhaps directional pad presses, or perhaps Remote gestures), yet still use eZiText to complete the words.<br />
<br />
With this announcement, it seems likely that Wii titles needing text input capabilities will all have a similar interface for this, hopefully making Wii more accessible for all potential players.
