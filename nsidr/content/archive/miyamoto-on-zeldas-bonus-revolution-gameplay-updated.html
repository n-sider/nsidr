<p>After his recent <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1827">knighting in France</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> gave an interview to Nintendo of Europe wherein he confirmed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1755">earlier statements</a> from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> to the effect that upcoming GameCube title <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i></a> will feature bonus Revolution control options when played on Nintendo's upcoming home console.</p>

<p><strike>Specifically, according to <a href="http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=6122">an interview summary</a> at GamesAreFun, Miyamoto said the Revolution controller will be used to shoot the bow & arrow and throw the boomerang, among "other actions".  What these other actions are is as of yet unclear, but it seems quite heavily integrated into the gameplay.  Until Nintendo chooses to reveal more, we'll simply have to wait and see what develops.</strike></p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Miyamoto did, in fact, confirm the use of Revolution control on <i>Princess</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I would say that we are progressing well with completing it," says Miyamoto. "And one of the most important features is that, because Revolution can run GameCube software, when you play Twilight Princess on Revolution you can take advantage of the Revolution controller."</p></blockquote>

<p>However, he did <em>not</em> say anything about how the control would be used, contrary to the above-linked report &mdash; at least not that made it into Nintendo of Europe's interview.  The so-called specifics are coming from a poster on an Internet forum.  Time will tell if they are true or not, but for right now, they carry no official weight.</p>
