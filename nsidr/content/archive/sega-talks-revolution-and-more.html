Nintendo Power has conducted an interview with Simon Jeffrey, president of Sega. In the interview, several Nintendo-related questions are posed including asking Jeffrey about the company's intention to support the Nintendo Revolution.  An excerpt is below while the full interview can be read <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=5acc7ced-d6a4-4494-83d5-f581dbc608fe&page=newsmain">here</a>.

<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>NP:</b> Do you think that those rising costs might lead to even more cross-platform games, and if Nintendo decides to do something radically different with Revolution, is that going to potentially discourage third parties from supporting the platform? Or do you think it might be attractive in terms of trying something different? 
<br><br>
<b>SJ:</b> A bit of both, probably. I think it depends how Nintendo rolls out its third-party relations. Were very excited about the prospects of Revolution, because, like we were talking about earlier, the Nintendo platforms have been great for Sonic and the classic franchises. We think Revolution can absolutely be the same. But I think youre absolutely right. If Nintendo does choose a different model than Sony and Microsoft, then it might be very difficult for some third parties to adopt this three-pronged, multi-platform approach. 
<br><br>
<b>NP:</b> This is kind of a wild idea, but it could be very cool. At E3, Nintendo announced that the Revolution would have the capability to download NES, SNES and N64 games. Would it be at all feasible, do you think, to partner with Nintendo and perhaps add the Sega Genesis to that list? 
<br><br>
<b>SJ:</b> Thats a pretty wild idea. (Laughs.) You should talk to Nintendo about that.
