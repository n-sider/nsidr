Japan's top game developers were recently reviewed (by themselves, no less) in <i>Dorimaga</i>, a publication from the land of the rising sun. Among them was, of course, Hideo Kojima -- his credits include the <i>Metal Gear</i> franchise and <i>Policenauts</i>. When touching on the subject of content for next generation platforms, Kojima seemed adamant in his gravitation toward Revolution, saying that (as a designer) it would be "foolish" to pass up. He added that advancing in areas other than pure technology were imperitive -- a contradiction to what Kojima believes he's known for; a lover of movies.
