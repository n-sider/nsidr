<p>Via Gamasutra comes word that Merrill Lynch has <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10744">raised  their share price target</a> for Nintendo on anticipation for Wii.</p>

<p>The target price was raised from 23,000 yen to 27,000 yen.  At the end of the day when the report was released, Nintendo was trading at a 6.5 year high, up 72% year-to-date and 102% over this time last year.  Nintendo's share price may soon approach its historic 30,000-yen highs from the Super Nintendo era if this trend continues.</p>
