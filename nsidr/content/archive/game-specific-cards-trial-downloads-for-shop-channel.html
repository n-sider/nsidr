Via <a href="http://wii.myrl.net/index.php/topic,52.0.html" target="_blank">this place</a> comes the information on how to disguise your Firefox browser as a Nintendo Wii for some shallow viewing of the Wii Shop Channel. <br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-2985-1.jpg" width="400" height="263" class="image_styled" /><div class="image_caption_styled" style="width: 408px;">The main Wii Shop menu, on Firefox.</div></div><br />
After a little poking around, though, this reporter has found something particularly interesting: some of the potential error messages that are embedded in the source of the page.<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">a[818]  = "The card number you entered can only be used to download specific titles. It is not a Wii Points Card.  Visit support.nintendo.com for assistance."</div><br />
Could this confirm some of the suspicions we've had all along, that game-specific Wii Shop cards might be bundled with full software?  Such a message provides strong evidence that certain smaller games might be bundled with new installments (Super Metroid, perhaps, with Metroid Prime 3, or something to that effect).<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">a[623]  = "You have downloaded this title before, and your trial period has expired. You cannot redownload it.  Visit support.nintendo.com for assistance."</div><br />
This suggests that certain games might be eligible for one-off, time-based trial periods at times in the future, which is also an interesting potential feature.<br />
<br />
Time will tell if either of these scenarios come to pass, but at present it's certainly looking like Nintendo has some of them in mind.
