<p>WHAM! Gaming interviewed Shigeru Miyamoto over the past E3.  An excerpt is below, however be sure to check out the full interview <a href="http://wham.canoe.ca/gcn/2005/05/27/1059582.html">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p><b>You only revealed a little bit about Revolution at your E3 press conference. Are you waiting until next year to really talk about what the machine is all about?</b></p> 
 
<p><b>Shigeru Miyamoto:</b> It's a trade show, and being a trade show we want to focus on what we're doing this year, we want attention on this year's business. However, that being said, we can't not say anything. We want to tell a little bit, so we went and looked at the information and said, 'Well, we can tell them this much.' We don't want to give away too much because other companies out there tend to take that information and run with it, of course. And while it was a small amount of info, we thought it was good info and we were pretty happy with what we were able to tell people. While the Revolution is something we're doing next year, it's going to have all the cutting edge technology, it's going to have a lot of power to it. It's not this big monster machine. What we're trying to use that technology for is to make it a machine that is family-friendly, easily accessible by people of all ages and all experiences. Quiet, small, simple... that's where we're trying to take that technology.</p>
