<p>Sega has done a bit of spring cleaning it seems. In a recent announcement, the company stated that it has appointed a new chairman as well as gotten rid of a few directors. Current president of Sammy (a company that recently purchased a 22.4 percent share in Sega) Hideki Satomi (62 years old) has taken over as Sega's chairman and representative director as of February 17th. Current chairman Hideki Sato will not be leaving entirely though. Instead he will become the vice chairman of the new board.  

<p>For those who haven't been following the story. Sammy, a Japanese pinball machine maker, purchased a 22.4 percent share in Sega from CSK in December 2003, thereby making it the company's dominant share holder. The new president was voted in during a recent board meeting. Also worth noting, with Satomi's appointment has come the resignation of board directors Masahiro Aozono and Makoto Kaneshiro, who were both a part of the former CSK side of Sega.
