<p>To celebrate the 20-year anniversary of the release of the Famicom version of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=235">Super Mario Bros.</a> in Japan, Nintendo today rereleased the Famicom Mini version of Super Mario Bros. as well as released Dr. Mario/Panel de Pon and Mario Tennis Advance.</p>

<p>Of course, Mario is actually 24 years old, having first appeared in Donkey Kong in 1981, but Nintendo won't let a little technicality like that spoil <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/mario20th/index.html">the celebration</a>.</p>
