In case you haven't heard, this past Monday marked the availability of the <i>Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth</i> demo on the U.S. Nintendo Channel.  I meant to write about it then, but life intervened.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6240&view=screens&imgid=6"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3980-1.jpg" width="158" height="119" class="image_styled" /></a></div>I've become something of an <i>Ace Attorney</i> fan over the years, with particular love for <i>Trials and Tribulations</i>, the third game in the series.  <i>Investigations</i> marks a slightly new direction for the series, but though it doesn't have courtroom battles, it's doesn't really feel much like a spinoff game thus far&mdash;more a continuation of the series with a different focus.<br />
<br />
In the demo (which does appear identical to <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/misc/presentations/ace-attorney/index.html">the Flash demo</a>, minus the reported crashiness), which is a more tightly-edited version of the opening several minutes of the full game, a murder occurs in Miles Edgeworth's office, and you'll be introduced to the new Logic system, piecing together thoughts and considerations that arise in the investigation process to create new information.  It's a pretty cool system from what little I've seen of it so far.  I'm a touch concerned that the series' trademark "guess what far-out thing we're thinking, or get penalized" M.O. might shine through as it gets more complicated, but in the meantime, it looks like it's going to be fun.<br />
<br />
We got the full game from Capcom for review yesterday, so look for that after the game officially releases on February 16.
