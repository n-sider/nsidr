I'm having a get-together for select family, friends, and coworkers this Sunday.  It's my own brand of Mario party that doesn't actually involve the so-named series&mdash;instead, we'll be digging in to <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i>.<br />
<br />
I've not said anything about this game here yet, but I've been following it with keen interest since its E3 reveal.  I grew up with the original <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>; I did have chances to play the sequels at friends' homes on NES and SNES, but never actually owned any of them until I, now grown, got into the <i>Super Mario Advance</i> series on the GBA.  But the original still holds a special place in my heart and, as I'm finding, many others' as well... people who I didn't expect.<br />

It's interesting to see people both younger and older than I light up when I bring up <i>NSMBW</i>.  Some of them did keep up with Mario throughout his 2-D adventures, others didn't really get past the first.  But all of them know how to run, jump, and throw fireballs.  From an impact perspective, <i>SMB</i> was NES's <i>Wii Sports</i>.  It may have been one of a scant few games owned for a NES; it was one of only a half-dozen or so in my own childhood home... but even if the collection was much thicker, <i>SMB</i> remained one of the most memorable titles.<br />
<br />
<i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> is like a childhood dream come true.  I think most of us took turns playing at some point, wondering what it'd be like to be able to play together.  I remember thinking when the original DS <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i> was revealed with its two-player mode... how much fun would that have been to play through the game together with a friend, like we always wanted to do?  It wasn't meant to be then, but here it is now.<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to my own Mario party this coming Sunday.  I wasn't at E3, so I haven't laid hands on the game yet; it'll be new to me too.  As new as Mario can be, at least.  If you're having a similar deal, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=40&view=contact">tell me</a> how it went.  I'd love to hear your stories.  <br />

Just two days left.  Here we go!
