Ubisoft said it will forego releasing <i>Lunar: Dragon Song</i> for the Nintendo DS in Europe, according to GamesIndustry.biz.  <i>Lunar: Dragon Song</i> is currently scheduled for release in North America under Ubisoft in September 2005.  The title is being developed by Japan Art Media and GameArts and the game's story is said to take place 1,000 years before the original <i>Lunar: Silver Star</i>.  There is currently no word on whether <i>Lunar: Dragon Song</i> will find another publisher for release in Europe.
