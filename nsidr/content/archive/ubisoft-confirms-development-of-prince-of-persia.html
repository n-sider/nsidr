<p>Following Ubisoft's big <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2325">software announcement</a> last week, comes word the company is developing Prince of Persia for Wii.  There are no further details on the game although speculation points to it being either a remake or compilation of former titles specially tailored for use with the Wii remote control.</p>

<p>An Ubisoft spokesperson told IGN, "I can confirm that a game based on the popular Prince of Persia franchise is one of many titles Ubisoft has in development for Nintendo's Wii. At this time we can not provide an official date for the game or any additional information about it."</p>

<p>Last week Ubisoft revealed it would support the launch of the Wii later this year with seven titles.  That list includes Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII, Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Open Season, Rayman Raving Rabbids, Red Steel.</p>
