<p>The latest comic from <a href="http://www.vgcats.com/comics/">VGCats</a> highlights some of the terror caused through the ages by the innocent in appearance species known as Gyroids.  No, they aren't coffee table decorations.  We first met these creatures in Animal Crossing for Nintendo GameCube and have been hypnotized by their elaborate dance moves since.  It seems the guys at VGCats have also dug up some history on their origin.</p>

<p><blockquote><font size="2">
"The gyroids are based on haniwa, which are clay dolls that the ancient Japanese used to mark dead people's tombs way back in oh, let's say the fifth century or thereabouts. Which basically means that your entire animal Crossing town is built on top of a one-and-a-half-millenia-old graveyard, and the creepy dancing statues you dig up are actually creepy dancing funerary relics, which, I can only assume, are haunted by the restless and vengeful spirits of those whose graves they once adorned.<br><br>

Say what you will about Nintendo's squeaky-clean image. I only wish I could say Animal Crossing was the only Nintendo game where the ampant desecration of graves is a popular pastime. Now where did I put that shovel...?"

<p>Gyroids are experts in a variety of dance including ballet, tap, jazz, boogie, salsa, tango, foxtrot, waltz, rumba, and bop.  Please beware, or you'll get yourself 'served'.</p>
