<h4>Feburary 22nd, 2001</h4>

<p>In your 02-06-01 Q&A, someone asked if there had ever been a Sega game on any of Nintendos consoles. Your answer was that you weren't axactly sure.
 
<p>Well here's a few pics of the this game where both Mario and Sonic appear!
Mario only seems to be in the game as a "halfway point" He's usually in a cage and when you free him, he shouts "Mariio" When you die, you restart from where you found him.

<p><b>Pete: Well I probably saw it a magazine then. Maybe Sonic will decide to drop in on the next <i>Mario Kart</i> or <i>Smash Brothers</i> game?</b>

<p>Has Capcom said anything about or hinted at the possibility of some 2-D Mega Man games coming to the Cube? Or maybe GBA? Mega Man would be perfect for GBA..  How about an SNK vs Capcom online game ?   I've been hoping for some online SF action for a long time.
 
<p>-Nintendophile

<p><b>Pete: Well there's <i>MegaMan EXE</i>, which obviously might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm looking forward to it. I think Capcom will bring their famous blue bomber to both Nintendo's next-gen systems in various titles. <i>Cannonspike 2</i> wouldn't be so bad either.</b>

<p>I Would like to comment on the recent news of Metroid Cubed being turned into a f&*(#ing FPS!!!!!!!!!  What the hell is Nintendo doing????  Are they rushing the game so it will be ready for launch date b/c why in the world would someone want to make a Metroid game a first person shooter?  Do they not know how much fundamentals of previous Metroid games will be lost?  All items accpet for freeze guns ect.  will be lost...no more morph ball b/c it will look stupid in first person, no more platforming b/c as every knows that sucked in Turok, no more Grapple Hook...ect ect.


<p><b>Pete: Yes, there's been *a lot* of feedback to the news of <i>Metroid</i> being a FPS title. I say, relax, and wait for E3. If the game looks terrible there, well feel free to unleash the hounds.</b>

<p>When you ran the story about Joanna Dark possibly not being in PD2, I immediately thought about Rare's habit of trying to make me hate them... or something.  In other words, I think they're just messing with our minds because they're sick and twisted over there.
 
<p>Anyway, do you think Jo will make a return appearance or not?

<p>-NBKnMO

<p><b>Pete: I think if Rare does choose to stick with the <i>Perfect Dark</i> universe for a sequel, you'll probably have a different heroine or hero, similar to what Rare did with <i>Donkey Kong Country 2</i>. But they could also choose to go in a totally different direction as well. <i>Perfect Dark</i> was popular enough (it will probably sell about 2 million copies worldwide), but Rare might want to explore totally new characters and environments for their next FPS project.</b>

<p>Will the recent layoffs at Retro Studios cause a delay and problems with the launch? Will Nintendo lose momnetum with Metroid development? Are there a number of major titles to be launched with the Gamecube?

<p>-David E.

<p><b>Pete: I think <i>Metroid</i> won't see a 2001 release. I never thought it would, but with the recent staff shuffles, now it's looks even more unlikely. The good news is Retro has put their best staff on two projects -- <i>Metroid</i> and their fantasy online RPG. I always thought five to six projects was way too much for a start up studio to be tackling. Two projects should be a lot more manageable, and focus Retro's best talent where it's needed.</b>

<p>Do you think Nintendo could port the never released Star Fox 2 to GBA?

<p>-John A.

<p><b>Pete: That's not a bad question, actually. Perhaps they could retool the graphics a bit to take advantage of the GBA chipset and release the game, as the engine and levels designs are supposedly quite complete.</b>

<p>What's with all the people saying that the Gamecube doesn't have the cool factor like the ps2 as far as looks.  Well, I don't know about you, but I can think of nothing cooler than walking into Software etc. and carrying out a 8 cm. disk in my hand.  They look so cool when there that small!  Almost futuristic.  Also the Gamecube will be very durable if Nintendo put a handle on it.  That means they want you to carry it around.  Thanks

<p>-Andrew B.

<p><b>Pete: I agree. GameCube's discs have a very high-tech and science-fiction "look" to them. The design of the GameCube really has to be seen in person to appreciate what it is. Picture a standard mens shoe box. Now divide that into four and you get an idea how small this machine is.</b>

<p>Hey guys great site, I think Nintendo's got the absolute best sort of
kit setup now with the GCN Advance GB, but all is lacking now is to some
how  market Nintendo as cool, like the Playstation is marketed.  The
Magazine that support the Nintendo formats are either too kiddish or not
as styled/clean cut as the playstation mags.  

<p>My point if the games
media industry start portraying Nintendo (i.e. guys like yourselves or
supporting magazines) as cool through stylish hip sort of magazine
covers with a 'stylish/cool design' and outlook, this should broaden the
Nintendo Look to other mature gamers. And the influence the gaming media
supporting a format have can change the outlook of the format. Yes, I
Know the system should have mature content backing this cause up but
with the right image we might be able to win over game developers that
develop mature gaming content and then the mature gamers?

<p>-Anon

<p><b>Pete: Well, you'll be seeing how far Nintendo is willing to push the envelop in a few days with <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day</i> coming out. I think that game will start to really get
people to stand up and take notice. It really is probably the most shocking and outrageously
sexual console game I've ever seen. I've also thought the marketing for games like <i>Perfect Dark</i> and <i>Conker</i> has been fantastic. The problem is this "switch" to a more diverse lineup happened too late in the N64 lifespan. With the GameCube you will see this kind of product right and marketing right from day 1.

<p>Will Nintendo ever be seen as a strict "cool" company? Probably not. A lot of the appeal with the Nintendo brand is its inherent Disney-esque qualities. That scores Nintendo some major points with kids, parents, and retailers in general. I think it's more of a question of diversifying. Mario and Pikachu will always be there, but there's no reason stuff like <i>Eternal Darkness</i> and <i>Sin & Punishment</i> can't also share the spotlight.</b>

<p>G'day mates I was just wondering when do you think the GCN will be released in Australia?

<p>-Null Null Null

<p><b>Pete: I'm guessing spring 2002, mate.</b>

<p>Great site I just wanted to ask a few questions:

<p>1. When the GBA releases, we as the fans aren't going to have to worry about 
a shortage in hardware like *cough* Sony *cough* ?

<p>2. Will the GBA be able to go online at launch or may be later?

<p>3. Is there maybe just maybe a possiblity there might be a Legend of Zelda 
movie in the works..... maybe a rumor....... maybe?
Well thats all my questions for know anyway keep up the good work!

<p>P.S. Please answer my question

<p>-Jai210

<p><b>Pete:

<p>1.) There will be shortages if Nintendo keeps true to their hardware numbers. Right now, for instance, there are over 3 million retail orders for the GBA in Japan, but Nintendo keeps saying they'll only have 1 million systems for launch. Could they be bluffing? It's possible, but expect this system to fly off store shelves very, very quickly, no matter how fast Nintendo pumps them out.

<p>2.) In Japan there will be cell-phone link functions pretty much from day 1. In the US, where the cell-phone architecture is far less advanced (pardon the pun), chances are there will be no online support for the GBA right away. Then again, NOA is rumored to be bringing <i>Pokemon Crystal</i> to the US, so you never know...

<p>3.) I would love to see a <i>Legend of Zelda</i> movie. I haven't heard anything about that, however.</b>

<p>I just got a Mini-Cd from a Miller Lite box. And it kicks ass! The CD itself
not the contents. It's a cute little size and looks more high tech than a
standard CD. My question however is as follows. Nintendo went with the
Mini-DVD format to prevent pirating. However I searched the web and found
that Mini-DVD-RAM discs are being developed. Do you think this can pose a
threat to Nintendo? Or are they using some other form of copy protection as
well? I Love those Mini-DVDs!!!!!!!!!

<p>-Eddie

<p><b>Pete: Well rewritable mini-DVDs probably won't be nearly as common as full-sized DVD-Rs, so that's just one of the things Nintendo is doing to make piracy difficult. The other reason for the smaller sized discs is apparently Nintendo may use them in some kind of portable device in the future-- and I would imagine this means far into the future, like 2004 or 2005.</b>

<p>A new Zelda game with a possible tilt 'n' tumble functions, highly dubious 
but nonetheless a possibility.

<p>Now imagine a game like Zelda on the Nintendo GameCube with its beautiful 
graphics, lush environments and settings. bump mapping, environment mapping 
just to name a few. Link's shield could also be environment mapped to 
reflect just that and real-time lighting. but what about the controller 
functions.

Here is an idea that I've conjured, Link or the player falls into and is now 
stuck in an underground dungeon, the dungeon is dark with just a little bit 
of light seeping through from the far, out of reach walls. In the distance 
there seems to be a narrow plank with traps conspicuously littered about, 
and right on the end side there is a huge contraption of some sort. upon 
close inspection it seems to be a storage urn to facilitate some sort of 
functionality. Beside the large urn, a large door stands erected to great 
heights. apprehensive indeed since the urns function, should it be solved, 
is what opens this great door. 

<p>Running about the dungeon with little to no 
hope of finding a solution to this dilemma. (The Player) Link sees that, 
right there opposite, in the distant horizon lies another strange looking 
urn. crossing this platform trough the narrow plank whilst diligently 
navigating the traps, to the other platform. Upfront the urn seemed similar 
to the larger one. however, this time the urn has liquid in it. further 
scrutiny shows that the urn has its deceptions, its placed on top of some 
sort of a raised circular stand. It is suspicious indeed, something will 
undoubtedly happened if the urn is moved or lifted. (The player) Link heaves 
up this large urn, which is excessive in weight for his knees to bear.

<p>There 
is a loud mechanical sound echoing in the chambers of the underground 
cavern, coherently this sound confirms that a mechanical device of some sort 
is in effect. Killing one's doubt as the circular stand shoots up from the 
ground. There is that familiar clicking noise informing Link that there is 
no time to loose.

Now here is where the Tilt 'n' tumble feature comes in handy, if it is 
indeed built into the GameCube's controller:
As Link you have to cross this plank with a heavy urn above your head. and 
fill the larger urn with liquid from the smaller urn. using the tilt 
function of the controller one has to balance the urn and the liquid inside, 
being careful as not to spill it. this is done by tilting the GameCube 
controller, leaving the analogue stick on the left for controlling Link and 
the right C-camera sick is used for just that the camera angles.

Making one's way toward the plank seem arduous enough with the tilt 
function, but now the plank has to be crossed, not to mention the devious 
traps which are sure to foil Link's intentions of reaching the other side. 
The player has to carefully tilt the controller since Link has been 
intentionally programmed to become weak as he struggles with the weight of 
the urn. The player has no choice but to deal with this if he is ever going 
to get Link out of such a place. 

<p>Carefully and subtly pushing the analogue 
stick makes Link make his way on the narrow plank, suddenly the Diamond 
shaped eyes appear on the walls, shooting arrays of laser beams as Link is 
in their field of vision. The player has to avoid spilling the liquid filled 
urn with the functionality of the tilt feature, he also has to navigate Link 
using the analogue stick, doing so by avoiding the traps and lastly the 
C-camera stick is used to pan around the cavern, keeping a look out for the 
diamond shaped eyes, to open up. 

<p>This ante's up the challenging factor 
considerably. not to mention the time limit, with four aspects to keep our 
hands busy. but what if the rumble feature comes into play. as Link gets 
tired the controller rumbles more in effect, this then makes the tilt 
function all that much harder to deal with. as the tilt function would vary 
its sensitivity.

<p>Those are just a few of my ideas, which can and could be implemented into 
the GameCube controller. If the tilt function does come into play we will no 
doubt see a new era of games based on this functionality. It is already 
implemented into a new Kirby game on the Gameboy Color.

<p>So what do you think.?

<p>-LF

<p><b>Pete: I really liked that idea about Link having to walk a narrow plank and having to avoid spilling the water. That's kind of neat, actually, heh. Personally I'm not crazy about 
PC tilt joy pads, but if Nintendo can come up with some really unique ideas for the technology, I say go for it.</b>

<p>N-sider,

<p>Do you know what's up with the development agreement between Nintendo,
Rare, and Disney?  According to IGNcube, Rare is under contract to
create 13 Disney-licensed games on Nintendo systems over the next few
years.  So far, I think the only ones we've seen are Mickey's Speedway
USA and its Gameboy equivalent.  It seems unlikely that more are planned
for N64, so it looks like we'll have a huge amount of Rare-developed
Disney games on our GBAs and GameCubes.

<p>While I'm all for Rare getting the large amounts of money that no doubt
comes with this deal, will Rare have any time left to create non-Disney
games?  They're not the most prolific developer in the world, and even
though the GameCube is easy to develop for, eleven more games is a
pretty tall order.  Do you have any more information that could shed
some light on this?

<p>-Abobo

<p><b>Pete: Rare has a big (and I mean big) work force. Chances are a lot of their Disney projects will wind up as low cost Game Boy Advance titles. Don't worry, Rare will have a lot of time and staff for projects like <i>After Dark</i> and <i>Conker's Other Bad Day</i>.</b>

<p>Will the Gameboy Advance play multi-region games like the game boy or will it be restricted to NTSC and PAL?
 
<p>-Thanks, Laurence

<p><b>Pete: Game Boy Advance will be able to play games from all territories as far as I know. The GBA LCD does not comply to the NTSC or PAL standards.</b>
