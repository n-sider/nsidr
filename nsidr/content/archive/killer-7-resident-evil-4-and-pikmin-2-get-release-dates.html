<p>Also worth noting, IGNcube has learned that <i>Pikmin 2</i> is set to hit Japanese shelves on April 19, according to Nintendo of Japan. It's North American release is not yet known, but due to its absense in Nintendo of America's second quarter release schedule, many have speculated that the game may be pushed back to a third or fourth quarter release.
