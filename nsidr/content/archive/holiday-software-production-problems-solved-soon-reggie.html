Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime, speaking at a BMO Capital Markets conference, addressed recently-aired complaints by third parties that getting Wii software produced in time for the holidays is amounting to an uphill climb, with promises of impeding resolution.<br />

<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Reggie Fils-Aime, President, NOA</span>As every publisher talks about shifting over to Wii it's creating this crush of production right now at our factories for software.  What we've done is to ramp that capacity up and work with the publishers to ensure that their best titles get into the marketplace and [they] have a productive holiday. This is a very short-term situation that is effectively going to be resolved in a course of three week's time.</div></div><br />
Three weeks, unfortunately, leads these third parties into the beginning of December; in the U.S., the holiday shopping season unofficially starts on "Black Friday", the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday.<br />
