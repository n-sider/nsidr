<blockquote><font size="2">
Michel Ancel (Game Designer, Ubisoft)<br>
Creator of Rayman, BG&E and King Kong<br>
I feel just like a child with a new toy, opening millions of new doors of possibilities. More than an improvement, this way of playing is creating a new dimension. Its simple, when Nintendo unveils its hardware, every member of the team starts imagining crazy ideas. Its opening their minds. The fact of adding 3D gestures as the way of communicating with the game is just the perfect kind of innovation that can bring new games to new gamers. To me, it can bring the consoles what the mouse brought to the PC at it time. Its a 3D pointer with rotation information! Now, you're going to handle virtual objects, make recognition signs. Its closer to the way we act in real world, thats why its going to be mass market. Im sure that people will go crazy given the ability to interact so easily with virtual worlds. Im just mad about it!
