<p>Japan's Mainichi newspaper has the news that <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6147259.html">March saw Nintendo moving</a> over half a million Nintendo DS consoles &mdash; 180,000 of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">classic model</a> and 380,000 of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">lite</a> over in Japan.</p>

<p>The lite alone surpassed total sales for both Sony's PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable for that month. GameSpot, reporting on the story, speculates that the lite numbers may have even been higher, had Nintendo been able to keep up with demand.</p>

<p>In addition to the admirable hardware performance, Nintendo DS titles also took six of the top ten spots.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a>, introduced to that market last November, took second place and broke  the 2 million total sales mark.  Total software sales for all consoles were almost double the figure from March 2005.</p>
