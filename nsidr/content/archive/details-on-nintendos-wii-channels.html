<p>When a player turns on the Wii for the first time, a soft blue glow will light up the room and the <a href="http://wii.com/jp/movies/wiimenu/">WiiMenu</a> will appear on-screen.  You're probably familiar with the TV Guide Channel used when you want to see a list of what's currently on television.  It's the exact same idea.  Think of it as a homepage for what's available on Wii.  From this WiiMenu, you have access to a variety of Channels.  These include things from the mundane News Channel that gives you an interactive news experience to the necessary Disc Channel that allows you to play Wii games.  Below is a list and description of some of the planned Wii Channels.</p>

They also can change the "mood" of photos by brightening them, converting them to monochrome, inverting the color or changing them to stark black and white. Users can even add an MP3 tune to their slide shows. It provides a fun and easy outlet for people to edit their digital pictures. Users also can send their pictures to other Wii consoles by attaching a photo to the Wii Message Board.<br>

<p><font size="5"><b>Wii Shop Channel</b></font><br>

<b>Description:</b> This is where users go to buy Wii Points or redeem them to download classic video games to the Virtual Console. Nintendo said that over 30 Nintendo games and 30 PC TurboGrafx/Genesis games will be available before the end of the year. Ten new Virtual Console games will follow every month. Users also can use points to download the Opera browser used in the Internet Channel.</p>

<p><font size="5"><b>Internet Channel</b></font><br>
<b>Cost:</b> Initial one-time charge for Opera browser.<br>
<b>Description:</b> This channel dramatically changes the relationship between a user's home, the television and the Internet. Users download the Opera browser with Wii Points. Then they can surf the Internet right from the comfort of their couch. They can do quick research while watching a television program ("What was that actor's name again?"). Or book travel plans and shop during commercials. The service is compatible with Macromedia Flash.<br>

The service also allows for incoming messages targeted at software, such as a new map or weapon for a game. Games can constantly be updated, thereby extending their playability.<br>

<p><font size="5"><b>And Much More...</b></font><br>
IGN reports that a total of 48 channels can be stored on the Wii at one time.  Channels will also exist for games downloaded from the Virtual Console, though it's not yet clear how they will be setup.  Shortcuts can be made to certain games, and players will be able to organize items, for example, to view only Nintendo 64 games or Zelda games.  More details soon.</p>
