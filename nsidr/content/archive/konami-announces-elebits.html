<p>Weekly Famitsu has <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/703/703321p1.html">taken the wraps off</a> Konami's first announced Revolution game, titled <cite>Elebits</cite>.</p>

<p>Very little specifics about the gameplay were revealed, but the game appears to revolve around the hunting for tiny, cute creatures called (strangely enough) Elebits, which are responsible for making the game's world move.  The creatures need to be hunted for, and the game's world will evolve as Elebits are found.</p>

<p>Shingo Mukaitouge, the game's producer, said that the goal was to create a game that could not be played without the Revolution's controller &mdash; to give a feeling of touching the world behind the screen, moving things around and finding things.</p>

<p><cite>Elebits</cite> currently has no release date, but more is expected to be shown at the upcoming E3 show.</p>
