<p>Jeux-France has posted <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news14998_new-super-mario-bros-80-niveaux.html">several new scans</a> from upcoming DS Mario revival <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876"><i>New Super Mario Bros.</i></a>, some from the issue of Nintendo Power that has yet to find its way into my hands &mdash; and the big news is that the new game will feature 80 levels of Mario goodness.</p>

<p>Last we heard, the game's still headed for a release May 7 in the North America, just before E3 2006, and weeks before Japan gets to play it on May 25.</p>
