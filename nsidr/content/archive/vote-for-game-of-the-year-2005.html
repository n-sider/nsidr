<p>As he does every year, intrepid vote-collector <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=14">Mark Medina</a> is taking down your picks for <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=2953">Game of the Year 2005</a> over in our forums.</p>

<p>This year, we're allowing votes for any release in any territory (perfect for those of us who beefed up our DS libraries with never-to-leave-Japan imports in 2005), as well as taking your nominations for Worst Game and Worst Purchase.  If you do put your opinions down, be sure you take the time to explain your choices, lest your vote be disqualified; we want well-thought-out opinions here!</p>

<p>So, without further ado, get on over to the forums and vote!</p>
