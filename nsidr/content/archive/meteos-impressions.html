<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-06-13-meteos.jpg" border="0" align="right" style="margin-left: 5px">The premise of Meteos is pretty simple: blocks fall from the sky like meteors.  As they fall, you can control their speed and must use the touch screen to position them up or down.  Move and align three or more of the same types of blocks vertically or horizontally to launch those blocks and any that are atop of them into orbit.</p> 

<p>The more blocks you are trying to launch, the more you need to propel them, thus you must use combinations of launches to throw the big chucks of blocks into orbit. Theres a catch; you can only move blocks up and down, not left and right. Also, you can individually launch blocks into orbit and/or use them to try and nudge larger blocks youve already launched that final few steps into orbit. Thats the core gameplay of Meteos. Simple? Yes; but very fun and addicting. I found myself trying to find out what was the biggest chunk of blocks I could launch and successfully get into orbit. At first it might seem easy, but the further you progress, the faster the meteor blocks fall and subsequently, the faster they stack. Like Tetris, if they stack all the way to the top, you die.</p>

<p>Theres also different planets which act as different levels -- each one having its own gravitational field. So when it was an easy task to get, lets say, a four column, eight block-high stack into orbit before on one planet, its going to take you some extra combos to get it into orbit on another planet. The different combination of blocks, items you receive to help propel your meteor blocks, and the effort you exert to combo them into orbit all adds to the fun and challenge of this intense puzzle game. Im an old pro at Tetris, and I think Meteos is a more than worthy challenger to the puzzle game crown.</p>
