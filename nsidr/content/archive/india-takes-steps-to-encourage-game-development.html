According to a recent report by Business Today, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) is seeking out alliances with a few of the videogame industry's largest publishers. Indian game development and animation firms including Dhruva Interactive, Crest, and Jadoo have begun talks with Electronic Arts, Vivendi Universal, and Walt Disney. 

<p>For those unaware, similar announcements from countries like China, South Korea, and Singapore have been popping up over the past few months. It appears that everyone wants a piece of the videogame industry these days.
