<p>Electronic Gaming Monthly via 1Up.com has posted an interview with Nintendo of America's executive vice president of marketing, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>. Needless to say, it's another must read.  The small excerpt below isn't enough, so click <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3141656">here</a> to give it a look-see.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>EGM: Last year you told us that you wanted another Mario that's relevant to today's teens. Is that what you're talking about, basically?</b><br><br>
 
<b>Reggie:</b> Absolutely. That is the goal. Now, have I seen it yet? No. Do I know that they're working on it? Yes. But that has certainly been a key driver and a key messaging within NCL is: what is that next generation? And I think it's very important to note that what our game fans are also beginning to see is our next generation of great developers. I mean, Mr. Aonuma, having him come out on the stage, that was quite purposeful. With all of the great work he's done, he is now driving teams and creating this own vision for some of our franchises, and that's critical for our ongoing growth.
