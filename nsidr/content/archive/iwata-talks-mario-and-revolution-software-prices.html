Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> was interviewed by German website <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/technologie/0,1518,375121,00.html">Spiegel Online</a>.  Iwata spoke briefly on the Revolution software pricing structure and Nintendo's goal of having a Mario title available at launch.  You can read the translated excerpts below. 

<blockquote><font size="2">
Spiegel Online: Do you say to people also "Gaming can be cheaper [on Revolution] than it is on our competitors' consoles"? <br><br>

Iwata: I think, we should prepare a dynamic price margin, from which the consumers can select. Depending on the size and the volume of the project, we want perhaps different price structure. For masterpieces like The Legend of Zelda we will require perhaps as much as our competitors, but depending upon the software we will use different prices.<br><br>

Spiegel Online: Will you launch with a new Mario game?<br><br>

Iwata: I personally have asked Shigeru Miyamoto to arrange a new Mario game for launch but he did not answer yet. Perhaps he will give an answer to this question sometime in an interview with you. I find anyhow, as a gamer that we need a new Mario game at the start.</font></blockquote>
