<p>Nintendo trumpeted their latest round of LTD sales figures with the news that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> has sold more than 21 million units worldwide, and a bewildering comparison to Apple's iPod shipping just a million in that hardware's first 19 months.</p>

<p>The figures add up as follows.  U.S. numbers are sourced from The NPD Group, and worldwide numbers are counted by Nintendo themselves.</p>
