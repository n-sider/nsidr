<h3>[10.31] XXII - Vampire Killer</h3><P>Happy Halloween, N-Sider-ites!</P>
<P>Ah, Halloween.  It's the time of year when I like to dust off my scented candles, crack open a cold beverage of my choice, and play lots of Castlevania games repeatedly.  Did you all remember to set your clocks back an hour?  At least you United States-ians.  I think other parts of the world might do it too but I'm far too concerned on ethnocentrism to worry about everyone else on Earth.  But enough with pertinent things.</P>
<P>Did you miss me?  So many things have happened since the last column!  I've switched apartments as I'm sure many of you people have.  I went to Florida and came back, almost killed myself intentionally to avoid telemarketing, got a job at Target and then lost it, then started my senior year here at ISU.  I'm sure everyone else is having times chock-full of change and excitement too.</P>
<P>Last column I told you to write in about what sort of videogame movies you'd make if you could pick the actors and everything.  How exciting!</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Movie ideas, eh? All right, I think I can cook up something.</P>

<P>1) Streets of Star Fox. It's about Fox McCloud (Charlie Sheen), who in this situation is a gangster-turned-hero who fights crime in Corneria. He is joined by his buddies Peppy Hare (Kevin Costner), Slippy Toad (Jackie Chan), and Falco (Chris Rock). Of course, Andross, the biggest crime boss in the city, is played by none other than Michael Richards.</P>

<P>2) World of Warcraft: Battleground: The Movie. It's a pretty standard battle movie, featuring the epic clash of the Alliance and the Horde. Unfortunately, some viewers may have to wait 3-4 hours for the show to begin due to server crowding.</P>

<P>That's about it for now.</P>

Ok, I know its not exactly what you had in mind with this question,
but my idea is a film by Michael Moore about how bad video games are
for kids!!!
For one thing, Michael Moore is a huge douche, and since the idea of
video games actually making kids violent is a very douche-ish idea, it
seemed only fitting that he be the person to make a movie about it...
It would of course be about Michael Moore following around people that
know nothing about video games (like a teacher or a lawyer) and asking
their opinions on the matter. He would flaunt around stats and info
about kids murdering people and how they had played a violent game
once, therefor the game made them murderous.
Blah blah blah blah blah etc.
He would try to be clever, and fail. He would try to be funny, and
fail. He would try to make a good movie, and fail.
Just to make it clear I obviously dont think video games make children
violent...I just think it would be entertaining watching someone make
a movie trying to convince people that they do, and look like a total
dumbass in the process.
Sorry that I cant do any better...its like 2 in the morning and Im
just bored enough to write some random email about Michael Moore and
video game violence...:\</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>First, who the hell is that mr frost wannabe joker
dude?  Meh anyways its free stuff so once again I
shall do a crappy attempt at winning it.</P>

<P>Videogames into movies uh? I have some really good
ideas that would make some big blockbusters:</P>

<P>Kid Icarus</P>

<P>Pit : Robert de Niro<br>
Medusa: Mary Tyler Moore<br>
Eggplant Wizard: Jack Nicholson<br>
God: john Leguizamo</P>

<P>Kid Icarus Tells the story about a young Pit who is
sent by god to stop the evil ploys of medusa to take
over the angel realm.  Nop its not a kids movie, as
some parents would find the sight of Robert de niro in
short, white greek Clothes a bit disturbing.  This
movie features arrow-time slow motion SFX and the
death of legolas by the hands of Jack
Nicholson(Eggplant Wizard)</P>

<P>Duck Hunt:</P>

<P>Hunter: Keanu Reeves<br>

Dog: Robbin Williams<br>
Random Woman: Mary Tyler Moore</P>

<P>This is the story of hunter, a man who wants to be the
world's most famous duck hunter and goes on a trip
trhough the world's most famous swamps with his trusty
Dog and the lovely random woman.  It's a
heart-touching story about love, killing ducks, and
hope.</P>

<P>The Princess' Diary 4</P>

<P>Princess Peach: Natalie Portman<br>
Queen Toadstool: Mary Tyler Moore<br>
Mario Mario: John Goodman<br>

Luigi Mario: Dan Aykroyd<br>
Toad: Woody Allen<br>
King Bowser: Bruce Willis<br>
Prince: Leonardo Di Caprio</P>

<P>We follow the princess peach's story as she gets
divorced from the actual Prince to live a life of
danger, procrastination and orgies with the Mario and
Luigi Brothers.  This leads into a tale of crimes and
the murder of king Bowser by the hands of the dreadful
trio.  This movie is not suited for the small children
as it contains scenes of sex, rape, homosexuality(Toad
and the prince) and violence.</P>

<P>Metal Gear Solid</P>

<P>Staff: I have no Idea.</P>

<P>This is the only serious movie I would like to see. 
Something based on the actual game, not something else
using the game's name, like every vg movie.  sure the
story is a bit long but it could be shortened without
losing too many details.  And they would have a hard
time finding good actors to fill the roles of these
highly interesting characters.  But whoever they
chose, Mary Tyler Moore should be there.  Oh and Hideo
should direct it.</P>

If you insult my cat I will do the above.
ANYWAY, they should make Pac-man into a movie. Imagine a yellow blob eating things and the law sending out ghosts to stop it. But when Pac-man eats too much he explodes and dies, killing everything. 
I'm not sure how to end this letter so how about I just threaten to rip your balls off and feed it to my cat!</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>I've always wondered when we were going to see Pong: The Movie.</P>

<P>It's about a spunky kid living happily in a non-violent-gang-infested,
hooker-infested, drug-infested, but otherwise strangely hygienic
neighborhood.  Then, suddenly, one day, his happy life is shattered by a
tragic accident in which a gigantic square white cube flattens his
single mother while she is innocently walking the red light district.
At the same time, an evil politician wants to demolish his lovely
neighborhood and turn it into a toxic radioactive waste dump.</P>

<P>Said spunky kid has no choice but to throw himself into a garbage
compactor, which miraculously turns him into a long white line.  And so
he saves the universe from more gigantic square white cubes, and also
gets the evil politician voted out and all the non-violent gang members
and hookers and drugs dance in the streets in a stirring musical
closing.</P>

<P>Also SSB 3 should have biger stages. and i dont want a prze... that snow man creeps me out. </P>    </TD>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Okay, I'm not sure if this qualifies as an "existing" game that should
be made into a movie, but I think I'd pay to see a Mario Paint movie.</P>

<P>It would star Danny Devito as Mario, the tortured artist, and Sharon
Stone as Peach, the washed up actress that sticks around because she
apparently has nothing better to do. Jeff Goldblum would play Luigi,
the gangly brother with good intentions who gets pushed away time and
again by Mario.</P>

<P>Mario's overnight fame is too much to deal with and he turns to drugs
to ease the pain. His drug-induced hallucinations inspire ever greater
works of art, mainly dealing with princesses, animated stick figures,
and the looming specter of infinite flies to be swatted. Eventually,
Mario is enrolled in the Plumbing Art Therapy School, with the burnt
out teacher being played by Nick Nolte.</P>

<P>Directed by Roman Polanski, this is a searing tale of one man's
meteoric rise to fame, descent into madness, and eventual redemption.</P>

<P>For next week, please write in and talk to me about pornography and alcohol!  Or you know, all the new games coming out.
