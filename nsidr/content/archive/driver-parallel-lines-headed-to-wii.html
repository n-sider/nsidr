Atari has dropped <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news18991_driver-se-devoile-sur-wii.html">a handful of screens</a> confirming the existence of a port of <i>Driver: Parallel Lines</i> for Wii.  Unfortunately, according to the report from Jeux-France, the company is apparently not currently saying how the title will actually play on Wii.<br />
<br />
The Wii port of Driver: Parallel Lines looks to be hitting European shelves in March.
