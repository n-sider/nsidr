Nintendo of America's website is asking "My Nintendo" members to participate in a Internet connection survey and test.  Nintendo says the test will help provide a better user experience for you when you play Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection games on your Nintendo DS later this year. Nintendo has asked select users to download and install software that runs tests on their home network and internet connection and then reports those results to Nintendo's servers.  Once the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/user_survey/wifi.jsp">survey and test</a> has completed, the program becomes an Animal Crossing-themed desktop clock.
