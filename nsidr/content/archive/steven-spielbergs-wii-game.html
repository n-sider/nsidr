In collaboration with Steven Spielberg, EA is currently working on three brand new intellectual properties. Two of those three were revealed in a press release today.<br />
<br />
One of those two games is an action-adventure title with an emphasis on emotional interaction for the 360, PS3, and PC. The other is a puzzle game for all ages inspired by Jenga.<br />
<br />
The Jenga-inspired game features a physics engine that allegedly brings Wii remote interactivity to a new level. Move the remote as you would a block to perform that motion on screen. There are single-player, co-op, and versus gameplay modes, and players can even use the Wii remote to build their own games and structures, or bring out the inner King Kong and tear them down.<br />
<br />
No release date was given for either game. It is possible the games may be shown at E3 in some form, but there is no confirmation one way or the other.
