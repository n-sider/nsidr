<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3234-1.jpg" width="200" height="112" class="image_styled" /></div>Square-Enix has publicly unveiled a trailer for upcoming Wii title <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers</i>, which you can <a href="http://www.ffccnews.jp/2007/05/85.html">view over at the ffccnews.jp site</a>.<br />
<br />
The trailer, originally shown on May 12 and 13 at the Square Enix Party 2007 event, is a hodgepodge of short clips showing various aspects of the game and story.  The design of the game shows some Kingdom Hearts influence and marks a clear departure from the style used in the GameCube's <i>Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</i> as well as the nearly-released <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</i> for Nintendo DS.
