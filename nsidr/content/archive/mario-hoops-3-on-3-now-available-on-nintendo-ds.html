"Overall, I think this is a great game, even if you don't like basketball. But like any other DS game, I'd recommend playing it in short bursts; otherwise you'd end up doing the same thing over and over again - not that it's not fun, it can just be a little tiresome. But that aside, the graphics can't be faulted, and the control system is new and unique."

"With hours and hours of gameplay in the tournament mode alone this is worth a purchase. Then you add on tons of unlockables including Final Fantasy characters and different basketballs and you've got a instant purchase. Oh yeah then you add on the extra mini-games, the WiFi Basketball, and the WiFi Mario Kart-esque game and you've got a no-brainer must have game of the summer. Get this game."

"3-on-3 is an initially decent game of basketball, as long as you're not looking for a sim -- and really, there's little else on the system worth considering for hoops. But the grand experiment of translating stylus swipes into intuitive no-look passes and alley-oops fails more often than it works, and that's the big "if" upon which the whole thing hangs. If you know of at least three other players who plan to dive into what's offered here, then it's worth a try. For anyone looking for real longevity past the initial trial cups and training games, you're better off biding your time until something less frustrating comes along."
