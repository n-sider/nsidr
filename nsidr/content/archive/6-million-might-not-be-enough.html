A story at Virgin.net quotes Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=399">Yoshihiro Mori</a> suggesting the 6 million Wii consoles Nintendo is expected to manufacture between launch and the end of their fiscal year on March 31st <a href="http://gamesnews.virgin.net/Virgin/Lifestyle/Games/virginGamesNewsDetail/0,13470,1636567_playbetandwin,00.html">may not be enough</a> to meet demand.<br />
<br />
Nintendo execs have previously said they <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2453">expect to have a million units</a> available for the console's launch in North America on November 19&mdash;potentially making the notion of preorders for launch day obsolete.  The console will sell for MSRPs of around $250 in the United States and $280 in Canada.
