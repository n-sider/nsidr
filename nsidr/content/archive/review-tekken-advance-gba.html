<b>Tekken Advance</b><br>

<font size="1"> 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2001, 2002 Namco</font>



<P>The Playstation generation signalled the beginning of the end for 2D fighters such as <i>Mortal Kombat, King of Fighters</i>, and of course the legendary, and still arguably superior fighting game, <I>Street Fighter II.</I>



<P>Ever since <I>Virtua Fighter</i> burst onto the scene with its fluid life-like animations and then-gorgeous 3D graphics, game players suddenly swarmed to the genre.  Segas <I>Virtua Fighter 2</I> arrived with much fanfare, and it was around then that Namco unleashed <I>Tekken</I> onto the masses, with its System 11-powered hardware, it was a major success.



<P>Perhaps luckily for the GBA, these traditional 3D fighters were essentially 2D fighters on a 3D plane.  <I>Virtua Fighter, Tekken, Dead or Alive,</i> and <I>Soul Calibur</i> can all claim to be 3D but in purity terms, theyre 2D.  This one fact now brings us to this review; <i>Tekken Advance</i> has arrived on Nintendos predominantly 2D portable platform, the Gameboy Advance.



<p><b>Features</b>

<ul>

<li> Eleven fighters (Ten standard, one hidden)

<li> Arcade, Vs. and Team Battle modes

<li> Two player fisticuffs via Link Cable

<li> Battery backup save

<li> <B>Only for</b> Game Boy Advance

  </ul>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/6stars.jpg" align="left"><A HREF="Mailto:mark@n-sider.com"><B>Mark Medina:</b></a>Players accustomed to the joys of <I>Tekken</i> on the Playstation and arcade systems must be balking at the now-portable form that the game has taken.  Its no wonder that the GBA version cant graphically compete with its illustrious forebears, but it doesnt need to, and it would never be able to, given the hardware limitations.



<P>Speaking of limitations, Namco have done an absolutely incredible job bringing <I>Tekken</i> to life on Nintendos humble handheld.  Graphically, while obviously no PSX beater, it certainly looks absolutely amazing on GBA.  Backgrounds have fine detail, the fighters have excellent animation, and the 3D effect, mode-7 style, does wonders to convince sceptical gamers of its graphical prowess.  Namco should be commended with the graphical quality of the game.



<P>Sound effects are suitably beefy, bone crunching noises and background music adds to the atmosphere, and its very satisfying when a particularly meaty punch is complemented by an excellent sound effect with requisite oomph.



<P>Gameplay-wise, its the same silky one-on-one fighter, with most of the incredible combos included and most of your favourite fighters to play as, competitive fighting via linkup, and some interesting features and play modes.



<P>Yet it all feels so dumbed down, like something is missing, as though its not really <i>Tekken.  Tekken</I> was all about strategically placing the four buttons to each left and right hand and foot, something the GBA could also do with its four main buttons.  These four buttons provided scope for some cool combinations, excellent strategies, various grabs and throws, and defensive moves to boot.  Why Namco decided to use one button for punch, one for kick, one for grab, and one for tag for this GBA version is beyond me, when all those features were perfectly feasible on other platforms with the one button for each limb and all it entails included.  Make no mistake, most of your favourite combos still work, with a little imagination, and some guesswork.  It just doesnt feel right.  It feels too easy to throw an opponent, or just button bash your way through the main game.



<P>Two-player mode, as usual, provides much respite.  But it can also sometimes just boil down to whoever hits the buttons and the d-pad faster.  Granted, two experts will still be able to have fluid, smooth, and strategic bouts, but the novice has a much higher chance of winning in this version of <I>Tekken.</I>  And that, to me, is a bad thing.  The gap between hardly any practice and expert is too small.  The challenge becomes smaller, and hence the enjoyment level is much less.  And thats not good for games.



<P>Unfortunately it gets boring pretty quickly, chiefly due to the dumbed down control scheme, the relative lack of difficulty, and the absence of extra play modes and such.  Theres only so far a Time Attack mode can take you with a fighting game, and its not often youll get to play competitively with another equally skilled player.



<P>Overall, its still a good game, worthy of a play, and especially so if you can always find some good competition.  Its a little disappointing in some areas, but quite amazing in others.  If possible, go out and try <I>Tekken Advance</i> before you buy, otherwise you may find youself disappointed, as I was.
