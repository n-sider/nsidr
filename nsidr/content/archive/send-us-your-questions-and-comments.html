<p>Oh really?</p>

<p>"I will be laughing at you all [N-Sider staff] when Travis and I own the world with Q&A Resurrection," said resident broken-promiser Jeff Van Camp.  "It will be epic. Travis, tell them. Someone put up a news story requesting the best in questions, comments, and whatnot from readers. Q&A is returning, and this time it's personal."

<p>Let Jeff prove us right by writing him and Travis an overwhelming amount of questions and comments and sending them to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>.</p>
