Portuguese magazine Maxi Consolas has revealed, via an interview with director Takashi Iizuka, that the long-rumored entry in the NiGHTS franchise for Wii is a reality.<br />
<br />
The game, teased in a recent Official Nintendo Magazine as well as shown then hastily redacted in an online shot of a Game Reactor cover, will be exclusive to Wii.  Multiplayer modes are in the works, as well as some form of online component.  Iizuka says making the sequel has long been an interest of his, and now, with Wii, seemed a perfect time to begin work on it.<br />
<br />
Not many details are available, but the confirmation (and some game images) have been <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news19769_nights-wii-premieres-images.html">scanned by Jeux-France</a>, and a translation of <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=5952947&postcount=80">the interview</a> is available at NeoGAF.
