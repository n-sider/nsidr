<p>Nintendo will allocate 39 percent more funds to its research and development and advertising divisions, increasing spending to a total of 22 billion yen, according to IGN and Japan's Nikkei Financial Daily.  Nintendo hopes the increase in R&D spending will result in the production of new software to take advantage of its Nintendo DS hardware.  It's also likely Nintendo is preparing for its next-generation home console codenamed 'Revolution'.</p>
