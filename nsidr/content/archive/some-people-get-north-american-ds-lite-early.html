<P>Just about every site on the cyberweb is reporting that one enterprising lad over at the Cheap Ass Gamer <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/archives/cags-score-ds-lites-from-target-walmart.php">forums</a> got his hands on a sweet, sweet Lite because some Target had a display case full of them and he just walked up and asked if he could buy one and they sold it to him.</P>

<P>The odds are good that you are impatient, and you have already left to check out other Target and Wal-Mart stores (which other forum-goers have reported sometimes being successful with), so really there's no logical reason why you even need to read the thread.  As is usually the case with these mad hot street-date breaking summers, your mileage, as they say in "the biz," may vary.</P>

<P>This writer's mileage is firmly lodged in his twenty-five dollar preorder and delicious <i>patience</i>, you monkey fools!</P>
