<p>According to GameCube Europe, a few hours ago <a href="
https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</a> held a press conference to discuss the current situation regarding the Revolution. As well as wanting the person[s] behind the <i>fan-video</i> to contact Nintendo's PR department.</p>

<p>Most of the highlights were already known. But non-the-less, there is still a few interesting tidbits of information.</p>

<ul><li>When asked after the interview why no Mario 128 was shown at the conference as promised, he apologized saying he could only show what Miyamoto would let him show...</li>
<li>He has confirmed Revolution versions of Mario, Metroid and Zelda are all in development.</li>
<li>Questioned about the Nintendo fan-video, he confirmed it was a fake, but would like the fan to give Nintendo's PR department a call!</li>
<li>Reggie says Nintendo will show the Revolution's controller when Sony and Microsoft have their specs locked down so they cannot steal the idea!</li>
<li>The next Revolution announcement "has its timetable", and at the right time, Nintendo will get the word out. "Keep hanging with us," says Reggie.</li>
<li>The Revolution will apparently bring "new genres", and new mixes of genres.</li>
<li>Reggie says there is a need for the Revolution "to combine the original NES, SNES, N64, and Gamecube controllers into one interface".</li>
<li>Additionally, Reggie has said Nintendo want to get more small developers on board for the Revolution.</li></ul>
