Even though we've spotlighted a fair number of games in this year's guide, it feels like we haven't even scratched the surface&#8212;there is simply an absolutely <i>huge</i> crop of titles out there today.  Regardless, we hope that we've inspired you in your game-shopping endeavors; there's a lot of gaming goodness out there, and it'd be a shame if it went unnoticed.<br />
<br />
Of course, though we can advise, we can't predict with absolute certainty what your friends and relatives are going to like: tastes vary.  If you're not absolutely sure you've got a winner, a gift card is a great alternative that will give the gamer on your shopping list the opportunity to make their own selections&#8212;and frees you from having to get involved in returns or receipts.<br />
<br />
Everyone here at N-Sider wishes all our readers a happy and safe holiday season&#8212;and enjoy your holiday haul of gaming bliss!
