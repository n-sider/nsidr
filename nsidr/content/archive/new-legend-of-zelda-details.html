<p>IGNCube has learned several new details about <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> for GameCube.

<p><ul>

<li>The title will run on a modified version of the Wind Waker engine.

<li>It's not a remake, but rather an original story and game.

<li>Link will feature the same eye-tracking system used in Wind Waker.

<li>A new dynamic camera system - when Link explores dungeons the camera will pan back and shoot the action from a top-down angle but when the character encounters an enemy the camera will change to the normal behind-the-back perspective.

<li>Neither Shigeru Miyamoto nor Eiji Aonuma will be directing the Legend of Zelda title. Both serve as producers. The new director is not known.

  </ul></p>
