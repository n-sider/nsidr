<p>According to <a href="http://www.nintendojo.com/infocus/view_item.php?1147105141">Nintendojo</a>, the word "Wii" was the fourth fastest rising search word on Google.com for the week ending May 1.  The NFL Draft placed at number one, followed by Cindy Margolis and United 93. In fifth was Cinco de Mayo.  Recall that Nintendo announced the codename of Revolution would be <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/">renamed to Wii</a> on April 27.  This likely incited curiosity in a word that previously had no meaning attached to it.</p>
