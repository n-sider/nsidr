<p>Video game exporter Lik-Sang recently received one of the first DS Lite units, and true to form, took <a href="http://www.lik-sang.com/news.php?artc=3808">lots of pictures</a> and answered practically every question anyone would ever think of asking.</p>

<p>Some of the more commonly asked questions are answered:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>The charger is <em>not</em> the same as the Game Boy micro's, which was speculated based on the FCC application.</li>
<li>The battery is entirely new and rated at 1000 mAh instead of the old 850 mAh.</li>
<li>Currently marketed DS screen protectors will fit, though the top screen protector is a little larger than the actual screen area.</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>The DS Lite hits Japan in a matter of days, and colors other than white will follow just over a week later.</p>
