Not long ago, Mercury Games <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=day&date=2007-06-23">announced</a> that it would be bringing Ertain's Zen series of DS games to Europe and America. The first to be localized will be <i>Paint by DS</i>, originally called <i>PaintPleasure</i>.<br />
<br />
As seen in the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=5428&view=media">screenshots</a>, players can use the DS' stylus and touch screen to mix water and oil-based paint colors and then recreate classic artistic masterpieces in their own unique style. The game comes with fifteen different paintings, including works by Hokusai, Cezanne and Van Gogh. Aside from the paintings, there are also several minigames included, such as puzzles based on the famous artwork.<br />
<br />
There will be two different limited editions of Paint by DS; one will come with a paint set and the other with a paint book. The game is currently set for a European release on August 24. An American release will follow sometime in late 2007.
