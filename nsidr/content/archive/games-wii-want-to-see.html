<p>Games. We want them. We want to see them. We want to play them. Some of us even want to hug them. Yet there are a number of games we've been wanting for years that, for one reason or another, just haven't materialized. The following is a list of some games and franchises we'd like on store shelves. The list mingles rich speculation with key facts to highlight games we may or may never see. On Wii.</p>

<h2>Racing with Speed</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-29-cardemogamecube.jpg" border="1" alt="Nintendo Car Demo GameCube"></p>

<p>Some may recall at the 2000 Space World in Tokyo, Japan, Nintendo showcased a short video demonstration of a racing game for its then newly-unveiled GameCube console.  The demo opened with a high-polygon Dodge Viper racing along at 60 frames per second. The screen began to fill with one car after another, eventually reaching a total of 12 appearing on-screen at once. It was rumored then that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=942">Martin Hollis</a> and Nintendo Technology Development, a hardware division in Nintendo's Redmond, WA, headquarters, were responsible for the technical demonstration.  When Hollis left to form his own studio Zoonami six months later, the rumor of the game followed him.  Zoonami <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/columnview.php?columnid=76#revlimit">responded</a> to these murmurings saying, "We've also seen claims that we're making a Gran Turismo clone, and that the car demo shown at Space World for the GameCube launch was done by us. False, all of them."</p>

<p>Now, just last week, we had <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>, Nintendo of America VP of Sales and Marketing, reveal during a marketing campaign at the Nintendo World Store that the Wii console would see an exciting racing game.  He said, "We're going to show a racing game at E3 where you use the core controller in a very different way."  Could this be the same game?</p>


<h2>Icarus and The Wings of Time</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-29-kidicarus.jpg" border="1" alt="Kid Icarus Retro Studios"></p>

<p>A nod to <a href="http://www.lifemetercomics.com/art/kidicarus_zack.html">LifeMeter</a> for the artwork.  Released in 1987, Kid Icarus weaved a modern mythos based loosely on ancient Greek Mythology. Medusa the Goddess of Darkness had overthrown Angel Land's peaceful ruler Parthena, the Goddess of Light, and imprisoned her. Parthena's only hope lie in the young angel Pit who was trapped in the underworld when Medusa's armies attacked. Armed with the magical bow Parthena sent him with the last of her power, Pit was faced with the daunting challenge of escaping the underworld and rescuing her from Medusa's clutches and restoring peace to Angel Land.</p>

<p>Using the original Metroid's game engine, Kid Icarus featured similar game play elements that ranged from shooting enemies to collecting the many items he would eventually need to defeat Medusa. With its solid game play it is now considered a classic by many, however it wasn't always held in such high esteem. Instead, it was initially over-shadowed by many of Nintendo's other now famous franchises, including its game engine's benefactor, Metroid. And aside from a few hardcore fans, Icarus has been long forgotten by Nintendo and gamers alike.</p>

<p>Although Pit has had many cameo appearances in games that range from Tetris to Super Smash Bros. Melee, there was only one sequel; the rare Kid Icarus: Myths and Monsters for the Game Boy. Without an appearance in almost 20 years, the sole reason for wanting a sequel to this long forgotten title is nostalgia: pure and simple nostalgia.  Nevertheless, would it not be coming "full circle" if Nintendo used the Metroid Prime engine to deliver us a new Icarus?</p>


<h2>Gardening with Pikmin</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-29-pikmin.jpg" border="1" alt="Pikmin for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>The Pikmin series got its start on the Nintendo 64.  Several experiments and unrealized game concepts formed the structure of this quirky game. These include <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=958">Cabbage</a>, an unreleased title for the Nintendo 64DD and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=547">100 Marios</a>, a GameCube demonstration at the 2000 Space World show.  The groundwork for Pikmin began in early 2000 by staggered members of the 1080 Snowboarding team who had just aborted the N64 sequel.  Programmer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=259">Colin Reed</a> came up with the AI system after various experiments. Yoshi creator <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=44">Shigefumi Hino</a> invented the  character designs while <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> came up with the idea of a garden setting, inspired by his then new-found hobby.</p>

<p>The armies of Pikmin have grown and so too have its fans.  This fact only heightens the reason why an online component would fit the series.  Although sales of Pikmin 2 weren't something to write home about, it's well-known that members of Nintendo have an affinity for the series.</p>


<h2>Pennant Chasing Baseball and Fishing</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-29-nintendopennantchase.jpg" border="1" alt="Nintendo Pennant Chase Baseball from Exile Interactive"></p>

<p>Like the sport it tries to simulate, Pennant Chase Baseball has experienced some curve balls over the past several years.  When Take Two made a deal with the Major League Baseball Players Association in 2005, it meant that it could use the property exclusively to release games.  Other third-party developers were forced to cancel their baseball projects, use generic baseball references or partner with one of the three console manufacturers.  Known for its World Series Baseball series, developer Exile Interactive had no choice but to turn to Nintendo to publish its baseball game.  Unfortunately, things didn't go as smoothly as planned.  The game missed its intended release date and with dwindling Gamecube sales, the title was put on indefinite hold.  We've heard word that Exile Interactive closed its doors after this.  Calls to its office in fact reveal the phone number is no longer in service.</p>

<p>Still, just two days ago, Exile Interactive updated its <a href="http://www.exileinteractive.com/">website</a> with a small line of text that reads, "Gone fishing."  Does this mean the company is fishing for jobs or developing a fishing title?  I suppose we'll soon find out.</p>


<h2>Funkydilla on the Dance Floor</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-29-funkydilla.jpg" border="1" alt="Funkydilla for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>If you remember back in April 2004, EDGE UK magazine featured a news story about an upcoming game that would supposedly use only one button. That game was Funkydilla, and the developers were Zoonami, headed by Martin Hollis, the man who had played a major hand in developing the Nintendo 64-classic Goldeneye 007. People were excited over this game. After all, not only was Hollis at the helm, but there was the curiosity factor over a game designed to use only one button.</p>

<p>Since that lone announcement in 2004, nothing has been said on the game or even the developer, who has also done nothing else since. Perhaps they have just had really bad luck developing the game. Perhaps they can't make the game with the limitation of a single button. If it's the latter, the Wii is the cure. By allowing hand gestures, Zoonami will be able to save face. "Notice how we said button? You guys should've paid more attention."</p>


<h2>Nintendo Talent Studio</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-05-01-marioartist.jpg" border="1" alt="Mario Paint Talent Studio for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>Nintendo announced Stage Debut for GameCube during the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The game evolved from a group of former Nintendo 64DD titles released under the Mario Artist series. Talent Maker, Polygon Maker, and Paint Studio combined to form the GameCube version of Stage Debut. Director <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=370">Yoichi Yamada</a> had hoped to introduce the game using several peripherals including the e-Reader and Game Boy Advance link cable. However, as the story has been told many times, there were far too many barriers preventing its release.</p>

<p>Until now.  Nintendo is known for its creativity.  Naturally, its fans share that quality.  Give us the tools Nintendo, and we'll make you proud.  Just don't forget the mini-games.  Many of us fondly remember the fly-swatting game that was part of the Mario Paint experience. After drawing and composing got a little shallow there was nothing like mousing over to the little coffee-cup for some bug smashing action. With the SNES mouse we were offered a new way to do something that wouldn't have been as fun with a regular controller. The Wiimote practically screams flyswatter. (If you remember, there was even a short clip of this possibility in the first teaser video revealing the control.)</p>


<h2>Wii Gotta Catch 'Em All</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-29-nintendopokemon.jpg" border="1" alt="Pokemon for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=771">Satoshi Tajiri</a> is credited for creating the Pokemon series.  In the late 90s it was dubbed a fad.  Today we look back and call it a phenomenon.  There had been nothing like it in the video game industry and there has been nothing like it since.  Pokemon practically kidnapped the children of the world with its cute characters and addicting collectables.  "Gotta' catch 'em all," they said.  Although the phenomenon has since calmed, the Pokemon games remain some of the best-selling software on the market.</p>

<p>We can't think of any series more up to task for Wii than Pokemon.  The console editions of the game are dubbed Pokemon Stadium and have achieved moderate success, due in part to the finesse of developer Genius Sonority.  With the popularity of Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service, one can only expect the game's next outing to feature the same addictive gameplay, only now shared with players from around the world.</p>


<h2>One Controller, One Wheel, One Race</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-30-uniracers.jpg" border="1" alt="Uniracers for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>Here's a nostalgia trip. Uniracers, or Unirally as it was known in PAL territories, released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo. It was a 2D game that involved racing driverless unicycles around multi-coloured racing tracks. The key to winning was to perform stunts as you drove along, as these increased your speed. In a nutshell, the game was insane. But it was also a hell of a lot of fun.  the game was absolutely brilliant -- from the over-the-top background music to the way your Unicycle would turn around if another one got close to it.</p>

<p>But that was 12 years ago. What's been seen of Uniracers since then? Anything? No? Well, that's a problem! But with the Wii, we have a controller that moves on three axes. And the Unicycles also moved on three axes. Three and three makes six. Come on Rockstar, ditch GTA for a bit and come back to what got you guys started.</p>


<h2>Blasted Corpses</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-05-01-blastcorps.jpg" border="1" alt="Blast Corps for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>Back in 1997, Blast Corps was released on the Nintendo 64 and was probably one of the most unique games ever to grace the console. Blast Corps featured a runaway nuclear missile carrier on a collision course of epic proportions. The main focus of the game was for the player to clear a path for the carrier on each level in the world map. There were many side-tasks to complete, but during the first run through, a clear path for the carrier took precedence.</p>

<p>Despite some minor flaws, the game was a relative success, and with some tweaking of a few gameplay elements (most notably the inability to replay a path mission) Blast Corps has the potential to be a huge hit on Wii. With the motion sensor remote, the game would be a blast (pun intended) to control.  Unfortunately, with Microsoft's purchase of developer Rare, this dream remains just that.</p>


<h2>Chibi-Robo! Love</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-05-01-chibirobo.jpg" border="1" alt="Chibi-Robo! for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>Nobody likes to do chores. So why a game featuring a domestic robot doesn't feel like a chore is entirely beyond me... Because the fact of the matter is, Chibi Robo! is a great game to play, presenting an interesting take on a genre and having one of the cutest damn characters ever.</p>

<p>How can you say no to a face like that... The game is charming from head to toe. In what other game can you dress up a robot in a frog suit, nay, have to dress up a robot in a frog suit? Very few. In fact, I would say none. Except Chibi Robo. Sweet. It's also a game that could use the Wii controller really creatively. For example, vacuming. Just thinking about it is awesome. I mean, you won't ever catch me vacuuming a house, but virtual vacuuming? That's possibly the coolest thing ever.</p>


<h2>Bound to Earth</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-05-01-earthbound.jpg" border="1" alt="Earthbound for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>Earthbound. The name says it all. Here in the states, we've only received one helping of this franchise (although Mother 3 may make its way here) and frankly, that isn't enough. The Earthbound franchise also has the distinction of being one of Nintendo's wacky RPG's. Why is that significant? Because it would allow Nintendo the freedom to make a not-so-traditional RPG using the innovative Wii controller functions during gameplay. And not necessarily all of the innovation could derive from any combat sequences. Nintendo could make you spin/crank the controller (like your feet do) while you ride the bicycle. Or have you swing your weapon at an approaching enemy before entering combat (to decide whether you get a pre-emptive strike). Or even have you hold the controller to your ear while using the telephone. The possibilities are endless, and I hope that Nintendo heeds our call.</p>


<h2>Pilotwings: Resurrection</h2>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-05-05-pilotwings.jpg" border="1" alt="Pilotwings for Nintendo Wii"></p>

<p>Pilotwings celebrates its 15th anniversary this year. In a decade and a half there have only been two iterations of the franchise. Both of them sold very well, but there's never a push for a sequel. However, when you think about it, this makes perfect sense. The original Pilotwings was a demonstration of the power of the SNES to produce a flight simulator and games of a slightly 3D nature. Pilotwings 64 was one of the first games to demonstrate the power of the Nintendo 64 to offer completely new 3D gameplay and made use of the consoles innovative control stick. There were always rumors of a GameCube edition, but it never materialized. This is likely because it would have been eerily similar to Pilotwings 64. The Nintendo Wii gives the franchise a reason to end its 10 year dormancy. The freestyle controller offers a path to completely reinventing the game. Pilotwings wiill return.</p>
