Electronic Arts has announced that it will be bringing <i>Boogie</i>, an original music title built specifically for Wii, to the console this year.<br />
<br />
Not much is currently known about how exactly the title will play, but EA is saying it will take advantage of "innovative Wii controls to get gamers off their couch".  Boogie will let players dance, sing, and create music videos, customizing game characters to show off dancing style and karaoke skills.  The mention of "singing" and "karaoke" has ignited as-of-yet unsubstantiated rumors of a Wii microphone peripheral.<br />
<br />
"We're creating something new and different for gamers of all ages to enjoy; the complete party package where gamers can dance as well as sing," said Alain Tascan, Vice President and General Manager of EA Montreal, where recent EA Wii exclusive <i>SSX Blur</i>  was created.
