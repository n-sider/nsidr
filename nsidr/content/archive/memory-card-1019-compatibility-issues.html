<p>Nintendo of America would like to inform consumers of some issues that may be encountered when using the recently released Memory Card 1019 with select games.  According to CV&G, these games include:</p>


<font size=1">
<p>Backyard Football:<br>
When using an unformatted Memory Card 1019, the game will ask if you would like to format the Memory Card. Selecting "Yes" will cause the game to freeze. If you have an unformatted Memory Card 1019, and wish to save Backyard Football game data, you must first save game data from another game not listed as incompatible on this page. Doing so will automatically format the Memory Card.</p>

<p>Sonic Adventure 2 Battle:<br>
If there are more than 999 free blocks on the Memory Card 1019, the game cannot display the amount of free blocks. With less than 999 free blocks, the amount of free blocks will display properly.  While mathematically the Memory Card 1019 should be able to hold hundreds of Sonic Adventure 2 Battle game files, the maximum it can hold is 99.</p> 

<p>Darkened Skye:<br>
If multiple save files are created, the game occasionally will not allow any new files to be created, even though there are enough free blocks on the Memory Card 1019. Removing and reinserting the Memory Card 1019 when this happens should solve the problem.</p> 

<p>WTA Tour Tennis:<br>
The game does not recognize the Memory Card 1019 properly, and should not be used. We suggest using a Memory Card 59 or 251 with this game.</p> 

<p>Disney Sports: Skate Boarding:<br>
The game does not recognize the Memory Card 1019 properly, and should not be used. We suggest using a Memory Card 59 or 251 with this game.</p> 

<p>Disney Sports: Soccer:<br>
The game does not recognize the Memory Card 1019 properly, and should not be used. We suggest using a Memory Card 59 or 251 with this game.</p>

<p>Games with known issues when used with a Memory Card 1019, 251, or 59:</p>

<p>NHL Hitz 20-03:<br>
When using an unformatted Memory Card, the game will ask if you would like to format the Memory Card. Selecting "Yes" will cause the game to freeze. If you have an unformatted Memory Card, and wish to save NHL Hitz 20-03 game data, you must first save game data from another game not listed as incompatible on this page. Doing so will automatically format the Memory Card.</p>

<p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Sweet 16:<br>
Graphics sometimes will not display properly if a file is loaded and restarted after quitting the game. It is recommended that the system be powered off and powered back on before loading the file to play again.</p>
