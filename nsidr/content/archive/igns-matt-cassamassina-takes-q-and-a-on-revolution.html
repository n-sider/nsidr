<p>If you drop by the IGN forums on a regular basis, you may have stumbled across <a href="http://revoeyes.blogspot.com/2006/02/matt-reveals-more-about-revolution-in.html">a Q&A session</a> going on between Revolution channel editor Matt Cassamassina and forum members.  Cassamassina apparently has a lot of sources working on Revolution titles, and this especially frank Q&A has some interesting tidbits of information and opinion that speaks well of the Revolution's future.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Regarding devs getting into the freestyle controller: "I think there is a bit of a process, based on what devs tell me. You don't just dive in and it works. There's a ton of tweaking involved. I heard Retro struggled to get Prime working with it, but that once it finally did, it was easier to go on. Clearly some of the results speak for themselves. Every dev who has a kit and a controller seems very excited about the possibilities."</p></li>

<li><p>On expanding the gaming market: "Nintendo can market this machine to anybody and if it succeeds in that regard, it will take off. Targeting the Oprah audience with DS is just the start. The Big N is going after the real mainstream -- not some term we use whenever the new Halo or GTA sell three million copies."</p></li>

<li><p>On what the freestyle controller will give the most benefit to: "FPSs. God games. Games with swords. These are the most obvious, but even so, I can't wait to play games of this type on Revolution. Meanwhile, Wario Ware-style software will also rock. I'm probably most excited about the new genres -- the software we can't predict; the stuff that surprises us and innovates."</p></li>

<li><p>On his personal opinion on Revolution, Xbox 360, and PS3: "I really like my 360. I think Live is an amazing service. I picked up Fight Night Round 3 today and going to play Peer in a few online matches shortly. I've been fairly impressed with the presentation of some 360 games and disappointed with others. Rare's titles in particular have under-whelmed me, mostly because I had such high expectations. Looking forward to GRAW and Oblivion. As for PS3, not too excited yet, but I expect I will be come E3. For the record, I'm most excited about Revolution."</p></li>
