THQ will be publishing a brand new turn-based strategy game based on the popular Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game. <i>Warhammer 40,000: Squad Command</i> is currently in development for both the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP.<br />
<br />
THQ has seen recent success with the Warhammer 40k franchise, most notably with the real-time strategy game for PC, <i>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</i>. They also purchased the rights to a Warhammer 40k MMO, and they're now doing their part in bringing the franchise to handhelds.<br />
<br />
Squad Command's single player campaign contains thirteen unique and cinematically-driven missions where players control the human Space Marines of the Ultramarines chapter in a war against the evil Chaos Space Marines.<br />
<br />
The multiplayer portion of the game features nine different maps ranging in sizes suitable for anywhere from two to eight players. Players can choose between either the Imperium of Man or the Chaos Space Marines as they face off in both local and online multiplayer.<br />
<br />
There is no word yet on a release date.
