Electronic Arts gave the official word today that <i>Medal of Honor Heroes 2</i> will arrive on Wii this holiday.  The game will feature a single player campaign as well as a 32-player online mode where players can jump into the battle at any time. <br />
<br />
The Wii version will support the Wii Zapper peripheral that was announced at the recent Electronic Entertainment Expo.  Although the game is also being brought to the Sony PSP (the original Medal of Honor Heroes was released for the portable), the Wii version will contain an exclusive on-rails shooter mode that EA says is "designed specifically for the Wii that simplifies gameplay for players of all skills levels for easy pick-up-and-play action."
