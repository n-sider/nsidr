Amid a slew of recent Midway <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2896">game </a> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2897">announcements</a>, Midway unveiled <i>The Bee Game</i> for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance.<br />
<br />
The Bee Game is based on the adventures of Maya the Bee and her friend Willie (another bee) as they search for the rest of their friends who were lost during a strong storm in a corn poppy meadow. Maya and Willie will complete challenges and take on mini-games to discover the mystery of their friends' disappearance. Players will search for their bee brethren among the meadow, dark forest, blue pond, deep caverns, and the garden.<br />
<br />
Maya the Bee may be unfamiliar to U.S. audiences. The original children's book, translated as <i>The Adventures of Maya the Bee</i>, was written by German Waldemar Bonsels and published in 1912. Since then, it has been published in a variety of other foreign territories  and spawned both a live-action film in 1924 and an anime series in 1975 that was dubbed for other countries, including the United States. With the film's restoration in 2005 and a mobile game release last year, the DS game seems to be continuing a recent emergence for the Maya the Bee brand.<br />
<br />
The Bee Game is due for a release this November.
