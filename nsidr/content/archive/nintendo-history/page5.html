</div></div><span class="dropcap">T</span>he development division was divided in 1979 officially to each of the original chief engineers. Gunpei Yokoi was assigned to manage Nintendo R&D1, Masayuki Uemura headed Nintendo R&D2, and Genyo Takeda headed Nintendo R&D3. At this time a young-punk Shigeru Miyamoto stumbled into NCL's offices and got his first job as a designer for Yokoi's R&D1 division. Miyamoto started by drawing some promotional artwork, but because of the shortage of creative designers at Nintendo, Miyamoto was catapulted into designing graphics for the arcade shooter titled Radarscope by Nintendo R&D1.  <br />
<br />
Gunpei Yokoi was very pleased with his young apprentice and assigned him the lead design duties of the next batch of arcade titles, which included Donkey Kong, and Mario Bros.. Uemura and Takeda had their own divisions, but they still handled more technical stuff and hardly released major software.<br />
<br />
Big important year. The Famicom was looming. Miyamoto got a lot of attention thanks to Donkey Kong. Around this time Nintendo made plans to have a pure software development division under Shigeru Miyamoto. R&D4 was going to be the newest addition to the NCL family. Also R&D2 and R&D3 began developing commercial software. Not only was R&D4 being established (now known as EAD), but R&D1 made up the loss of Miyamoto by hiring a bunch of new employees.<br />
<br />
R&D1's new members included Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano, Toru Osawa, who became the leaders of a small cult called Team Shikamaru. Team Shikamaru went on to create Balloon Fight (the only non-story heavy game), Metroid, Kid Icarus, Detective Club, Three Person Galaxy, and Tokimeki High School. All paved way for the first story-heavy or dramatically themed NCL software. Hitoshi Yamagami who worked with Yokoi on the later Game & Watch software paved way for Nintendo's puzzlers like Tetris, Alleyway, Doctor Mario, Mahjong. With Yokoi and Okada pioneering the Game Boy, R&D1 hired a rookie staff to make its first "leading software". The team of Hirofumi Matsuoka and Takehiko Hosokawa went on to create the Super Mario Land series, which eventually evolved to Wario Land.<br />
<br />
Miyamoto's new team was going to focus on blockbuster software exclusively for the Famicom, while Yokoi's team was split between Famicom and eventually Game Boy Software. R&D1's absence from major arcade development, greenlighted former dormant R&D2 and R&D3 to get a shot at creating arcade games. R&D3 ended up creating a very special arcade franchise revolving around boxing, which reappeared in different form 3 years later on the NES.<br />

Each of the above would link to their respective hardware or software profiles. Instead of writing text for which is Japan, North America, etc...we could color code them or probably more suitable would have it split into three sections.
