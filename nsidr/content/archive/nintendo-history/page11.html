</div></div><b>Nintendo R&D1</b><br />
The original game development team at Nintendo. Originally created in the 1970s by Hiroshi Imanishi as the "games division" of Nintendo Co., Ltd. The ambitious and imaginitive Gunpei Yokoi was the original engineer and inventor designated to create electronic toys and arcade coin-up software. When Hiroshi Yamauchi appointed Yokoi to manage Nintendo R&D1, the team was asked to create popular arcade software to rival the booming market. While the group originally engineered electronic love testers, its first official software appeared in 1979 with Radarscope. Arcade hits like Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Mario Bros. followed shortly after. In 1980, Gunpei Yokoi was inspired to create the Game&Watch, and the team developed several games for the format including Ball, Black Jack, Chef, Climber, Crab Grab, Egg, Snoopy, Mickey Mouse and several others. With the conception of the Famicom, and Game Boy, the group was reassigned to concentrate on developing the premier software for console and portable gaming straying away from their original toys, Game & Watch, and arcade roots. Not only is this division famous for the pioneering venture of software and hardware development, but it gave birth to one of the first scenario writing teams in video game history, Team Shikamaru, made up of Makoto Kanoh, Toru Osawa, and Yoshio Sakamoto. This small club within Nintendo R&D1 was responsible for writing stories and designing characters found in several games like Metroid, Kid Icarus, Balloon Kid, Famicom Tantei Club, and others. Upon the unfortunate departure of Gunpei Yokoi, the division was run under Takehiro Izushi until 2002. With several key personnel retiring and seeking other positions within Nintendo and Nintendo-affiliates, the division began dwindling. By the end of 2002, Nintendo R&D1 ceased to exist, but several key members including Yoshio Sakamoto and most of the Metroid Fusion and Wario Land team went on to form Nintendo Software Planning & Development Group No. 1. While the team exists with a very small staff, they have been very active in introducing new franchises like Rhythm Heaven and Tomodachi Collection while still continuing the Metroid and Wario Ware franchises.<br />

This group mainly concentrated on hardware technology and system operating tools. Masayuki Uemura was hired away from Sharp Corporation where he specialized in solar cell technology. The solar technology fueled the original bean gun games which Nintendo introduced to huge success. The team would go on to develop several peripherals and eventually even some video game software. The team generally assisted Nintendo R&D1 and Nintendo R&D3 with their arcade games, but they also became the first team to specialize in software ports at Nintendo with the task of porting all the original arcade titles like Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, and Popeye to the Famicom<br />

</div></div><b>Nintendo R&D3</b><br />
Manager Genyo Takeda was described by Shigeru Miyamoto as "the first game designer" at Nintendo. Although Genyo Takeda was originally hired by Nintendo as a hardware engineer, Takeda managed to moonlight and create software on the same arcade boards being designed for Gunpei Yokoi's R&D1 team. Nintendo R&D3 managed to release the first arcade game ever published by Nintendo, titled EVR Race. The group would then go on to develop several other arcade games like Sheriff, Space Firebird, Punch-Out!! and Arm Wrestling. After a short-hiatus developing Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System related technology, the team returned to game development and produced a variety of unique software for the NES that was mainly aimed at the Western market, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out and StarTropics to name a few. The team's last game developed was the 1993 sequel, Super Punch-Out, on the Super Nintendo. Around 1995, the group was officially renamed Nintendo Integrated Research & Development, and has concentrated on hardware related technology exclusively.<br />

</div></div><b>Nintendo R&D4</b><br />
With the worldwide success of Donkey Kong and Mario Bros. in the arcades, Nintendo decided to surround it's newest software development team around star designer Shigeru Miyamoto. The relatively young team began working on a couple of new projects exclusively for the Famicom. The success of Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda propelled the sales and notoriety of the Nintendo brand into a household name. The division has evolved into the premier and biggest R&D group at Nintendo, and possibly within the game industry.<br />

</div></div><b>Nintendo Tokyo R&D</b><br />
In the early 1980's, Nintendo planned to expand software R&D into the Tokyo manufacturing branch building to operate alongside its overcrowded Kyoto headquarters. The initial plans became delayed and shortly after the development of the original Mother, the group ceased development.<br />

</div></div><b>Nintendo Special Projects</b><br />
The first development branch at Nintendo of America was created in 1990 as Nintendo Special-Projects Group. The team was originally assembled during localization and NOA production of the Nintendo R&D3 developed, Star Tropics. Minoru Arakawa and Howard Phillips closely oversaw the production of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out and Star Tropics and their significance as North American targeted software. The success of the software prompted Arakawa and Lincoln to facilitate more Nintendo software aimed at the tastes of American consumers. Since Nintendo of America did not have internal programmers and designers, they assembled an in-house staff of product analysts, testers, and localization producers to lead a design and planning group operating towards software under the  Nintendo of America brand. The development group's main goal was to come up with concepts, ideas, and licenses that could find exclusive success with its target demograph. <br />
<br />
Nintendo Special-Group's first internal project was NES Open Play Action Football. The licence and concept was headed by Jeff Hutt, with NOA's Brian Ullrich and Paul Lange handling lead game design. The game itself was programmed by a Japanese freelancer hired by Nintendo for the project. This game would set the prototype of how most games were developed by Nintendo Special-Projects Group. First the licenses were acquired, NFL, Ken Griffey and the MLB, Kobey Bryant and the NBA. Then Nintendo would appoint a few producers and designers from NOA to work with an external studio to develop the project. <br />
<br />
The division was ceased sometime around 1995 with the key departure of several of the producers to other companies. <br />
