Company Structure Summary<br />
<br />
Death of the beloved Famicom. Nintendo began development of its 16-bit console, the Super Famicom. Although, the original and biggest development group, Nintendo R&D1 was no longer the king of the jungle. Mr. Miyamoto and team released nothing but million sellers in Japan (with the exception of Doki Doki Panic). Yokoi's main success was now the Game Boy while Miyamoto's was the Famicom. With that directive, resources between the two top software developers shifted. While R&D1 began a downward spiral of staff decreases, R&D4 became massive. Miyamoto's R&D4 team became the head honcho and got to spend 100 percent of its resources on the Super Famicom. Around this time, Miyamoto renamed his division to EAD.
