<center><H3>N-Sider Presents...<br>
.: Nintendo - A Legendary Tale :.</h3></center>

<p>The staff of N-Sider has spent the last half decade of our lives chronicling the exciting and emotional history of Nintendo Co., Ltd.  It may be difficult for some to understand just why we place so much dedication and time into what is assumed-to-be a corporate money-fueled being.  Nintendo however, is not a faceless entity.  Nintendo's vibrant soul can be seen in the talent and creativity it unleashes with nearly everything it makes.  We wish to extend thanks to Nintendo for all the joy and comfort it has provided us through the years we grew up and continues to do today.  From this article (and furthermore, the N-Sider site itself) we hope you'll grow to appreciate Nintendo's past, present, and as a consequence, its future too!</p>

<p>Our goal when we started creating this was to provide a paradise for Nintendo fans as well a resource for those who require research or for those who simply wish expand their intellect and become the ultimate Nintendo expert. Whatever your need or goal might be, this is the most organized and comprehensive gathering of Nintendo related info on the world wide web and possibly, on the world itself.</p>

<p>Time has a tendency to deteriorate the things we most cherish. We hope to preserve Nintendo's rich history and archive it for the years to come.  There are many <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/n-database-thanks">"Thank You's"</a> that must be given.  That list is by no means comprehensive.  As you can understand, this would not have been possible without the help and inspiration of so many people. We sincerely thank you all.</p>
