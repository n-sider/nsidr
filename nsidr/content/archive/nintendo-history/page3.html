</div></div><span class="dropcap">H</span>iroshi Imanishi convinced Hiroshi Yamauchi in the mid 70s to gear Nintendo towards the emerging markets of electronics and gadgets. Nintendo began hiring engineers and programmers. It was with this goal in mind that Imanishi pioneered the first electronic-software division at Nintendo simply titled: Nintendo Development Division. The group was led by engineers Gunpei Yokoi, Masayuki Uemura and Genyo Takeda.<br />

<div class="indent"><b>1968 - Yamauchi Acquires a Sidekick</b><br />
Nintendo hired a young man named Hiroshi Imanishi who had recently graduated from Doshisha University. Mr. Yamauchi's audacious confidence and demeanor impressed the young Imanishi. In their meetings together, Imanishi would become Yamauchi's outlet. Mr. Imanishi would become all ears and soak in Yamauchi's vision -- his ideas and thoughts on how he planned to mold Nintendo's future.<br />
<br />
<b>1969 - Hiroshi Imanishi Transforms Nintendo</b><br />
During his first several years at Nintendo, Mr. Imanishi would jump around working in several different departments including administration, planning, and finance. Imanishi's opinion and also his already diverse work within Nintendo was very valuable to Yamauchi and so to reflect this, Imanishi was named Nintendo General Affairs Manager. In 1969, Yamauchi told Imanishi he would be responsible for creating a new Nintendo Research & Development unit in a warehouse in Uji, Kyoto, Japan. The group became known as "Games".<br />
<br />
<b>1970 - The Legend of Gunpei Yokoi Begins</b><br />
After graduating from college with a degree in electronics, Gunpei Yokoi set out immediately to find a job. He turned in applications at several companies in the Kyoto area. Nintendo ultimately hired Yokoi to maintain its assembly line of playing cards. Yokoi was a very hard and loyal worker and ran the maintenance department all by himself for several months. Mr. Yamauchi had a talent for spotting what he calls "visionaries". Yamauchi realized there was something very special about Yokoi. He called Yokoi into his office one day and told him that he would now be assigned to Mr. Imanishi's newly formed Games division. Within the Games division, Yokoi was given the responsibility of creating an Engineering Department. Gunpei was expected to begin work immediately creating something for Nintendo to sell during the Christmas season.<br />
<br />
On his own time, Yokoi had created a device called the Ultra Hand. It allowed users to grip two handles and by pinching them together, the other end would pinch together acting almost like an extended hand. Yokoi presented the device to Yamauchi and Imanishi the next day. Both were impressed and Yamauchi gave Imanishi and Yokoi the go-ahead for production.  The device ultimately sold over 1.2 million units.<br />
<br />
<b>1971 - Gunpei's Imagination Blossoms</b><br />
After the success of the Ultra Hand, Gunepi set his mind to creating more innovative toys which came to be known under the "Ultra" name. The next big hit (literally) that came from Gunpei was called the Ultra Machine. It was a light-weight version of a baseball-pitching machine that allowed kids to play baseball indoors. Another hit in the Ultra series of toys was called the Ultra Scope. With the use of reflecting mirrors, it allowed kids to peak around corners or over fences. Gunpei used his education in electronics to eventually create the "Love Tester". The device involved a girl and a boy grabbing ahold of the device's handles and then locking their other hands together. The machine tested how much "love" that was flowing between them (which, in reality, was just a small electric current).<br />
<br />
<b>1972 - Masayuki Uemura's Affair with Nintendo</b><br />
Masayuki Uemura, a sales associate from Sharp, visited Nintendo one day to sell optical semiconductors traditionally used in solar cells. After several conversations, Gunpei Yokoi convinced Uemura to join Nintendo. Using the solar cell technology from Sharp, Uemura and Yokoi began developing the Nintendo Beam Gun. The Beam Gun light gun would be used to shoot at various light-sensitive objects, that would react according to either make noise or fall apart. The Beam Guns sold over 1 million units. Nintendo was quickly proving itself as a huge innovator. Nintendo was growing rapidly and the company became listed in the first section of the Osaka Stock Exchange. Yamauchi realized he required more space for his fast-growing company. He set about buying surrounding buildings and a vacant lot next to the Hanafuda Card Factory. Three brand new three-story buildings were constructed next to the factory. The new buildings, though simple in appearance, were more modern and would assist Nintendo durig its growth.<br />
<br />
<b>1973 - Laser Clay Shooting Sets Nintendo on New Path</b><br />
Yokoi suggested to Hiroshi Yamauchi that the technology used in the Beam Gun Games could be used in other ways. Yokoi had recently bought a rifle and visited a skeet shooting range. He walked away with the brilliant idea of using the light gun system used in the Beam Gun Games to simulate shooting clay pigeons. Yamauchi thought intently about this idea. In the 1960s, bowling had been a popular sport in Japan but interest had eventually waned leaving many of the buildings that bowling alleys once resided in empty. Yamauchi believed they could renovate these bowling alleys into electronic shooting ranges with simulated clay pigeons. The Sharp solar cell technology would be used to detect when the targets were hit.<br />
<br />
A few technical problems were initially experienced while getting the system running. Recently hired engineer, Genyo Takeda, assisted Yokoi in the production of the unit. Bugs were thought to have been ironed out for the grand opening in Kyoto. A television crew was on hand to film the opening. Yokoi and Takeda suddenly found out there had been a malfunction with the unit. While the cameras were filming, Takeda hid in a box behind the targets and activated the clay pigeons manually. The Laser Clay Shooting Range became a hot new evening entertainment venue and several others were quickly constucted.<br />
<br />
<b>1974 - Wild Gunman Brings Concerns For a Future</b><br />
Nintendo introduced an image projection system using 16 mm film. The game using this technology was called Wild Gunman. Players were placed in a western backdrop where they had to shoot an opposing gunman before he could get off a shot. The unit was exported to both Europe and the United States. The world was set into panic with the 1973 oil shortage that affected economies worldwide. The once crowded shooting ranges now became deserted and orders for units were cancelled. Yamauchi needed desperately to get a new product to market.</div>
