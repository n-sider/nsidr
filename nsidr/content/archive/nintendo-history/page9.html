According to Nintendo of America, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time raked in approximate retail revenues of $150 million from the nearly 2.5 million units sold at an average retail price of $60. The top grossing movie for the same time period was the Disney/Pixar production of A Bug's Life, with approximately $114 million in box office receipts. Ocarina of Time also gained the distinction of becoming the fastest selling game of all time and the number one selling video game of 1998, even though it was available for only the last 39 days of the year.<br />
