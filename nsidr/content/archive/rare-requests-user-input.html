Rare has posted a message asking users to send in suggestions of what games they would like to see on the Nintendo DS.  It reads: "Given recent confirmation that Rare will be supporting the Nintendo DS, what projects do you hope or expect to see from us on this system? Is there anything you don't want to see?"  The website can be found <a href="http://rareware.com/extra/pantsboard/all_pants.html">here</a>.
