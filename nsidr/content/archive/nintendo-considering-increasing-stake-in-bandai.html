<p>During the same investor meeting you've likely already seen many articles about this week, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata also commented on his interest in increasing Nintendo's investment in Bandai.  Nintendo currently holds a 2.6 percent share in Bandai, which currently makes Nintendo the ninth largest shareholder.  No specific intention or amount of a further investment was mentioned.</p>
