<p>IBM, developer of the Wii processor chip dubbed Broadway, issued a statement today to confirm its shipment of Broadway chips to Nintendo.  "The first chips are in our possession," said <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a>, senior managing director for Nintendo's Integrated Research and Development Division.</p>

<p>The chips are being produced at IBM's 300mm semiconductor development and manufacturing facility in East Fishkill, New York, and have apparently been in production since July.  "We have been shipping well within this quarter (July)," Ron Martino, director of IBM Technology Collaboration Solutions, told Joystiq.com. "In fact, we have shipped a significant volume in this quarter."</p>

<p>IBM previously designed and produced the Gekko chip used in the Nintendo GameCube console released in September 2001.  The company reveals the new Broadway chip is 20 percent more power-efficient.  No other technical details were divulged.  Nintendo of America is holding a media event on September 14, where the stage is set for the revelation of more Wii news.</p>
