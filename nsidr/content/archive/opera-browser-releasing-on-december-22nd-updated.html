With the release of the Forecast Channel earlier today, news has begun surfacing as to when the Opera (Internet Channel) browser will finally be released.<br />
<br />
According to <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/devices/nintendo/">Opera's own website</a>, Friday, December 22nd is the day. While this initial release is only a beta, it is completely free to download and use. Sites like Youtube and N-Sider, as well as most other pages on the internets, will be viewable. The Opera browser on Wii does not support Java, so expect a few bugs here and there.<br />
<br />
Mid-way into next year (around June), the final version of Opera will be released. Anyone who hasn't downloaded it by then can expect to pay 500 points for the browser software.<br />
<br />
<b>Update</b> by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=40">Matt</a>: Breaking news just now crossing the wires indicates that Nintendo of America is on-board with the December 22 release as well.  NOA has also confirmed that after June, the Internet Channel will be available for 500 Wii Points.
