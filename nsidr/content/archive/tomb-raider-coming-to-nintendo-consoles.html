<p>IGN has word that Eidos <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/699/699529p1.html">will bring <i>Tomb Raider: Legend</i></a> to the GameCube as well as ports for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, though they have yet to pin a date on the effort &mdash; only saying they're looking at 2006.</p>

<p>IGN speculates that 300,000-strong sales for <i>LEGO Star Wars</i> on the GameCube might be in part behind this decision to bring Lara Croft to Nintendo consoles.  Eidos says the title will not be playable at E3 2006.</p>

<p>Eidos was also asked about their Revolution plans.  The reply, by Eidos North America's president and CEO Bill Gardner: "It is Eidos' intention to support all platforms in appropriate specific markets. What does this mean? It means that when it makes good business sense for the company to do so, we will bring our franchises to certain platforms in specific regional markets. Should we believe that it makes good business sense to bring our titles or franchises to the Revolution platform, we will certainly do so, with the approval from Nintendo, of course."</p>
