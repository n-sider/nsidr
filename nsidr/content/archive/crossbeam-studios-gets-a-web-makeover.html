<p>Indie-developer Crossbeam Studios has launched a new design for its company <a href="http://www.crossbeamstudios.com/">website</a>.  The studio has been working on interactive entertainment for several years and is hoping to release their first title dubbed Orb for Wii.  The game is described as an action adventure in the same vein as The Legend of Zelda.  Although Crossbeam Studios is currently trying to locate a publisher, the group expects to have a demo ready to show the public later this year.  Of course, updates on this and more can be found on the company's <a href="http://www.crossbeamstudios.com/">website</a>.</p>
