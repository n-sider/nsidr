Adding to the recent <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=day&date=2007-04-23">release revelations</a>, Nintendo's end-of-fiscal-year et-ceteras brought a <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/784/784665p1.html">more substantial list</a> of Wii releases planned for the company's home country this year.<br />
<br />
Notable on this list is <i>Project H.A.M.M.E.R.</i>, the NST-developed robot-smashing simulator that little has been heard about since its debut in Nintendo's booth at E3 2006.  Astute readers will also note Nintendo isn't actually putting dates on any of these titles yet except one:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>DK Bongo Blast</i> (June 28)</li>
  <li><i>Wii Health Pack</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Disaster: Day of Crisis</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Mario Party 8</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Project H.A.M.M.E.R.</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Wii Music</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Battalion Wars II</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Forever Blue</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Mario Strikers Charged</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  <li><i>Mario and Sonic at the Olympics</i> (TBA 2007)</li>
  </ul><br />
Perhaps most surprising is that Nintendo seems to intend to last all of 2007 with only two entries (three if you really reach and count the Japanese version of <i>Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree</i>) in the popular "Wii" series&mdash;which, as the analog to the DS's Brain Training series, made up a not-insignificant portion of Japanese game sales.
