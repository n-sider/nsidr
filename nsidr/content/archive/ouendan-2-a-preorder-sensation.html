New York-based importer <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</a> noted this week that the upcoming sequel to cult import hit <i>Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan</i>, <i>Burn! Hot-Blooded Rhythm Soul! Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2</i> is leading preorders for the week&mdash;by a lot.<br />
<br />
NCS told us that among their preorders in recent years, Ouendan 2 is right up there with <i>Jump Super Stars</i> and <i>Jump Ultimate Stars</i>, having matched the preorder numbers for the former&mdash;something that took them by surprise, as they didn't expect Ouendan 2 to be as widely known as Jump Super Stars.  However, it didn't rise to the challenge of toppling their top preorder seller of all time: the Dreamcast version of <i>Ikaruga</i>.<br />
<br />
The original Ouendan's import success caught the eyes of Nintendo, who had developer iNiS create an all-new version for North American audiences: the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=558">magnificent</a> <i>Elite Beat Agents</i>.  Ouendan 2 will be released in Japan this Thursday, May 17.
