Nintendo told Wired's Chris Kohler today that the <i>Nintendo Channel</i>&#8212;previously known by its Japanese moniker, the <i>Everybody's Nintendo Channel</i>&#8212;is going to be downloadable alongside WiiWare next month.<br />
<br />
The channel will sport user reviews for WiiWare titles to help consumers separate the wheat from the chaff amongst the Wild West of WiiWare, where anything goes, as Nintendo has said.  Additional features of the channel include upcoming game lists and downloadable DS demos.<br />
