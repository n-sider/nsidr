Imagine transporting yourself back in time to 1989 with all the gaming know-how you've accumulated through years of wasting your life away, and then being inexplicably hired at Konami to revamp their <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> arcade game to make it totally sweet.<br />

You'd probably not have the technology for it, but the game you'd come up with would be Castle Crashers&#8212;which seems to be quite frankly the new definitive example of the genre.  It's <i>Final Fight</i> meets <i>River City Ransom</i> meets <i>Hungry Hungry Hippos</i> meets <i>high definition animated mammals literally shitting themselves</i>.   Castle Crashers incorporates fast action, ridiculous combos, independent experience levels for a host of characters far too large to ever be fully used, and allocatable points for upgrades that will turn your character into a physical powerhouse, lumbering tank, or devastating ranged magic user.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
The game retains the pencil-outline look of <i>Alien Hominid HD</i>, and the entire game is peppered with music that feels like it was pulled out of Disney's canceled animated version of <i>The Matrix</i>.  It all goes down in a sea of color for those of you with nicely-tuned displays.<br />
<br />
Castle Crashers is special, though, because what it does is it uses the current gaming market to really refine and present an example of a game belonging to an aging/aged/dead genre.  It says "Look at me you saucy fools, I am all you had hoped I could be!"  Even the four main characters have their own Ninja Turtley colors.<br />
<br />
<i>Castle Crashers</i> isn't coming out on the Wii (that we know of), but any self-respecting Xbox360 owner owes it to themselves to take a look at this quaint little 4-players-simultaneously gem.<br />
<br />
For ten bucks and a finsky you could either get a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and some sides, or what is likely the best side-scrolling 4-player beat-'em-up ever made!  <i>For thirty you could get it all.</i>
