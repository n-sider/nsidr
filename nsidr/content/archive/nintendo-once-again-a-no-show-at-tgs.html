The Tokyo Game Show 2007 is coming up&mdash;and once again, Nintendo has opted to not be an exhibitor at the four-day event, held from September 20 through 23.<br />
<br />
TGS is <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6622&Itemid=2">bigger than it has ever been</a>, surpassing last year's size.  This year, 168 exhibitors will have 1,708 booths.  The fourth day is new to the show this year, probably in response to the scaled-down nature of E3.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://expo.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2007/english/attendee_info/exhibitors.html">full list of exhibitors</a> is available at the TGS site.
