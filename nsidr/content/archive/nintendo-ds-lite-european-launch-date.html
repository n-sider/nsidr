<p><a href="http://www.ds-x2.com/index.php?id=4876">DS-X2</a> has noticed that 

several German online retailers have the Nintendo DS Lite listed for an 

August 16, 2006 release for 129.99 Euros.  It would be surprising 

considering UK general manager <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=991">David 

Yarnton</a>, mentioned in an interview with <a 

href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=62609&page=2">Eurogamer</a> a few weeks ago that "we haven't got any plans at the moment [for a 

Nintendo DS redesign]. Nothing I know of."  Props to Nintendo Europe if 

they've ironed out a release plan this quickly.  The three launch colors 

listed by the German websites are the same as those in Japan -- Crystal 

White, Enamel Navy and Ice Blue.  Given this information, it's best to wait 

for an official announcement from Nintendo Europe.</p>
