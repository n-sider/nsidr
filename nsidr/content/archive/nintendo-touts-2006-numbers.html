2006 has come to a close, with the release of Wii and hotly-anticipated Legend of Zelda installment <i>Twilight Princess</i>, and Nintendo of America is right there with fun facts about their  holiday period sales.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Every single Wii console shipped to retail in 2006 sold.  (This should come as no surprise to those hunting for the elusive hardware, even today.)  The number Nintendo brings to the table is "more than a million", which actually sounds rather small compared to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2577">1.8 million</a>.</li>
  <li>Over 1.5 million extra Wii "controllers" (including both Remotes and Nunchuks) were sold.</li>
  <li>Nintendo DS sold 1.6 million units in December to customers, wrapping up the year at 5.3 million units.</li>
  <li>The aforementioned Zelda title sold enough units to be in 86% of Wii buyers' libraries, moving over 900,000 copies.  The GameCube version of same added around another 600,000 copies.  Together they made up one of the year's top five games.</li>
  <li>Wii owners picked up an average of three additional titles (beyond the packed-in <i>Wii Sports</i>) for their systems.</li>
  <li><i>New Super Mario Bros</i> and <i>Brain Age</i> were top-ten sellers for the year.</li>
  <li>In November and December, Nintendo accounted for over half of all video game hardware sold in America.</li>
  </ul>
