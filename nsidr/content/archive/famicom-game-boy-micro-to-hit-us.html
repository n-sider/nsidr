<p>Planet GameCube has received word from Nintendo of America that <a href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/news.cfm?action=item&id=6633">the Famicom Game Boy micro</a> is headed, inexplicably, for a US release.</p>

<p>The system and faceplate are styled in a manner reminiscent of the Japanese Famicom, which the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=3">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> was based on.  Although hardcore Nintendo-followers will no doubt be very interested in this piece, it will most likely puzzle most buyers.</p>

<p>The edition will be available November 28 for $99.99, and will come with a $10 coupon usable for select Nintendo-published Game Boy Advance games; presumably the coupon is a hook to get the system moving in markets that don't have the faintest clue what the Famicom is.</p>
