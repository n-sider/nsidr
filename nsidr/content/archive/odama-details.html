<ul>
<li><i>Odama</i> is a tentative title.</li>
<li><i>Odama</i> takes place durring the Japanese feudal wars.</li>
<li>Gamers use the flippers to send the pinball called <i>Odama</i> to destory enemy barracks and turrets. Hitting enemy soldiers captures them and makes them join your army.</li>
<li>If you're not careful you'll crush your own troops.</li>
<li>Players progress to the next level by gaining more territory and assaulting the enemies gate.</li>
<li>Your actions can result in your troops losing confidence in you and your abilities, they will then become complacent.</li>
<li>A second player can use the DK Bongo controllers to speed up and urge soldiers onwards. The troops will lose confidence in the 1st player if this occurs.</li>
<li>A second player can step in and control your troops instead of allowing them to make their own decisions.</li>
<li>As you progress your troops will need to liberate additional flippers, dam rivers and clear the way to the enemies gate.</li>
<li><i>Odama</i> is being developed by VIVARIUM Inc.</li>
