<p><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060329/sheffield_01.shtml">Gamasutra</a> has published an interview with Pandemic CEO Josh Resnick.  He answers several questions relating to Nintendo's next-generation home console codenamed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a>.</p>   

<p>Resnick admits the company is "enthralled" with all three next-generation platforms from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo.  He's looked at each of the consoles and recognizes that they have unique strengths for the company's games to utilize.  However, he clarifies that no "commitments" have been made thus far.</p>

<p>"Well the Revolution is a very different platform, and we've actually just seen some things behind closed doors that are just mind-blowing," he confessed.  "Very very exciting. They're doing something that's very different and unique."</p>

<p>Resnick also doesn't see major difficulties with Revolution development.  However, he does feel it will take more effort when porting software to the Revolution.  "...I agree that it's going to challenge the notion of just doing a port," he said.  "I think we are going to be looking to see how we can tailor our products to that platform.  But we do that also with other platforms as well, it's just that the Revolution may challenge us even more."</p>

<p>You may recall that earlier this month, <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/696/696869p1.html">IGN.com</a> spoke with Greg Borrud, Pandemic Studios' director of production.  He also expressed sincere excitement in development games for the Revolution as well as concern regarding multi-platform development.  "The challenge will be in our approach to these games," he told IGN.  "As we think about the Xbox 360 and the PS3 we see a lot of similarities between the systems so it will be relatively easy to have a game ship on both platforms. We don't necessarily see those kinds of similarities with the Revolution. Games that are made for the Revolution will really have to be re-conceived for that platform and can't simply be a port. While on the one hand that could mean fewer games for the Revolution, the games that do ship on the platform will probably be crafted with a lot more thought and care than would go into your average port. So yes, we are interested in developing entertainment for the Revolution - but only for the select group of games that really make sense."</p>
