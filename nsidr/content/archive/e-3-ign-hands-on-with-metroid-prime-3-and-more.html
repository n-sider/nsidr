<p>IGN.com was given 10 minutes to sit down and play Metroid Prime 3 for Nintendo Wii.  An excerpt is below while the full story can be read <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/706/706030p1.html">here</a>.

"...The fastest 10 minutes of my life were spent playing Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. When it was all over, I was reluctant t leave. The Nintendo people handling the demo first informed me that my time was up. I continued playing. They then asked me to finish up. I kept playing. Finally, they told me that I had to end the session and I begrudgingly agreed to accommodate their demands. It's a shame because I left the demo really liking some parts of Prime 3 and totally unsure about other portions. If I could have only had another half hour, or perhaps six hours, with the game, everything would surely be clear..."
