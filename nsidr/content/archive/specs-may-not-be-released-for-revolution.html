Nintendo's Senior Director of European Marketing, Jim Merrick has gone on record once again, this time claiming that Revolution's technical specs may never be released to the public.
<br>
<br>
<i>"Regarding the specifications, we will probably never 'release' this information as we feel that it is largely irrelevant. While some of our competitors enjoy comparing specifications, it has little or nothing to do with how satisfied the consumers will be with the system and the games once they are released."</i>
