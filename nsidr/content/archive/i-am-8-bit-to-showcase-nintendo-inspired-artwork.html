<p><a href="http://games.ign.com/articles/700/700977p1.html">IGN.com</a> partnered with the boys and girls at <a href="http://www.iam8bit.net/">IAm8-bit</a> to host an art contest and award the winning entry a showcase at the I AM 8-BIT exhibition on April 18 in Los Angeles.  All entries generated their inspiration from the 8-bit era of video games.  One grand prize was awarded with nine runner-ups.</p>

<p>Entries range from the very strange to the tenaciously cool.  They each provide a nice statement to our video game culture.  So put your back into it and check out the enigmatic <a href="http://games.ign.com/articles/700/700977p1.html">line-up of winning art</a>.</p>

<p>The first I AM 8-Bit exhibition was held in May 2005 during the Electronic Entertainment Expo.  Over a hundred artists contributed a variety of video game inspired artwork.  Take a look at last year's show <a href="http://www.fixins.com/8bit/8bit.html">here</a>.</p>
