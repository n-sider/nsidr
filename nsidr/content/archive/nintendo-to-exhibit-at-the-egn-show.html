<p>The European ECTS show has competition in the form of the European Games Network (EGN).  While Nintendo announced it would sponsor the ECTS bar earlier this week, Nintendo today announced it would attend and exhibit at EGN.  The two events will be taking place during the same time-frame - September 1 through 3.  This is causing confusion between media and retailers as to which event they should focus on.</p>

<p><blockquote>

"The games industry is putting its weight behind EGN, as is proven by the list of heavyweight publishers and development studios who have already confirmed as exhibitors," said general director of ELSPA Roger Bennett.  "In our opinion, other organisations are being extremely liberal with the facts. That's up to them; they are the ones who will have to deal with the consequences of their actions. However, no one wants anyone in the industry, whether they are travelling internationally or domestically to be misled. We would therefore urge people in the strongest possible terms not to be distracted by the claims of others. The games industry will be at EGN in September."

<p>The sponsors of ECTS would likely say the same thing about their event.  We'll let you know more about these shows and Nintendo's involvement as the dates approach.</p>
