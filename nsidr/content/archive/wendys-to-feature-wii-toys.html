Starting this week, Wendy's International (all Wendy's restaurants in North America) will be featuring "Wii Toys" with their Kid's Meals.<br />
<br />
With every Kid's Meal purchase, you'll be able to choose from one of five toys:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li> A Wii disc shooter</li>
  <li> A Two Sided puzzle</li>
  <li> A Miniature Excite Truck</li>
  <li> A Miniature Wii-Baseball game</li>
  <li> A Mario on Shell w/ Wii Remote Toy</li>
  </ul><br />
So get to Wendy's and in the spirit of Nintendo: Catch 'em All.
