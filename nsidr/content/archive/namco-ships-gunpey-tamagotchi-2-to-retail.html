Namco Bandai announced that it has shipped two new titles for Nintendo DS today: <i>Gunpey DS</i> and <i>Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop 2</i>.<br />
<br />
Gunpey is a remake of Wonderswan puzzler Gunpey, created by the late <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=536">Gunpei Yokoi</a>.  Tetsuya Mizuguchi's Q Entertainment, developers of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=994"><i>Meteos</i></a>, are behind this project, offering two wildly different versions of the game for the Nintendo DS and for Sony's PlayStation Portable.  The DS version offers an entirely different theme in addition to what sounds like more varied game modes, and in keeping with Mizuguchi's music fusion tradition, a sequencer you can use to create your own tunes.<br />
<br />
Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop 2 is a sequel to third-party <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1749">million-seller</a> <i>Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop</i>.  Gameplay consists of earning points by playing minigames for the various Tamagotchi characters; these points are used to clothe, feed, and care for your Tamagotchis and open new shops.<br />
<br />
It's a little difficult to find either title listed in stores right now&mdash;save the specialty game stores&mdash;but both titles should be arriving soon at a store near you.
