<i>We're counting down to the Wii's launch with a daily look at what retro games we'd like to see on the Virtual Console.  Each also features a Virtual Console Likelihood rating.  A rating of 5 means the game has officially been announced for the service.

Sure, another racing game is making the list, but this is no ordinary racing game.  Players control balls that race from the bottom of a track to the top.  The difference between this and other racers is that the track is a series of floating cylinders stacked on top of each other, and you must grappling-hook your ball from platform to platform, and roll around the platforms to get into the best position to grapple to the next level.  The levels of the track are filled with enemies and other obstacles, and you must jump to avoid them, much like a sidescrolling platformer.<br />

While the gameplay is unique and a little confusing at first, once you get used to the controls and learn what the power-ups do, you're set.  The single player mode is great for learning how to play, but the real addiction sets in with multiplayer.  Up to four people can select their own ball-with-a-personality and cause frantic mayhem on the tracks, using Mario Kart inspired weapons and power-ups against each other in an effort to reach the top first.  The game isn't too long and you're bound to move on to some other racer eventually, but as a Virtual Console download, it would be perfect.  Now we just have to remind Acclaim that this game exists and that we'd like another shot at it.<br />

I first played Wario's Woods when I found it in Animal Crossing on the GameCube.  It was one of the NES cartridges I unlocked with a Pro Action Replay, and it ended up being the only reason I played Animal Crossing for the last few months before I realized I had nothing left to do in the game.  I spent hours on it at a time, trying so hard to beat it, and I still haven't quite gotten good enough yet.  I'm hoping that when I play it with the Wii I'll have gotten better.  Yeah, right.  If anything I'll have to re-tone my reflexes.  The point is, it's a really fun game.  The SNES version has a two-player mode and some extra features, but Nintendo has confirmed that the Wario's Woods we'll be getting on virtual Console is the NES one that came on Animal Crossing.<br />

It's a puzzle game, a bit like Tetris, but more like Tetris Attack.  Units fall from the sky, and they kind of remind me of the viruses (virii?) in Dr. Mario.  Your objective is to take the bombs that fall once in a while and line up four or more of the same coloured unit, with one of the four or more units being a bomb of that colour.  This clears the units.  To do this, you control Toad on the playing field, and make him pick up, kick, and drop the creature-things and bombs wherever you need them to be.  As the pile of units get higher, you ensure that they never reach the top of the screen.  The main obstacle is, every once in a while, Wario shows up and bodyslams the tree you're playing in, causing the top of the playing field to slowly come lower and lower.  During that time, the only units that will be dropped will be creatures instead of the much-needed bombs.  So, best of luck to you as you try it for yourself.  It's fun and it gets very hard.<br />

Every ten levels, you face a boss of some kind.  They are in the playing field with you and to hit them, you have to line up units so that they clear while touching the enemy.  Some enemies move around, and many change the units on the field around.  Again, if your units hit the top of the playing field, you lose.  So, do your best, and eventually you can have a final showdown with Wario and drive him out of the woods.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go try it again, and this time, I intend to beat him!
