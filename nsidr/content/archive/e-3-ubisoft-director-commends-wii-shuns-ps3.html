<p><a href="http://www.nintendojo.com">Nintendojo</a> has posted an interesting little bit on Ubisoft Montreal's (the development house working on the Wii title, <i>Red Steel</i>) creative director, Clint Hocking.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Clint was not one of the Ubisoft Montreal personel giving the <i>Red Steel</i> demonstration at Nintendo's pre-show conference. That was Xavier Poix and Roman Campos.
