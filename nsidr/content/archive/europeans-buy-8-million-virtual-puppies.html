Wondering how Nintendo's been doing across the Atlantic?  Wonder no longer&#8212;Europeans have been making the company a mint by snatching up over <i>8 million</i> copies of <i>Nintendogs</i> since its release.<br />
<br />
The news came alongside the usual suspects making their regular appearances in Nintendo's sales press releases: <i>Wii Play</i> has moved 2.3 million units, <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> 1.3 million, <i>Mario Party 8</i> a million and <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> 1.3 million.  The last two will no doubt come as a comfort to those unsettled by the Party title's Galaxy-trumping peformance in Japan.<br />
