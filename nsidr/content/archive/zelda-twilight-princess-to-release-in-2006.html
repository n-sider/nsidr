Nintendo of America has announced a delay for the release of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i>.  The title was tentatively scheduled for a November 2005 release.  Today Nintendo has confirmed the game will not arrive in retailers until after the first quarter of 2006.

"After much discussion, the Zelda development team has requested extra time to add new levels, more depth and even higher quality to Zelda: Twilight Princess," Nintendo of America's vice president of corporate affairs, Perrin Kaplan, told IGNCube.com. "Consequently, we're announcing a new global launch in 2006, after the conclusion of this fiscal year (March 31).  We'll provide a specific date at a later point in time.  While this may come as a disappointment to many eager fans, it will absolutely enrich the game and make it a multi-million seller."
