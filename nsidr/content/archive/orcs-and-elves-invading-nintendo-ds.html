The award-winning mobile RPG title <i>Orcs & Elves</i> will be making an appearance on the Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
Created by id Software and developed exclusively for EA by Fountainhead Entertainment, Orcs & Elves is a first-person fantasy RPG that first came out for mobile devices. It is now set to be one of the first games developed specifically for a mobile device like a cell phone and brought over to a game-specific device. The DS version of the game is an entirely new version that utilizes the system's strengths, and will feature better graphics, more levels, items, and monsters across the Dwarven kingdom. The game also features a hybrid game style, bringing together first-person action and fast-paced tactical RPG game play together.<br />

Orcs & Elves has not yet been rated and is coming this holiday season.
