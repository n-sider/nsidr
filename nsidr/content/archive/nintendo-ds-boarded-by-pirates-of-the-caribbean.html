<p>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans' Chest, published by Buena Vista Games, is based on the feature film that hits theaters on July 7 of the same name starring Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann as they explore and brawl across land and sea on a search for the legendary Dead Man's Chest.</p>

<b><a href=http://mail.yahoo.com/config/login?/"http://ds.ign.com/articles/715/715999p1.html">IGN</a> says NDS version is (6/10),</b><br>
"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest may borrow its design from successful brawlers, but the developers don't capture the spark that makes those brawlers special. Sure there are tons of moves and combos to unlock, but the enemies don't require any of these earned skills, which sort of defeats the purpose of seeking them out. We will give the developer props for implementing a two player cooperative mode for this beat-em-up, but a wag of the finger for requiring multiple cartridges for those basic (and not all that great) mini-games."

"Hardcore gamers will consider the package simply a passing diversion. For fans of the movie, it's a welcome, but not all-consuming time-waster that lets them relive the swashbuckling tale while unlocking goodies like extra characters, costumes, and concept art. Dead Man's Chest is by no means a clunker, but it's hardly a hidden treasure trove, either."

<b>Nintendo Power says GBA version is (7.5/10),</b><br>
"...it's nice to see that game makers haven't stuffed the GBA into Davy Jones's locker just yet, and that some developers still know that a big-name franchise isn't an excuse to make a half-baked game."
