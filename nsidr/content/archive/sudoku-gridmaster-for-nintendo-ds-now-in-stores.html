<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-06-26-sudokugridmasternintendods.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="Sudoku Gridmaster for Nintendo DS"><a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=180144">Sudoku Gridmaster</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> for $19.99.  The title currently has a 60 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932695.asp?q=sudoku">GameRankings.com</a> (based on six reviews). Sudoku Gridmaster is the latest entry in Nintendo's "<a href="http://us.touchgenerations.com/">Touch Generations</a>" line of casual game software.</p>

<p>Sudoku Gridmaster, published by <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=P-2REUUT2n056n21Vx3p4n3z8Lmq_nd_">Nintendo</a>, is the well-known pen and paper puzzle game turned video game.  Using the touch screen, players can input numbers by writing into individual squares.  One feature that may appeal to veteran Sudoku players includes the ability to highlight multiple squares and input a number into them all at the same time.  Sudoku Gridmaster includes four difficulty settings.</p>

<a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/713/713603p1.html">IGN</a> says (6/10),<br>
"For a game dedicated to the game of Sudoku, it just seems lacking sitting next to a game [Brain Age] that offers a better version as a secondary mode. Sudoku Gridmaster can't even figure a creative way of using the second screen, other than duplicating the same exact grid that's interactive on the touch screen. And I'll freely admit that I'd much rather play Sudoku in the DS vertical "book mode" introduced in Brain Age. I may be spoiled, but Sudoku Gridmaster's is, so far, the weakest entry in Nintendo's much-touted Touch Generations line. If all you want is Sudoku challenges and nothing more, though, that's what you'll get in this cart."

"With a fairly drab presentation and a subpar interface, Sudoku Gridmaster is a pretty weak package. If you're looking for sudoku on the DS, get Brain Age instead. Sudoku isn't the main focus there, but it's put together much, much better."

"The package isn't incredibly fancy, but Sudoku Gridmaster offers an easy way for the uninitiated to learn the ways of Sudoku. There's also a lot of material here for Sudoku enthusiasts to sink their teeth into. The title sells for the discounted price of 20 bucks, and while it's more expensive than buying Sudoku on paper, the package remains a good value for DS owners who enjoy number-based logic puzzles and a sure thing for anyone who likes Sudoku."
