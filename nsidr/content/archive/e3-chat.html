<p>With our E3 staffers frantically running around on the show floor, collecting mountains of information, we thought it'd be nice to give you guys an opportunity to bug them after a long day of work. Originally, we had setup a PHP chat script, but due to the constant refreshing causing concern for seizures (and the fact that it was generally annoying), we've switched to the more reliable IRC way of things.</p>

<p><br>Server: irc.opa-ages.com</br>
<br>Channel: #n-sider</br></p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with IRC, one of our forum moderators, Axord, has written a quick guide on how to use <a href="http://www.hacksrus.com/~ginda/chatzilla/index.html">ChatZilla</a> and IRC in general. You also have the option of using <a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a>, a popular IRC client.</p>

<p><i>Quick dirty guide to IRC</i></p>

<p>If you have Firefox, first get Chatzilla extension here:
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=16">https://addons.mozilla.org/extensio...einfo.php?id=16</a></p>

<p><br>Install, restart. Invoke it from Tools>Chatzilla. Fill in the fields with perhaps useful info.</br>
<br>irc commands start with /</br>
<br>to join a server, type /attach servername</br>
<br>To join a channel within a server, type /join #channelname</br>
<br></br>
<br>So: /attach irc.opa-ages.com</br>
<br>Then: /join #n-sider</br>
<br></br>
