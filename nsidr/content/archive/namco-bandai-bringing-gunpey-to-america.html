<p>Namco Bandai Games has announced today that it will be brining Q Entertainment's <cite>Gunpey</cite> (<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2271">recently-covered <cite>Connect the Sounds! Gunpey Reverse</a>) to the American market for both Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable for the holiday season this year.</p>

<p>Namco Bandai says the game was originally designed by the late <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=536">Gunpei Yokoi</a> and is being brought to modern portables by Q Entertainment, makers of <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=994">Meteos</a></cite>.  A quick perusal of Namco Bandai's press materials shows the game screenshots are identical to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2277">the ones we posted earlier</a>, so at this point it looks like the game's style won't be changed for an American release.</p>
