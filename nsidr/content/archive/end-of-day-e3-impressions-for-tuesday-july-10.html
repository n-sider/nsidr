With the conclusion of the Microsoft conference, we're wrapped for our first day in Santa Monica at the new E3.  It's been quite the different experience so far; here's what we're thinking so far.<br />
<br />
<b>Matt:</b> I've got a bit of a love-hate relationship with Santa Monica so far.  It's definitely nice here, and our jobs have become a lot easier with the smaller throngs of attendees.  What bothers me about it is that everything is so spread out.  Our schedule has us running all over the place, from hotel to hotel.  I miss the one-stop shopping from the LACC.    Time will tell, though, whether the additional opportunities from the smaller show will outweigh this particular negative.<br />
<br />
<b>Dean:</b> So far, Santa Monica has proven to be the best locale for our adventures yet. While it's yet to be seen if the whole idea of multiple hotels for meetings and gameplay will actually be benficial, the hospitality the E3 folk have shown us so far has been amazing.<br />
<br />
Nothing has been crowded yet, the Microsoft Event was pretty busy, but it was nothing compared to previous years. Tomorrow kicks off the big day with Nintendo and Sony's press conferences, and then the actual show.. I'm certain our feelings might change by the end of the day, but as of right now, Santa Monica is beautiful, and I'm glad we're here.<br />
<br />
<b>Brandon:</b> I kind of agree with both Matt and Dean on this!  On one hand Santa Monica is really much more pleasant and accomodating than Los Angeles proper ever was, but on the other hand there's the sprawl and the bus system to deal with.  The new format of the show only complicates the difficulty with jumping from place to place.<br />
<br />
We shall see, however, what we all think by the time we're ready to leave.  All I know is that for now I'm tired and it's been a really long day since waking up in Florida twenty-five hours ago!  Good night and we'll see you all tomorrow.
