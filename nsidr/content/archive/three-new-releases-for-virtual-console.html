It's a bit late in the day, sure, but we have three new releases for the Virtual Console that went live today at 9 a.m. Pacific.  They are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Excitebike</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Beyond Oasis</i> (Sega Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Splatterhouse</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
If any of the above titles interest you, by all means head on over to your Wii Shop Channel and spend away.
