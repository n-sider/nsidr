<p>A story appearing today in Yahoo! Japan's business section says Nintendo will be <a href="http://charge.biz.yahoo.co.jp/vip/news/kab/060901/060901_mbiz188.html">holding an event</a> September 14 where attendees will be able to get hands-on time with Nintendo's upcoming home console Wii as well as discuss the company's financials.</p>

<p>This news follows the news of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2383"> a similar European event</a> September 15 as well as <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2372">an American event</a> held September 14 in New York.    Speculation is that Nintendo will take the opportunity to finally reveal launch details for Wii, since the company has previously said it will reveal these details <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2276">in September</a>.</p>
