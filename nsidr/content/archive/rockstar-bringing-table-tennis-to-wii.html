Rockstar Games has announced today that it is bringing the mouthful title <i>Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis</i> to Wii.<br />
<br />
Previously an Xbox 360 exclusive and winner of Gamespot's "Best Sports Title" award at last year's E3 show, Rockstar says the port will utilize the Wii Remote, but does not say how&mdash;merely citing fan requests for a Wii version as their impetus for making the game.<br />
<br />
Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is slated to hit Wii this fall.  It is unlikely it will face the same ratings controversy as <i>Manhunt 2</i>.
