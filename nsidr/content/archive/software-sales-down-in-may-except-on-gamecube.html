<p>RBC Capital Markets analysts report that May U.S. console and handheld software sales were down 17.1 percent from the previous year. The analysts attribute the decrease to be a result of the lack of a similar high profile release such as Ataris <i>Enter the Matrix</i> in 2003. RBC compared sales in May, 2004 to May, 2003, and noted that PlayStation 2 software dollar sales were down 18.5 percent, Game Boy Advance was down 16.1 percent and Xbox was down 7.7 percent. GameCube software dollar sales were up 21.8 percent from one-year ago.</p> 

<p>PS2 software unit sales were down 11.7 percent year-over-year, Game Boy Advance sales fell 11.8 percent and Xbox was down 10.4 percent. GameCube software unit sales gained 36.0 percent from May, 2003.</p>
