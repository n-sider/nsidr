<p>Nintendo DS owners still playing <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a></cite> have an opportunity to take their systems into their local Toys "R" Us store and receive one of six rare Mario-themed items unavailable otherwise in the game via wireless download.</p>

<p>The items offered are the 1-up mushroom, star, fire bar, goal flag, question box and pipe.  Players need to purchase a note in a bottle, write a message, release it into their stream of ocean, set their game into Tag Mode, and bring it within range of the station at the store.  The game will inform the player they have recieved a message, which appears as another bottled note containing the Mario item.</p>

<p>The promotion runs from July 23 to July 29.  The items will only be offered for one week only, Nintendo says.</p>
