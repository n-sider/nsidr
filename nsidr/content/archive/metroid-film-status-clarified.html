<p>In the latest issue of Nintendo Dream magazine, according to GameSpot, original producer of the Metroid series <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=266">Yoshio Sakamoto</a> said that despite reports earlier in the year, a movie based on Metroid is not currently in the works. Director John Woo has merely gained the rights to negotiate with Nintendo to create a film based on the license.</p> 

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">"There were some misleading reports before the E3 that Metroids production was confirmed," said Yoshio Sakamoto.  "But to be accurate, its that the company that John Woo works for has gained the rights to negotiate with Nintendo of America to make Metroid into a movie. Metroids production hasnt been officially decided yet, and theres no release plans for it."
