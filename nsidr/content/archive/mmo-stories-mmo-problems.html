As you progress through <i>The Lord of the Rings: Online</i>&#8212;an MMORPG set in Tolkien's Middle Earth&#8212;you follow along just behind the Fellowship as they make their way to Mordor. At a certain point, you're to help Aragorn on a quest to protect the hobbits while they're hiding out at The Prancing Pony. It's an iconic moment in the book that they've managed to work into the game&#8212;certainly something to get excited about. You open the door to meet Aragorn in his room while you prepare yourself for a momentous encounter. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait in line with the other dozen heroes who are trying to complete the quest.<br />
<br />
(note: this story was shamefully stolen from Jeff Green)<br />
<br />
Situations like this are rather common in MMOs. In these somewhat persistent worlds you're faced with grand events that are supposed to be world-shaping and character-defining. These events are usually repeatable and other players can have the identical experience. In one's own little world, this is usually adequate. I can still remember the first time I downed Ragnaros in <i>World of Warcraft</i>, and there's a personal story associated with that, related to the people I did it with and how we managed to do it. Still, for being one of the most important events in the game (at the time, anyway), the impact of it didn't feel that great in relation to the rest of the world I was in.<br />
<br />
I wasn't particularily looking for glory, fame, or anything like that. I just felt it was a little weird being proclamed as a hero when I knew damn well that hundreds of other people on my very server had done the exact same thing. I didn't really feel like what I had done was <i>special</i>, so why try to obfuscate the issue by pretending that it was? If you look at any single player experience, the situation is certainly similar, but there's a key difference. In the game, you do perform some heroic deed and it's recognized as such by the characters and elements within the game. While other players around the world can experience the same thing, that instance of the game that you're playing is <i>shaped</i> by the very actions you take. In the massively multiplayer setting, this is rarely realized. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, due to the immense scope of these games, there's a <i>lot</i> of story content in them.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">something</div><br />
- discussion of storytelling in MMOs; essentially, what I think works and what I think doesn't (or at least, what I think is good and what isn't)<br />
<br />
- will reference time spent in WoW and all the wacky stuff I did and why it was so memorable (will try to keep it brief, so as not to be too hard for non-WoW players to understand)<br />
<br />
- will reference EVE Online (general how it handles story and specifically a couple of classic stories from the game), Age of Conan's single player stuff, WoW's phasing "technology" and BioWare's new KOTOR MMO<br />
<br />
- multiple users shaping the world; how should developers handle things like a dragon that is repeatedly killed<br />
- issues with being the reknowned hero with a million other reknowned heroes (AoC especially had this in its storyline)<br />
- mention machinima somewhere (brrrriiiiieeeefly .. really, who likes machinima?)<br />
<br />
- find some actual quest text <br />
- theories for improvement<br />
- mention that most people just want a single player game with a chatroom (there was a survey done on this)<br />
- EVE probably does the best job of what I would like to see, but it's very inaccessible<br />

http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/11/14/ -- throw that in somewhere<br />
<br />
If you've ever played an MMO and bothered to read the quest text, you may have noticed a few things:<br />
<br />
<ol>
  <li>There's a lot of it.</li>
  <li>Most of it's repetitive.</li>
  <li>You're probably not actually reading it.</li>
</ol>Generally, quest text seens to be thrown in to give some sort of purpose to the long list of menial tasks that you're asked to perform. After all, if you're going to be killing 40-odd pigs for various organs and other body parts, you better have a good reason for doing so, right? For the most part, I'd say it's just filler that most people don't bother with. People just want to get their quest done, get their reward and experience and move onto the next task. I wish I had some statistics on that, but if you'll take my word for it, I think we can assume it to be true. Still, if you're a little skeptical, here's some quest text to give you a better idea of what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
<div class="box">Game: World of Warcraft<br />
Title: Skullsplitter Tusks<br />
Task: Acquire 18 Skullsplitter Tusks and return them to Kebok.<br />
<br />
It's expensive and hard to kill enough tigers to support the export of tiger fangs to the islands in the South Seas. Luckily, we've developed a technique that allows us to take mundane horn-like objects and turn them into undetectable forgeries.<br />
<br />
The closest match we've found, amazingly, are the tusks of the Skullsplitter trolls.<br />
<br />
Hey, before you say anything, what the buyer doesn't know doesn't hurt them, am I right? Bring me a large number of them so we can get to work on the monthly shipment!</div><br />
this is a mid-low level quest (level 40)<br />
<br />
<div class="box">Game: World of Warcraft<br />
Title: Tuskin' Raiders<br />
Task: Prigmon needs you to collect 10 Forest Troll Tusks from the trolls in Zul'Aman. Bring them to him at Budd's camp in the Ghostlands. <br />
<br />
'Ey mon! You be new around 'ere, eh? Lemme ask a favor of ya.<br />
<br />
Budd's been refinin' his forest troll disguise. Says that he be close now - just be needin' one last touch. Tusks.<br />
<br />
My skinnin' talents be wasted 'ere. Somethin' about yankin' troll tusks be makin me queasy. <br />
<br />
Bring me back 10 troll tusks, eh mon?</div> (this is a level 70 quest)<br />
<br />
In other cases, the game may make pop culture references and even lead you on a bit of a storyline. Below is a series of connected quests.<br />
<br />
<div class="box">Game: World of Warcraft<br />
Title: Digging Through Bones<br />
Task: Escort Letoll and his crew and protect them while they make their dig. Return to Dwarfowitz at the Sha'tari Outpost if you succeed.<br />
<br />
Oy! You look like you can take care of yerself, &lt;race&rt;. Me and the crew here are looking for a bodyguard to watch over us while we hit a dig site to the north. The pay is pretty good and all you gotta do is make sure no nasty creatures kill me or any of my employees.<br />
<br />
If you successfully make it back without any casualties, Dwarfowitz over there will pay ya.</div>So, a group of diggers would like some protection. Once you escort them to the location, they handsomely repay you with money, experience and maybe some items. Better yet, they've got more work for you!<br />
<br />
<div class="box">How would you like to do a little more work for the Explorers' League? These bone worms have us all quite intrigued.<br />
<br />
I've got a drum right here that you can use out in the Bone Wastes. Just bang on the damned thing and see what you get. If it's a worm, kill it and bring back the carcass for us to study. We'll need a good lot of carcasses to get a valid testing sample.</div><br />

<div class="subheader">The Fourth Pillar</div>BioWare's new KOTOR MMO<br />

<br />
During a presentation at the unveiling of their new KOTOR MMO, BioWare highlighted what they believe to be the three basic gameplay pillars of current MMOs&#8212;combat, exploration and character progression. According to them, the missing fourth pillar is story. Given what I've discussed so far, I think you can see why that could be a popular opinion.<br />
<br />
What they plan to do is have a strong storyline for each character class.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">World of Warcraft War Stories</div><br />
I played Blizzard's <i>World of Warcraft</i> for roughly two years and really enjoyed it. Exploring the world, crafting new items, and running new dungeons made up a lot of the entertainment factor. That wasn't really enough to keep me going, though. It was the random PvP (player-vs-player) combat in the world that really made me want to play every night. I was also playing on a PvP server, which means that in the majority of areas, players of the two opposing faction&#8212;Horde and Alliance&#8212;can engage in combat at any time.<br />
<br />
The most memorable experiences in the game always involved those completely spontaneous moments when my friends and I  would get into fights with other players. Normally, this would happen while doing some other mundane activity like performing quests, harvesting resources, or leveling our characters&#8212;all things the game uses for normal progression. We'd break from whatever we were doing to go slaughter whoever was in the area. Rarely was there ever a tangible reward for this, but it was always fun and always generated some great stories.<br />
<br />
For instance, shortly before <i>The Burning Crusade</i>&#8212;the first expansion&#8212;came out, Blizzard conducted an in-game event where The Dark Portal&#8212;the primary gateway to the new expansion content&#8212;opened and monsters began flooding through. To entice players to the event, Blizzard implemented a quest for players to complete, with a reward that would not be accessible after the expansion was released. <br />
<br />
Naturally, there was a pretty big fight between the Horde and Alliance over this area for that time. With the help of some others, I organized a group of players to retake the Dark Portal. Forming a massive line, we all charged in and fought until we had claimed and secured the area. We spent the rest of the night fending off attacks and forming smaller groups to go out and disrupt any organized attempts to retake the territory.<br />
<br />
That night was probably the most fun I'd had in the game. While that may have been because of the unique nature of the event, I think it was predominantly because of how I had been playing the game up until that point. The game content provided by Blizzard was really just what I was doing in order to have a way to experience those random events of player interaction.
