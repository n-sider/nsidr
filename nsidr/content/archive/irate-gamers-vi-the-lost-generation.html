<H3>Irate Gamers VI: The Lost Generation.</h3>



<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/irate6.jpg" align="left"><p><i>Non nova sed nove.</i>  What does this mean? Well by the end of this

edition of Irate Gamers, youll know. This being my first dive into the world

of Irate Gamers, Im going to focus on the one thing we love to silently hate:

the younger generation of gamers.</p>



<p>Gamers of today, Generation Y and younger,

dont appreciate the challenges put in front of them. Ill take my cousins for

example. When they play the original Super Mario Bros. for the NES, they have

trouble getting past the third world. Sure they have help from their father,

who is amazing at SMB by the way, but they give up easily. My focus here is

with the current generation of games, Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros. Melee,

anything.<br>

<br>

Over the Christmas holidays (2001) I had most of my

extended family over for a few days, namely, my dad's brother's family, who

have two kids, aged 8 and 6. Every time they come over they play N64, as the

last time they were here that's what was available to them. Between last visit,

and that holiday visit I obviously got my GameCube. Now, there was no way in

hell I was going to let them play my cube for obvious reasons (little sticky

booger infested hands!). I had SSBM in there and I was going through the game

at a nice pace; but oh wait, the little buggers have to come and interrupt. So

they come down; and since they're as I said, 8 and 6, they are in love with

Pokmon and they can name <i>every single one of them!</i> So I'm battling it

out with some random enemy, and low and behold a PokeBall comes on screen. They

immediately yell Its a PokeBall get it! Get the PokeBall! so hoping it would

shut them up, I get the PokeBall, and throw it at my enemy; thus killing him

with it as well. They named the Pokmon that came out and they were convinced

that PokeBalls were the only way to kill your enemy (oh this pissed me off).</p>



<p>So I'm playing more games, and

whenever a PokeBall came on the screen, they would not shut up to get it. Get

the PokeBall its the only way you can win! Pick up the laser sword, its

strong! Oh, then they have the decency to tell me how to play the game.</p>



<p>I'm working my way through event

mode 37, to get Pichu I believe it was, and the damned kids would not let it

go; since (my luck) event mode 37 is 'superstar Pokmon' or whatever, they

wouldn't shut up about that; endless PokeBalls too. So the kids were constantly

spouting Get the PokeBall its the only way you can win! and since they're my

cousins I cant tell them to screw off or they'll tell on me and all that

family-clause stuff. So, I deliberately avoided PokeBalls at all cost. And

well, I won. That shut them up for all of 20 seconds, why? Oh I'll tell you.</p>



<p>Next comes the 15 minute melee,

with wire frames. So here comes the endless questions about 'Why are they all

purple?', 'Why aren't they attacking?', 'How many do you have to kill?', 'Why

arent you moving?'.</p>



<p>The next day started early,

damned kids... I went to bed at 2am the night before (watching Letterman); and

during the holidays I sleep till like 2 or 3 in the afternoon; get a nice 12-14

hours of sleep; but not today. They waited outside of my room from 8am until my

Mom eventually opened the door and let them wake me up at 10am. I told them to

go away; and my Mom proclaims 'they dont know how to turn on the Nintendo.'

Yes, its already hooked up, and no one in the house can read the infernal

machine and see the (different coloured!) button to turn the power on? So I

lose 4 hours of sleep to go downstairs and hit a white button. Not to mention

that, one of the kids was on this very computer that I'm writing on. I dont

trust <i>anyone</i> to use my computer; not even my family, and my mother let

them use it. I still haven't checked if anything is deleted (last time they

were here half my music was gone, and my mario64 saves were erased on my n64).</p>



<p>So I let them play SSBM all day,

I went out with some friends, I come back and immediately those little buggers

want to play. I said no, I'm gonna put the cube away. So I unhooked it and

put it where they couldn't reach it, and immediately the kids got even more

annoying (is that possible? YES!). So I left it unhooked for the rest of the

day, because I couldn't even play 1p mode without their guidance on how to

play my games.</p>



<p>Luckily for me, I had only

rented SSBM, even though I've beaten it completely (yes unlocked everything,

levels, characters, all that), I had to return it that night. The kids went to

bed and I brought the game back. So I went to sleep again, at about 2 am; the

next morning they wanted to play SSBM; but guess what? Its not there! I felt

evil, but alas, my pains werent over. So my mom some how, put Luigi's mansion

in; and they played that.</p>



<p>I figured there is nothing else besides a

vacuum, what could they possibly bug me about? Boy was I surprised. It was

almost their goal to annoy the hell out of me, to prove to me that I dont know

what Im doing. Upon booting up the game, Alex, the oldest, says that he played

this game at Wal-Mart or some store like that; so he proceeded to tell me how

to suck up ghosts (even though I had beaten the game twice before and was

working on my third time through.). <br>

<br>

I flipped. I turned off the system and left the house for a while. They

succeeded; they got to me and annoyed me to no end. As much as you may tell the

younger generation or even show them with physical proof, they try to prove to

you that they know better, that they know how to play the game more than you. <br>

<br>

Maybe its a form of envy, theyre trying to emulate the older generation. But

they have a lot to learn. Now that they are getting older, theyre getting a

bit better. But just as Jason described in his <a

href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=features/difficulty.htm">Difficulty

Decision</a> article, they do call on me to beat bosses in Mario Sunshine for

them. <br>

<br>

One difference? Instead of showing me how to play the games Ive already

conquered, Alex sits back and Watches the wiz (his words, not mine). <br></p>

<br>

Nintendos vision of gaming is still based on our generation (X); but it has the look and feel of the new generation (Y) 

so what happens is a crossing, the games look like something for the younger

generation, but play like something for the GenXers. See Mario Sunshine for

example, it looks great, but its no easy game (the boss is, but thats another

story). It gives us original gamers the challenge weve looked for. But it

gives us the headache of the Younglings badgering us to beat it for them. <br>

<br>

So I say, <i>Non nova sed nove</i>  Not new things, but in a new way. <br>

<br>

We, the Nintendo Generation, will be the ones making the games of the future.

Boy, are they (Generation Y and younger) in for a surprise.</span></p>
