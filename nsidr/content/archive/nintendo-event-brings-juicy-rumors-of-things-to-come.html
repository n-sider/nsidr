<p>Juicy, juicy.  Here's the word on the street -- the streets of New York to be specific.  Anthony JC updates us on information overheard during his Nintendo conference travels.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Earthbound Zero, Earthbound, Earthbound 2, Metroid 2 (color) are coming to the Virtual Console.<br><br>

<li>There will be new Virtual Console remakes of certain NES and Game Boy games by first and third party developers. Expect to pay a bit more upon release. Online Wi-Fi for Virtual Console games is still a mystery.<br><br>

<li>Pokemon Battle Revolution for Wii and Pokemon for Nintendo DS will arrive in North America sometime in March/April.<br><br>

<li>Arcade and Amiga 500 games will join the Virtual Console fold very soon.<br><br>

<li>Nintendo is contemplating releasing a Wii version of Tetris, Dr. Mario, and Mahjong exclusively through the Virtual Console. These are not ports of Famicom versions but new versions updated beyond their Nintendo DS counterparts.<br><br>

<li>Nintendo Wii owners will get to buy Virtual Console games, game soundtracks, wall papers, and other physical items (real life posters and toys for example) with Wii Points. Wii Points can be purchased, earned through buying games, donated from friends, and won through Wi-Fi raffles.
