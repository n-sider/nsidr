<p><ul>
<li>The epic story of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker continues as Link finds
himself lost and alone in unknown seas in a new adventure. Featuring intuitive touchscreen
controls and innovative puzzles, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass offers
new challenges for fans of the series and an easy-to-grasp introduction for gamers new to
The Legend of Zelda. But time grows short, and only the Phantom Hourglass can buy
Link the minutes he'll need to survive.
<li>The stylus makes controlling Link easier than ever. Tap on the screen to make
Link move, or sweep the stylus around him to swing the sword. Players can even
draw a path for his boomerang and send it flying into hard-to-reach targets.
<li>Players can stash the map on the top screen for quick reference or drop it to the
touch screen to make notes, study enemies, or chart a path for their boat to follow
while they man the cannons.
<li>Compete with a friend over a local wireless connection: Guide Link through
special dungeons to capture the Triforce, or command the forces that oppose him.
Game storyline: Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The
Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra's band of pirates have set sail in search of new
lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover
an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link
falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on
the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy's voice. With
the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra - and his way back to the seas he once knew.
Characters: Link, Tetra and a host of new characters native to the mysterious lands
where Link finds himself trapped.
<li>How to progress through the game: The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is
controlled almost entirely by the stylus. Using the touch screen, players direct Link's
movements and attacks: A sweeping motion triggers Link's spin attack and tapping
characters makes Link speak with them. The stylus controls offer a more intuitive means
of playing the game and open up new possibilities for puzzle solving.
The game action takes place primarily on the touch screen, with a map on the top screen.
However, the player can inspect the map on the touch screen and make notes using the
stylus. The notes on these maps are saved for review on the top screen during game play.
Players use the map to chart courses for their ships, too. Using the stylus to draw a path
through the islands, players set their ships' courses. Then, as the ships automatically
follow the paths drawn, players can control their ships' cannons to target oncoming
enemies.
<li>In dungeons, players can use the touch screen to draw paths for boomerangs, sending
them flying around corners or into otherwise unreachable areas.
Special powers/weapons/moves/features: The stylus-driven game play is the most
compelling new feature of The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. Players use the
stylus to control Link, chart courses for their ships, mark notes on maps and solve puzzles
in both the overworld and dungeons.
<li>A two-player wireless battle mode pits one player, as Link, against another player who
controls the enemies pursuing him. Link must collect enough Force Gems before the
enemies close in.
