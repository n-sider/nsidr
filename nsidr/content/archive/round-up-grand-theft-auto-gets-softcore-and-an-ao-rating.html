<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-06-27-nintendoground.jpg" align="right">As some of you should know by now, Take-Two and Rockstar have recently come under fire for an accessible mod (entitled "Hot Coffee") included within GTA: San Andreas in which players can engage in a minigame with a very sexual ending. If none of that rings any bells, well then read the full story <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/07/15/news_6129301.html">here</a>.  

<p>In any case, there have been several other interesting stories that have sprung out of this whole thing. The following are a few links I've gathered that may help shed some light on the various sides of this debate. Enjoy.
