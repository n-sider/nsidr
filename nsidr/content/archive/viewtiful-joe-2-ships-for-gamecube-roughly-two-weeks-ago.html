<p><i>Viewtiful Joe 2</i>, the successor to the critically acclaimed GCN sidescroller, <i>Viewtiful Joe</i> was released for the GameCube on November 17, 2004. The game will hit the PS2 on December 7th. <i>Joe 2</i> remains much like its predecessor, however, this time you are able to play as both Cynthia and Joe and swap characters on the fly. It was widely thought that the game would feature two-player cooperative play, but it turns out that it is still a single player venture.

<p>I apologize for not posting this sooner.
