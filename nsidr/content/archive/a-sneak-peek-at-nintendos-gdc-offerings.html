<br />
Playable titles for the Nintendo DS:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Spore: Creatures</li>
  <li>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</li>
  <li>Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword</li>
  </ul><br />
Playable titles for the Wii:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</li>
  <li>WiiFit</li>
  </ul><br />
There was also a rolling video of Mario Kart Wii, which showed 4-player split screen action and various different levels.  Nintendo's booth is relatively small, and all their meeting rooms are named after playable characters found in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (Samus, Meta Knight, etc).<br />
<br />
We'll have more GDC coverage as the week progresses.  Stay tuned.
