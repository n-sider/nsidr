<p>Two new pieces of Ubisoft-on-Wii information hit courtesy IGN today.</p>

<p>First, Ubisoft has increased their launch commitment, <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/731/731810p1.html">adding a Wii version</a> of <cite>Splinter Cell Double Agent</cite> for the launch window, which IGN says "likely means it'll arrive sometime in early or mid-November."</p>

<p>Second and perhaps most interestingly, Ubisoft, in conjunction with Thrustmaster, <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/731/731777p1.html">has created a steering wheel attachment</a> for the Wii Remote that will be bundled with <cite>GT Pro Series</cite> and <cite>Monster 4x4: World Circuit</cite>.</p>

<p>The wheel will not only work with both Ubisoft titles but because of its nature, should work with other games that use the Remote held sideways to steer, such as Nintendo's own <cite>Excite Truck</cite>.  GT Pro is set for release this holiday season.</p>
