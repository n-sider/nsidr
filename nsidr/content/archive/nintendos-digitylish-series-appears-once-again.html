<p><a href="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/695/695560p1.html">IGN</a> discovered that the ESRB-ratings website has the Digitylish series listed under a new name.  The series was first shown at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo.  Nintendo released a short <a href="http://www.nintendo-fi.com/product/misc/20050704171537.wmv">promotional video</a> showing the collection of simple, colorful, and stylized games. The titles shown in the video included Dialhex, Neopong, Dotliner, Digidrive and Coloris (these five titles were trademarked in early 2005 by Nintendo alongside the names Orbital, Sneakout, Sojourner, Swimworm and T-Typo).  At the show, Nintendo also used the series to showcase its then newly-announced Game Boy micro.</p>

<p>Info on the game series has since been silent.  Through the <a href="http://www.esrb.org/search_results.asp?key=digilux&x=0&y=0&type=game&validateSearch=1">ESRB-website</a>, it has been discovered that Nintendo has renamed the line of software to the "Digiluxe Series".  The series now includes six titles -- Boundish, Chromatron, Dotstream, Orbiter, Rotohex, and Sound Voyager.  Nintendo of America has not yet made any announcements concerning the games.  Keep a look out for that in the coming months.</p>
