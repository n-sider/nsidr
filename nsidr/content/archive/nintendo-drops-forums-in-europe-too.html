Nintendo of Europe has just announced the <a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/news/article.do?elementId=5OWvJBgv7nhltpYYUXq0HCjrUen3iiWh">shuttering</a> of their own official discussion forums, one week after Nintendo of America closed their own forums on the 17th.<br />
<br />
NOE cites that "a number of other online Nintendo communities have surfaced", with "people who are able to focus all their resources in one area" stepping up to meet the community need as their reasoning that their own forums are no longer needed.  Like NOA, they explain they're set to revamp their website.<br />
<br />
It seems reasonable to speculate that with regional Nintendo sites shutting down and revamping, a unified global Nintendo website might be in the cards.  Of course, no noise has been made to this effect, but it's clear there's a lot of shakeup going on at NOA and elsewhere&#8212;and where it will all go, only Iwata knows.
