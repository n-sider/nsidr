Hot on the preemptive heels of Square-Enix's upcoming media festival in Japan comes the announcement that fan favorite <i>Final Fantasy IV</i> is due for the DS treatment.<br />
<br />
Looking to be approached in much the same style as the enormously successful remake of <i>Final Fantasy III</i>, which was released for the DS last year, FFIV is sure to push the hardware as the recently revealed screens show.<br />

No official word on release dates or an English translation, but Square-Enix's Final Fantasy track record does not disappoint.  More information is sure to be revealed over the coming days as the media festival progresses.<br />
