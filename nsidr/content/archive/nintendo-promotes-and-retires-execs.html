Nintendo of America said Randy Peretzman, vice president of sales, will retire at the end of this year. After 20 years of dedicated service, Peretzman has decided to step down due to health reasons.  Peretzman will be replaced Kevan Wilson, an 11-year veteran of Nintendo.<br>
<br>
Peretzman joined Nintendo as the company's first regional sales manager in New York. His first project was the launch of the NES at a time when retailers had little interest in video games. After hand-carrying NES prototypes from one New York retailer to another, he effectively helped re-launch the video game industry into the $10 billion industry it is today. Peretzman relocated to the state of Washington in 1992 to take on the role of director of sales. In 1996, he was promoted to vice president of sales. In his current role, he has overall responsibility for the entire Nintendo of America sales department, including establishing the strategic direction and objectives for the division. Prior to joining Nintendo, Peretzman spent several years as a vice president at a consumer electronics firm. He began his career in New York retail, working his way up from buyer to VP general merchandise manager over the course of 15 years. A native of New York, he is a graduate of Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey.<br>

Wilson joined Nintendo of America as regional manager in August 2000 and was promoted to director in 2002, when he took on additional responsibility for the Chicago sales team. In 2004, he was promoted to his current role, senior director of sales. Prior to joining Nintendo of America, Wilson successfully managed the sales and merchandising operations at Nintendo of Canada for six years. Before that, he spent 15 years in the Canadian packaged goods industry, including Bristol-Myers and Unilever, in various sales, trade marketing and marketing management positions.
