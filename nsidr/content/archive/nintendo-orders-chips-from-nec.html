<p>German gaming news site GameFront passes the word along that in a Bloomberg interview, NEC president Toshio Nakajima has confirmed that NEC has recieved orders for chips used in Nintendo's upcoming home console, currently code-named Revolution.</p>

<p>Nakajima says delivery of the order will commence this fall with an eye toward a Christmas release for the console.  Nintendo will be spilling most, if not all, of the beans on Revolution at its E3 press conference, just two weeks away &mdash; with any luck, they'll be confirming the release plans at the same time.</p>
