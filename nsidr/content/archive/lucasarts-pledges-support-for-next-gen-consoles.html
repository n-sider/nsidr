<p>Boomtown.com recently interviewed LucasArts president Jim Ward.  He speaks about the company's intended support of the next-generation consoles.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
"We celebrate all new platforms, we will support all new platforms, and we will be on all platforms. When you watch a game, we will do it on all of them as best as we can. You can surely talk about all those pros and cons but to the degree that consumers buy a certain platform, we want to make sure that there is a LucasArts game for it."

<p>Questions posed to Ward also cover a wide range of topics including storytelling in games and his thoughts on the potential of online gaming.  Be sure to check out the full interview <a href="http://pc.boomtown.net/en_uk/articles/art.view.php?id=8387">here</a>.</p>
