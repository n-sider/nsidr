If you're a member of Japan's Club Nintendo and have at least 400 points under your belt, get ready for something... well, something.
<br>
<br>
In addition to an assortment of collectible calenders, Nintendo is giving away replicas of the upcoming Revolution controller. But don't get too excited -- this device will only influence the volume, power and channel of your TV set (sigh). Still, being the first on your block to have one is an exciting prospect. Just don't confuse the two when launch-time rolls around.

At this time there's no word on whether the offer will be available in North America. Surely that 3-year subscription to Nintendo Power is good for something...
