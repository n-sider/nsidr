<h3>Dark Arena</h3>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/darkarena01.jpg" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="right" width="205" height="150">Majesco is the proud publisher of the Game Boy Advance's first official FPS, <i>Dark Arena</i>. Using a <i>Doom</i>-like engine, the futuristic action FPS is set to turn heads when the game is released this fall in the US. <i>Dark Arena</i> promises to have an original and interesting storyline as well as original characters and levels to help distinguish itself from Activision's <i>Doom</i> for the GBA.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/darkarena02.jpg" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="left" width="210" height="150">Majesco promises the game will feature four-player support, with modes such as deathmatch, capture the flag, and assault. Unable to provide more details, Majesco hopes to fully answer our questions by E3, when a close-to-finished version graces the floor alongside Majesco's other GBA games. Majesco has definitely become one of the more interesting GBA publishers by securing the GBA's first 3D space shooter in <i>Iridion 3D</i> and the first 3D FPS in <i>Dark Arena</i>; definitely a company to keep your eye on.</p>
