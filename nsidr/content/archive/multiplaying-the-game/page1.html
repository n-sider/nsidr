<H3>Multiplaying the Game</H3>

<p><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/multiplaying1.jpg"></center>

<p>In its first year of existence, the GameCube has been host to some of the best games of any platform this generation. It currently boasts a library of exclusive and critically acclaimed titles that appeal to gamers of all spectrums. Ranging from games that can be enjoyed by all ages like Super Mario Sunshine and Pikmin, to the darker and more mature feel of Metroid Prime, Eternal Darkness, and Resident Evil, the GCNs library is very comparable to those of its competitors. However, while the system may be home to some of the best games currently on the market, it is what the GameCube isnt home to that disheartens some. 

<p>While games like Metroid Prime and Eternal Darkness have been honored by many publications as Game of the Year or having Best Story of the Year, there is no way that they could ever win an award for one categorybest multiplayer experience. This is because neither of these games feature any multiplayer modes of play. They arent alone either. The GameCube may be host to some of the best games this generation, but the majority of them are aimed at the solitary gamer. 

<p>This doesnt mean that single player games are, in any way, inferior to titles with multiplayer options. Historically, many of the best games are those played alone. On the other hand, the same could be said for games that emphasized multiplayer modes of play. A balance is required to satisfy the audience Nintendo has garnered over the years. 

<p>The Nintendo 64 era was a difficult time for Nintendo. The system was designed to be difficult to develop for, cartridges were expensive to manufacture, and Nintendo was still practicing methods that can only be described as laughable when dealing with third party developers. Publishers had to purchase cartridges in set amounts (100k, 200k, 1 million, etc) at pretty stiff prices. On top of that, Nintendo would receive a set percentage of revenue for each cartridge sold (somewhere around 10 percent I believe but dont hold me to it). So what happens if a publisher orders a million cartridges of a game and only 10,000 sell? Well, that company is stuck paying for the entire million. This policy worked back when Nintendo was on top, but times change and the company was slow in following. The result was a gaming system supported almost entirely by Nintendo. 

<p>The N64 became home to some of the best single player games ever including Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Nevertheless, it was really the introduction of many different and new forms of multiplayer titles that allowed Nintendo to stay afloat in a changing market. Mario Party, Super Smash Bros., Mario Tennis, Mario Golf, Mario Kart 64, Diddy Kong Racing, Aki-made wrestling games, Star Fox 64, Goldeneye 007, and Perfect Dark. Along with others, these titles changed the way many people thought about multiplayer gaming. The Nintendo 64 became the console to have for parties and get-togethers with friends. 

<p>Moving back to the present, the GameCube has been out over a year and a half, yet the majority of its exclusive releases include little or no multiplayer features at all. Metroid Prime, Star Fox Adventures, Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil, Super Mario Sunshine, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Pikmin, Star Wars Rogue Leader, Resident Evil 0, and Luigi's Mansion consist of the majority of major exclusive releases. Noticing any trends here? With the exception of a few great games like Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Monkey Ball, alone is how many games are played on the Cube. When it comes down to multiplayer mayhem, the GameCube library can't really hold its own when compared to offerings on the Xbox or PlayStation 2. 

<p>To add additional fuel to the fire, lets take a look at the numbers. The best selling title for the GameCube is Super Smash Bros. Melee. Super Monkey Ball also enjoyed fruitful sales at the launch of the console, as has Mario Party 4. Even Animal Crossing (a communication game) with its very Japanese-like game play has managed to garner sales of over 400,000 units in North America alone. The sales statistics speak for themselves. Many gamers purchase the GameCube with the hope that it will be the best console to have if friends come over. Hopefully after this year, it just might be. 

<p>Not only is the future bright for those who enjoy multiplayer action as well as one cube-shaped console, its spectacular. In the next year or so, there will be a dramatic increase in the number of top notch games from Nintendo and its many partners that take advantage of the, traditionally unused, second, third, and fourth controller ports. In fact, there are even some that push the realm of multiplayer gaming to a whole new level. From racing to fighting, wrestling, shooting, Action, strategy, and even role-playing; GameCube fans are in for a treat. 

<p>Racing fans are set for an overdose of Nintendo published software this year. Not only will they receive an update to the famous Mario Kart series, but the slick new F-Zero GX as well.

<p>Developed by EAD, Double Dash is looking better each month. The game will feature a new setup where each kart holds two racers (one driving and one in back manning the weapons) that can switch places at any time. In addition, the battle and versus modes from previous installments will return with added prestige; for Nintendo has announced that the game will be LAN (Local Area Network) combatable for up to eight players at a time (it is now rumored that 16 players may be able to play together). What does this mean? Simply put, gamers will be able to hook up to eight televisions (each with its respective GameCube) together for multiplayer matches. One of the benefits of this are that each player can have his or her own screen, simultaneously enhancing the fun of the match as well as add a slight layer of stealth, since it would be more difficult for other players to look at your screen. It is expected that gamers will also be able to hook up just two GameCubes to get the eight-player experience (two screens, each with four-player split screen). At recent showings the game has been running with faster Kart speeds (comparable to Mario Kart 64), so dont get all worked up if you heard anything bad about the game in that respect. Double Dash will have all the power slides, balloon popping battle modes, and special powerups gamers have come to expect of the series and will be a needed addition to the GameCube library.

<p>Then theres F-Zero GX. Developed by Segas Amusement Vision in conjunction with Nintendo, the game is almost definitely going to be one of the fastest and best futuristic racing game to date. Winning E3 (Electronics Entertainment Exposition) GameCube game of the show from several respected gaming publications, the title is everything fans of the series could possibly want in a sequel, and a bit more. GX features 30 different cars to choose from, a number of different single player modes, and a four-player split screen versus mode. With tight controls, a constant 60 fps (frames per second), customizable cars, a formula that stays true to the series, and (best of all) multiplayer racing under its belt, F-Zero GX is sure to be a worthwhile new incarnation of the series that invented futuristic racing.
