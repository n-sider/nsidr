<p>GamesIndustry.biz has been watching the sale of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> in Japan, and notes that they've moved 2,498,720 combined units since this year kicked off.</p>

<p>Of the nearly 2.5 million units, 1.635 million were the lighter, brighter Lite, which was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1819">introduced to long overnight lines at retail</a> in early March.  Since Nintendo was finally able to sate demand for the Lite somewhat in their native land, they've introduced the redesigned juggernaut in Australia (on June 1st) and will sell to North American consumers this coming Sunday.</p>
