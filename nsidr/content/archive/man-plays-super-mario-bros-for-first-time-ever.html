<P>Some Kotaku dude posted a link to this YouTube video of Japanese comedian Shigenori Yamashita playing Super Mario Bros. for the very first time ever.  Aside from the total hilarity, it's actually a very interesting case study on how even games lauded as being the most played and the most accessible ever are still just... a little confusing to the average Joe Sixpack.</P>
