<p>Nintendo of America has finally drip-fed us the last of the information about <i>Tetris DS</i> &mdash; namely, the last three game modes.  (We've <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1744">covered Standard, Touch, and Push</a> previously.)</p>

<p>Mission Mode's theme is <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=243"><i>The Legend of Zelda</i></a>.  Your modus operandi: complete missions (such as using a particular piece to clear two rows) within the time limit.  Just like any other puzzle game's mission mode.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=218"><i>Metroid</i></a> is the theme for Catch Mode, which has players catching falling pieces onto their glob of blocks to try to complete a 4x4 square, which explodes outward.</p>

<p>Finally, we've got the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=142"><i>Yoshi's Cookie</i></a>-themed Puzzle Mode.  200 puzzles live in this mode, and you're not timed for solving them, but you have to select the piece you want to use and its orientation from a small collection on the bottom screen with the eventual goal of clearing the entire puzzle.</p>

<p>March 20.  <i>Tetris DS</i>.  Be there.</p>
