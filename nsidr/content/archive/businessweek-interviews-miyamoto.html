<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/">BusinessWeek</a> has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958127.htm">interviewed</a>  EAD general manager <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, getting his thoughts on game design, graphics, the future of gaming, and the accessibility of games to a wide range of people.</p>

<p>Interestingly, he may even give a glimpse of some future Nintendo projects:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>In the future, what do you think video games will be like?</b></p>
<p>It's convenient to make games that are played on TVs. But I always wanted to have a custom-sized screen that wasn't the typical four-cornered cathode-ray-tube TV. I've always thought that games would eventually break free of the confines of a TV screen to fill an entire room. But I would rather not say anything more about that. </p></blockquote>
