The title arrives via publisher Nintendo of America and developer Nintendo Software Technology. More info can be found at the game's official <a href="http://www.mariovsdk.com/">website</a>.</p>

<p>In a twist from the original Mario vs. Donkey Kong where Mario was given the task of rescuing all the Mini Marios, in the sequel, it's left in the hands of the Minis to save Mario.  The game features a full one-player mode and also allows players to create their own maps with a new level editor and share it with friends over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Mario vs Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis currently has an 84 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/932770.asp">GameRankings.com</a> (based on 4 reviews).</p><br>

"Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 may not play quite the same way the original game did, but the new take on the formula is a fun and refreshing one. The touch-screen controls are easy to get a handle on, and with more than 80 different stages to play through, as well as the construction mode, you'll find yourself with plenty to do."

"As a sequel, Mario vs. Donkey Kong: March of the Minis surpasses the original by leaps and bounds backed by the capabilities of the Nintendo DS, however the new control scheme does take some getting used to. Although, graphically it's no New Super Mario Bros., this 2D platformer makes full use of the dual screens; in-game and during the cut scenes. For audio enthusiast, March of the Minis is filled with cute little touches, such as Mario calling you names if you put the DS in suspend, that make the game shine. Well paced, new puzzle elements keep the game fresh and hip until the end."

"I'm also in love with the Construction Zone, a level editor that lets you create your own puzzles and share them with friends, either through ad hoc or the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection. This is really the true meat of the game because the possibilities are endless. People are going to get to work creating puzzles, upload them online, and you'll (hopefully) have hundreds of boards to master. But I encourage you to create some of your own. The program is really easy to use, and you'll unlock new construction sets/parts as you complete the Main Game."
