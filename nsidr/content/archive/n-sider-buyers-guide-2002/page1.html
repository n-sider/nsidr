<H3>N-Sider Buyer's Guide 2002</H3>



<P>With the furious buying season upon us, here at N-Sider we've decided that you might need some guidance, and it's with this that we invite you to our inaugural Buyer's Guide, conveniently titled Buyer's Guide 2002.



<P>We all know how hard it is to choose something for someone, and when it comes to Videogames, gameplayers can be as discerning as the worst of them.  Choosing the wrong product will have you receiving dirty looks or half-hearted thank-yous from your loved ones, or have you removed from the "Christmas Card list"!!!  And you wouldn't want that would you?  



<P>Well neither do we, so whether you (or your loved ones) are from America, Canada, the wonderful land down under, or from the vast reaches of Europe, you'll find plenty of advice catered specifically to each destination.  Advice that will bring shrieks of joy to confused shoppers, and ultimately will result in you getting that warm fuzzy feeling inside knowing that the person you're buying for receives something that will make anyone happy!



<P>As a teaser for some of the things we'll be talking about, here's a quick list of some of the big things to buy (and included in our guide): <I> Metroid Prime, Time Splitters 2, Metroid Fusion, Eternal Darkness, Super Mario Sunshine, GBA-GCN Link Cable, GBA Four-player link cable, Resident Evil Zero, Star Fox Adventures, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4,</i> and <b>many many more</b> to come.  You'll need to visit the territory to get the full coverage.


<P>We'll be recommending a lot of different choices, for different markets, so use the links on the right to find the territory most appropriate to you and/or the ones that you're buying for.  You won't be disappointed.  Choice is a great thing, and it's what we give you.  Go ahead and make a choice.
