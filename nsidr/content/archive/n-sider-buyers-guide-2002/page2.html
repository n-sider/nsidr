<h3>Buyer's Guide 2002 - North America (NTSC)</h3>



<p>Obviously, the biggest buzz this North American holiday season comes from <i>Metroid 

Prime</i>, which has virtually the entire video gaming community talking. But is it 

really for you? And what about third-party offerings such as <i>Resident Evil</i> and 

<i>Phantasy Star Online</i>? Fear not, intrepid shopper; N-Sider has got you covered.

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgmp.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgmp">Metroid 

  Prime</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it: </b>Fans of videogames in general. Honestly, even if 

  you're turned off by the FPS genre, you owe it to yourself to investigate <i>Metroid 

  Prime</i>; the innovative and incredibly in-depth scanning function and emphasis 

  on exploration and puzzle-solving as well as battling enemies gives the 3D update 

  of the old classics near-universal appeal. A brilliant game. There is nothing 

  like it. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> Those who want <i>Metroid Prime</i> to be a 100% mindless 

  FPS should steer clear. Otherwise, there's not too many who can't appreciate 

  this game on some level. This game may be a little hard to follow for younger 

  gamers. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It - This game alone is reason enough to own 

  a GameCube.<hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bged.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bged">Eternal 

  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a></i> </b>- GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Those who have are open to a new gaming experience 

  and not prone to judge a game without truly giving it a chance would like <i>Eternal 

  Darkness</i>. With an excellent and engaging storyline, top-notch control, a noteworthy 

  sense of pace, and a truly unique atmosphere, ED is perfect for those looking 

  for a game that plays the player. 

<p>The game's unique mix of action, puzzles and impressive plot make it a "must 

  own" title for those wishing for a deeper gaming experience. A truly enriching 

  experience and very much unique, <i>Eternal Darkness</i> is a rewarding experience 

  for those interested in a mature survival adventure game. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> <i>Eternal Darkness</i> is a very polished experience. 

  It is definitely not for those who do not enjoy thought provoking games or those 

  that don't like to invest much time into a title. However, don't dismiss this 

  game if you dislike other titles like <i>Resident Evil</i>; it is a far different experience. 

  Ultimately, most gamers would enjoy <i>Eternal Darkness</i> if they gave it a chance. 

  Only those who dislike any form of linearity or have very specific tastes may 

  be turned off by it. 

<p><b>Overall consensus:</b> Buy It - <i>Eternal Darkness</i> is one of the most compelling 

  games for the GameCube or any console, for that matter. <hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgmf.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgmf">Metroid 

  Fusion (Metroid IV)</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Those who would find most enjoyment from Fusion would 

  be fans of the previous <i>Metroid</i> games. Fans of <i>Super Metroid</i> will feel very 

  comfortable with Fusion. Anyone who likes a good adventure with a somewhat linear 

  feel and dramatic atmosphere will find that <i>Metroid Fusion</i> can do no wrong. 

 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> For every great game there are those who just 

  won't find it appealing. Gamers that don't find 2D side scrolling, exploration, 

  or intense blasting action should not even consider purchasing, renting, or 

  looking at <i>Metroid Fusion</i>. Fans of previous installments that consider themselves 

  weary of a slightly more linear and story driven experience coupled with the 

  very intense and downright fear of being hunted by an overwhelming adversary, 

  should steer clear. Lastly anyone who isn't fond of puzzle and strategic challenges 

  should probably pass as well. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It - A definite must have and one of the best 

  GBA titles to date. <hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgts2.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bgts2">Time 

  Splitters 2</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> <i>Goldeneye</i> and <i>Perfect Dark</i> fans should be eating, 

  sleeping, and breathing <i>Time Splitters 2</i>. Those who still enjoy a massively 

  frantic multiplayer battle royal with up to three friends will not be complete 

  without it. Not to discredit the game's single player modes though, since those 

  searching for a rewarding first person shooter will feel right at home as well. 

  It's a great single and multiplayer game, and such a comprehensive feature packed 

  package, that it would be a shame not to have this in a software collection. 

  

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Anyone who doesn't like first-person shooters 

  will find no love here. Since this game's most memorable attributes are in its 

  multiplayer aspect, gamers that won't get many opportunities to play against 

  others would, most likely, feel more fulfilled if they looked elsewhere. And 

  finally, those who get motion sickness and/or epileptic seizures from any first-person 

  shooter should opt to pass this one up. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It - It's worth playing, and extremely difficult 

  to ignore if you have human rivals ready for a little fragfest. <hr>



<p><b><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgsfa.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgsfa">Star 

  Fox Adventures</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Those who are entertained by large amounts of item 

  collecting and believe that the prospect of a <i>Star Fox</i> game having control and 

  design near identical to that of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> could 

  find themselves right at home with SFA. The game will also appeal to those unbothered 

  by the titles lack of character when it comes to the <i>Star Fox</i> presentation of 

  the title.

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> Anyone expecting a tight knit and true sequel 

  to <i>Star Fox 64</i> will not find it here. Anyone looking for a truly memorable gameplay 

  experience and epic storyline, equal to or greater than Nintendo's own <i>Legend 

  of Zelda</i> series, will not find it here. 

<p>Basically if you don't enjoy collecting things, are bothered by a large amount 

  of cut scenes, did not like the control style of <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina 

  of Time</i>, or will only accept a storyline heavily involving other <i>Star Fox</i> staples 

  then it is highly suggested that you steer clear.

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It - It is a decent adventure game for those 

  willing to put aside its presentation issues.<hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgsmc.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bgsmc">Sonic 

  Mega Collection</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Those who can't get enough of the classic <i>Sonic the 

  Hedgehog</i> games will love this compilation. The game features seven classic Sonic 

  games including <i>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</i> and <i>Sonic & Knuckles</i>. All ported to 

  near perfection. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>There is a growing list of people who may not 

  enjoy these collections of games. Those who played most of the games back in 

  the Genesis era will find little reason to purchase them again. Those who purchased 

  a similar package for the Dreamcast or other previous Sega consoles may not 

  be akin to spending more cash. Finally those who just never enjoyed 2D sonic 

  games may not find much enjoyment out of these seven titles. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus:</b> Skip it - Unless you have never experienced these 

  before it becomes very obvious that Sega could have included a few more extras.<hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgmohf.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgmohf">Medal of 

  Honor Frontline</a></i> </b>- GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Anyone who loved <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> the movie or 

  previous <i>Medal of Honor</i> titles for PC and Playstation. The presentation in <i>Medal 

  of Honor: Frontline</i> is top notch, and players will certainly feel like they've 

  stepped foot on the battlefield from the very first level. 

<p>This is the first time a <i>Medal of Honor</i> game has appeared on a Nintendo console 

  and the amount of gameplay in the single and multiplayer game has been done 

  very well. In a <i>Metroid Prime</i>, <i>James Bond</i>, and <i>Time Splitters 2</i> world, <i>Medal of Honor: Frontline</i> still manages to be a FPS worth experiencing one way or 

  another. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> Obviously people who don't like first person shooters 

  wouldn't enjoy this game. One of the major problems with the GameCube version 

  of <i>Medal of Honor: Frontline</i> is controls that are very difficult to grasp. 

<p>Changing the controls from sharpshooter to the classic control style helps 

  out some, but even when you get to the point where you feel like you might have 

  the controls down, it's still sometimes hard to aim at who you're shooting at. 

  For those who have decent PCs and prefer a keyboard and mouse setup, it's probably 

  best to go with the PC version. 

<p><b>Overall consensus:</b> Buy It. <hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgmaddennfl2k3.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bgnfl&madden2k3">NFL 

  2K3 and Madden NFL 2003</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Any football fan would love either of these games. 

  You really can't go wrong no matter which you purchase. <i>Madden 2003</i> is a bit 

  more polished with more options and just a tad bit more fun to play. If you 

  had a Dreamcast and you're looking for a change of pace, <i>Madden 2003</i> is the 

  obvious choice. 

<p>However, if you missed the Dreamcast era and have missed playing the Sega Sports 

  titles from the Genesis days, you might be a little bit surprised at <i>NFL 2K3</i>. 

  It's definitely a solid title, but not quite as deep as Madden. If you're looking 

  for a good football title to play with friends, <i>NFL 2K3</i> might be a better choice 

  but in the end they're both good games. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Anybody who hates these types of games won't find 

  anything worth playing in either of these two games. If you're a fan of Football, 

  you can't go wrong with either. 

<p><b>Overall consensus:</b> Buy It - (<i>Madden 2003</i> preferred over <i>NFL 2K3</i> if it 

  came down to it.) <hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgyisma3.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgyisma3">Yoshi's 

  Island: Super Mario Advance 3</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance 

<p><b>Who would like it: </b>A remake of the classic SNES title of the same name, 

  <i>Yoshi's Island</i> is a game that young and adult fans alike will enjoy. The game 

  is a bit more linear in structure when compared to its predecessor (<i>Super Mario 

  World</i>), but it still offers an experience unmatched by almost all platformers. 

  The last of the 2D Mario titles, <i>Yoshi's Island</i> is a lesson in familiarity and 

  simplicity that few other games can come close to matching.

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>There are few out there that shouldn't enjoy <i>Yoshi's 

  Island</i>. The only individuals that may have a problem with it would be those 

  that truly abhor 2D platformers or those that find the game to have a bit too 

  childish theme for their tastes. However, turning a game down based on its graphical 

  style alone is ignorant and we are sure no one would ever do that. Right?

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It. <hr>

  

<p><b><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgsms.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bgsms">Super 

  Mario Sunshine</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Anyone who is even remotely attracted to platformers 

  should be quite taken with <i>Mario Sunshine</i>. The addition of Mario's waterpack 

  is far more than just a gimmick, as it adds legitimately new gameplay possibilities 

  and directions to the genre; for those concerned that <i>Mario Sunshine</i> is simply 

  more of the same, your fears should be quelled by this. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Much like <i>Resident Evil</i>, Mario sticks to its tried-and-true 

  formula established in <i>Super Mario 64</i> in spite of a new addition. It's different 

  enough to be a fresh experience, even after playing <i>Super Mario 64</i>, but it doesn't 

  have justification for those not fond of the platforming genre to make a purchase. 

  Still, for the majority, <i>Mario Sunshine</i> should make a wonderful holiday gift. 

 

<p>However, people expecting a <b>completely</b> classic Mario experience might 

  not enjoy it as much as Mario titles in the past. One of our staff thought it 

  was a little bit off base from past Mario platformers and the radical change 

  of the game was a bit of a turnoff. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It. <hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgre.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgre">Resident 

  Evil</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> If you're a previous fan of the <i>Resident Evil</i> games, 

  you're obviously going to be a fan of the remake. Even those who owned the original 

  on their PSX should investigate the GameCube version, as enough has been added/changed 

  to make the gameplay experience significantly different. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> This is still classic <i>Resident Evil</i>, so those 

  who never liked the series won't have any reason to be drawn in now. In addition, 

  if you've never played a <i>Resident Evil</i> game before, you may want to give this 

  one a rent to make sure you can get comfortable with the controls; there are 

  some who simply cannot deal with them. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus:</b> Rent It First. <hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgre0.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bgre0">Resident 

  Evil 0</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> See above. Like any other <i>Resident Evil</i> games? You're 

  going to like 0. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> Again, see above. RE0 may feature a new "partner-zapping" 

  system that allows you to switch control between two characters, but aside from 

  that, it doesn't offer up anything new for those harboring a dislike for the 

  series. It is also worth noting that the controls have not been changed for 

  RE0; in fact, Control Type "C" from the GameCube <i>Resident Evil</i> remake 

  -- widely regarded to be the best control option -- is not included in RE0. 

 

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It First. <hr>

 

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgjedioutcast.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgjo">Star 

  Wars Jedi Knights II: Jedi Outcast</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it: </b>Fans of <i>Star Wars</i> will be very accepting of <i>Jedi 

  Outcast</i>. The game utilizes the <i>Quake III</i> engine to its fullest extent and brings 

  the first acceptable lightsaber combat system to a <i>Star Wars</i> videogame. Basically 

  the direction you move while pressing the attack key determines what lightsaber 

  move you perform. Difficult to explain, but relatively easy to pickup; the combat 

  system is very needed to keep the game from feeling too much like its <i>Quake</I> 

  predecessors. Those who enjoy a long and (at times) tedious single player story 

  mode should find <i>Jedi Outcast</i> right up their alley. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Gamers that had a chance to indulge themselves 

  in the PC version of <i>Jedi Outcast</i> (released this past spring) will find the 

  GameCube version to be lackluster in comparison. The entertaining online multiplayer 

  modes are gone entirely; replaced by a split screen 4-player mode. The 4-player 

  mode is great but pales in comparison to the fun of online multiplayer with 

  this type of game. 

<p>Gamers expecting lightsaber action right off the bat will also be disappointed. 

  Players will not even receive their lightsaber until the later half of the gamefar 

  beyond where most players will call it quits. Those hoping for great variety 

  in gameplay will also come away disappointed as <i>Jedi Outcast</i> has little. Things 

  tend to get very tedious at times. 

<p><b>Overall consensus:</b> Rent or Avoid It.<hr>

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/powergrip100.jpg" align=right height=100 width=100><i><a name="bgpg">GBA 

  Power Grip Battery Pack</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Those who spend far too much cash on batteries for 

  their GBA should definitely check this device out. It not only provides about 

  10-15 hours of gaming before needing a recharge but also comes with an AC adapter.</p>

<p>For those that find the GBA rather small, the Power Grip is also a nice remedy. 

  The Power Grip adds two large <i>Mickey Mouse</i> ear-like handgrips to the bottom 

  of the GBA. The device may feel uncomfortable at first because it changes the 

  way one holds the Game Boy Advance. However, after a little while many will 

  begin to like the additional space for their hands and began to use the device 

  regularly.

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Those who enjoy using regular batteries may want 

  to skip this one. Also, those who have smaller hands shouldn't even consider 

  purchasing the Mad Catz Power Grip.

<p><b>Overall Consensus:</b> A worthwhile purchase. While not perfect, the savings 

  on batteries and the added AC adapter make the Power Grip a good buy. For those 

  who find the GBA to be too small this is a must have.<hr>



<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgwavebird.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgwb">Wavebird 

  Wireless Controller</a></i> </b>- GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it: </b>If you're intrigued by the idea of being freed from 

  the shackles of corded controllers, the Wavebird is for you. Able to operate 

  at ranges no normal gamer would ever play at (upwards of 40 feet), and sustaining 

  battery life admirably (estimates range between 50 and 100 consecutive hours 

  of play time), the Wavebird is the standard that all future wireless controllers 

  will be measured against. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> Players who simply cannot live without the "rumble" 

  function will want to steer clear of the Wavebird. Otherwise, it's a must-have. 

  

<p><b>Overall Consensus:</b> Buy It - A definite must have.<hr>



<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgac.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bgac">Animal 

  Crossing</a></i> </b>- GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it: </b>If you're looking for a fresh gameplay experience, 

  you can't do much better than <i>Animal Crossing</i>. Though fans of "life-simulation" 

  games such as <i>The Sims</i> may be a bit more at home here, the truth is that <i>Animal 

  Crossing's</i> appeal extends well beyond that genre. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> <i>Animal Crossing</i> demands constant (daily) input 

  from the player, but at the same time, it's not a game meant to be played for 

  hours at a stretch. In addition, there is no ultimate objective to the game; 

  while this may appeal to some, others may find the lack of a true goal frustrating. 

  Goodies such as tradable items and unlockable NES games may be enough to redeem 

  <i>Animal Crossing</i> in the eyes of those who traditionally would've steered clear, 

  however. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent it first and then buy it. Or buy it first and 

  then rent it. Either way you should end up buying it.<hr>

  

<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgsmb2.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgsmb2">Super 

  Monkey Ball 2</a></i> </b>- GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it:</b> Those who enjoyed the original <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> 

  will find its sequel to be nothing short of superb. SMB 2 features an expanded 

  single-player campaign, even more mini games, and a story mode. While the story 

  mode is corny at best, it does a nice job of setting the gamer up for more monkey 

  action. 

<p>Fans of other party games such as the <i>Mario Party</i> series should also give <i>Super 

  Monkey Ball 2</i> a try. Monkey Bowling, Monkey Baseball, Monkey Billiards, Monkey 

  Racing, Monkey Boxing, Monkey Target, and many more mini games provide the backdrop 

  for serious multiplayer action. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it:</b> Obviously, those who don't have a group of friends 

  to come and join the frenzy should avoid SMB 2. The only other viable reason 

  for letting this title slip through your fingers would be if you don't enjoy 

  party or multiplayer games in general. Even though it has an expanded single 

  player campaign, the game will not satisfy most on single player modes alone. 



<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It - Although definitely a welcome addition 

  to most game libraries, it is more of an event and party type of game.<hr>



<p><b><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgth4.jpg" align=right><i><a name="bgthps4">Tony 

  Hawk's Pro Skater 4</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it: </b>Fans of the Tony Hawk's games will feel right at 

  home with this latest edition. Those who found the time limits of previous installments 

  constraining will also feel much more at home with Pro Skater 4. Multiple combo's, 

  massive objective based levels, no time limits, quite a few mini games, and 

  new game modes unite to make <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</i> the best game yet in the 

  series, and one of the best extreme sports games available for any system. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Those who didn't enjoy previous games in the series 

  will not find happiness with Pro Skater 4. The game does not revolutionize the 

  series in any way so those discontented with the lack of innovation in previous 

  installments should also avoid <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</i>. Basically if you don't 

  take pleasure in remembering and executing (sometimes) long and complicated 

  button combinations in diminutive lengths of time to score varying amounts points 

  then it might be wise to rent this one first. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus:</b> Buy It - Those hoping for a fresh feel for the series 

  will find it herethose hoping for drastic changes should look elsewhere. 

  <hr>



<p><b><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgpso.jpg" align=left><i><a name="bgpso">Phantasy 

  Star Online: Episodes I & II</a></i></b> - GameCube 

<p><b>Who would like it: </b>Anyone desiring to go online with his or her GCN 

  should immediately pick this title up, as it is the only online-ready title 

  to be released for the console so far. The online-capability is not simply an 

  added bonus, but rather the meat of the game; although PSO is a fun single-player 

  quest, it is clear that the most enjoyment can be derived from questing with 

  others online. 

<p><b>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Those without online access or no desire to play 

  console games online should not purchase <i>Phantasy Star Online</i>. The single-player 

  mode, while good, simply is not justification enough for the game, as it is 

  largely standard RPG fare. If you're an RPG nut without internet access, you 

  may want to consider a rental, but otherwise, steer clear. 

<p><b>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy it if you have a viable connection to the Internet 

  and access to the necessary peripherals. Avoid it otherwise.<hr>



<p>What we've covered is just a taste of what games are available for Nintendo 

  consoles this Christmas. Shoppers who are just now purchasing a GameCube as 

  a gift to someone else may want to look at our PAL Coverage of our guide as they may feature some of the titles that were released in North 

  America some time ago.

<p>If you're still confused, you may want to consider something like a Blockbuster 

  gift card and a gift card to another store like Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart, 

  Toys R Us, etc. to let your gift recipient rent games with your first gift card 

  and then use your second gift card to ultimately buy a game of their choosing. 



<p>See you next year, right here in the land of the free.
