<H3>Buyer's Guide 2002 - Australia and Europe (PAL)</H3>



2002 was the year in which Nintendo finally gave us GameCube, and in the land 

down under, where the athletes are the greatest; and in the charming continent of Europe, where the tourists like to visit, we now have an enormously great selection of games to choose from. 



<p>GameCube has been out for over six months, Gameboy Advance has enjoyed more 

  than a year in the spotlight. And it's time for Nintendo to shine ever so brightly. 

  Here are our top picks guaranteed to bring joy to whoever receives it/them...

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgmf.jpg" align=right><B><I><a name="bgmf">Metroid 

  Fusion (Metroid IV)</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>The ones who would find most enjoyment from <I>Fusion</i> would be fans of the previous <I>Metroid</i> games.  Anyone who loved <I>Super Metroid</i> will feel right at home with <I>Fusion.</i>  The game provides an experience that will delight all <I>Metroid</i> fans, and should serve to introduce a new generation of players into the world of <I>Metroid.</i>  Anyone who likes a good adventure and shooting things will enjoy <I>Metroid Fusion.</i>



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Hopefully nobody, as this game is the best on Gameboy Advance for a long, long time.  People who generally don't like exploration should probably avoid.  <i>Metroid</i>-haters should give it a miss too.  And anyone who doesn't like a good puzzle and strategic challenge should probably pass as well.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgts2.jpg" align=left><B><I><a name="bgts2">Time 

  Splitters 2</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b><I>Goldeneye and Perfect Dark</i> fans would eat, sleep, and breathe <I>Time Splitters 2.</i>  People who like a great multiplayer battle-o-rama should lap this up too, and anybody who likes a quality first-person shooter should put <I>Time Splitters 2</i> at the top of the list.  It's a great single and multiplayer game, and such a comprehensive feature packed  package, that it would be a shame not to have this in a software collection.  Extremely difficult to ignore if you've got lots of opponents handy.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Anyone who doesn't get into first-person shooters should avoid.  People who won't get many, if any, opportunities to play against others should also probably go for something else with a little more single-player meat.  And finally, those who get motion sickness with any first-person shooter should pass as well.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgwavebird.jpg" align=right><I><B><a name="bgwb">WaveBird 

  Wireless Controller</a></b></i> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Anyone who is frustrated with controller cables, that's who.  The WaveBird is simply the best solution for this problem -- and that alone makes it well worth the expense in my opinion.  When you add the fact that you can play from a great distance (once again, with no threat of someone tripping over a cable) and that the battery life is very long, you have even more reason to pick up this revolutionary hardware.

 

<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>If you can't afford the cost of batteries (even though a four pack of AA batteries could potentially last for months on end), this is going to be a concern.  Also, if you are really attached to your controller's rumble feature, you might be dissappointed to know that the WaveBird does not posess such a feature (this keeps the price down and ensures longer battery life).  

 

<P>In addition, you might find the slightly added cost to be a deterrant. Other than those three negatives, there is really no reason not to own this controller.

 

<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Buy it.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bged.jpg" align=left><B><I><a name="bged">Eternal 

  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>If youre a fan of survival horror and/or adventure, youre going to love <I>Eternal Darkness.</i>  This game was only just released here in Australia and if you enjoyed <I>Resident Evil, </i>you will definitely find <I>Eternal Darkness</i> worthwhile.



<P>The games unique mix of action, puzzles and impressive plot make it a must own title for those of us who want a slightly deeper GameCube experience.  Generally speaking, I would not say that this game is as difficult as <I>Resident Evil.</i>  But with its increased focus on combat and magic, I believe it to be a slightly more rewarding experience.



<P><B>Who wouldnt like it: </b><I>Eternal Darkness</i> is a very complete package.  If youre the kind of person who doesnt like to invest much time or thought into games, <I>Eternal Darkness</i> may not be for you.  But dont dismiss this game if you dislike <I>Resident Evil;</i> its different enough to warrant your attention.  Ultimately, I think most gamers will enjoy <I>Eternal Darkness,</i> but if you are strictly an arcade gaming fan or if you have very specific tastes, it may not float your boat.



<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Buy it.

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/memcard251.jpg" align=right height=150 width=119><I><B><a name="bgmc251">Memory 

  Card 251</a></b></i> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Anyone who is running out of save slots on their memory cards will find salvation with the <I>Memory Card 251.</i>  After buying a new game, it's a major pain to have to fiddle around deleting gamesaves just to make room for the new game.  Or even worse, having to sit around <b>NOT</b> playing the game waiting for a new memory card!



<P>This kind of frustration would be a thing of the past, or at least a frustration that will come around once in a blue moon!  It's a god-send, particularly when some of the new games take up an entire 59 blocks of the original <i>Memory Card 59.</i>



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Nobody!  Everyone would like more save space!  And the only ones who wouldn't have a need for a bigger memory card would be the people who don't have many games, or the ones who will happily delete gamesaves to make room for new games.

 

<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Buy it.

<HR>

<P><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgsms.jpg" align=left><B><I><a name="bgsms">Super 

  Mario Sunshine</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b><I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> has very broad appeal.  This is a game that truly crosses the generation gap whilst also managing to include a wide variety of challenges for the experienced and the not-so-experienced.



<P>If youre a fan of platformers, this is definitely a no-brainer.  You must own this game.  And if youre not a fan of platformers, then you should still seriously look into a purchase.  <I>Super Mario Sunshine</i> manages to remain refreshingly interesting and should not be dismissed by any GameCube owner.



<P><B>Who wouldnt like it: </b>If you hate the genre in general, then you probably wont like <I>Super Mario Sunshine. </i> And if youre not a fan of the games bright colour palette, you might not be able to stomach the visuals enough to actually get some valuable play time in.  But generally speaking, even if you dislike the games style, I strongly recommend that you consider it.  There are few gamers who wont find something to enjoy in <I>Super Mario Sunshine.</i>



<P><b>Overall consensus:</b> Buy it. 

<HR>



<P><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgsfa.jpg" align=right><B><I><a name="bgsfa">Star 

  Fox Adventures</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>As <I>Star Fox Adventures</i> was created with a heavy dose of inspiration from the <i>Zelda</i> games, it's no surprise that <i>Zelda</i> fans should enjoy this too.  <I>Star Fox Adventures</i> is first and foremost an Adventure game, so all who love a good adventure would do well to pick this one up.



<P>Packed with puzzles and challenges, various areas to explore, enemies to battle, and innocents to protect, <I>SFA</i> is crammed with hours of gameplay to offer.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Anti-<I>Zelda</i> and anti-adventure players should avoid, obviously.  <I>StarFox Adventures</i> is a very big and very long game, so if you don't have the patience to stick with it, and prefer less demanding gameplay, this one isn't for you.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It.

<HR>

<P><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgth4.jpg" align=left><B><I><a name="bgthps4">Tony 

  Hawk's Pro Skater 4</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Fans of the <i>Tony Hawk's</i> games will feel right at home with this latest edition.  Previous players who didn't like the time limits will find welcome changes in this fourth instalment, and players new to the <i>Hawk's</i> franchise will start with the best.



<P>Multiple combo's, new moves and tricks, objective based levels, no time limits, massive arenas, and new game modes combine to make <i>Tony Hawk's 4</i> the best game in the series, and the best extreme sports game of them all.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>The same people who dislike all extreme sports games won't find enough changes to make them change their opinions, which is a shame because this latest instalment is a fine addition to any software collection.



<P>Players who don't like multiple button presses, directional pad dexterity, and remembering various combinations to score maximum points will balk at the gameplay offered in <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4.</i>



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It.

<HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/supermarioworld2.jpg" align=right height=108 width=108><B><I><a name="bgsmwsma2">Super 

  Mario World - Super Mario Advance 2</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance

<P><B>Who would like it: </b><I>Super Mario World</i> is one of the finest games ever to be created.  Everyone should enjoy it for its combination of excellent gameplay, control, level design, secrets galore, and huge challenge.  Platform game fans will be treated to the master at work.



<P>In its portable form, tackling the levels on the go is the stuff the GBA was made for.  With 96 "levels" to encounter, this game has gameplay that will last a very long time.  Do not miss this one.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>People who don't enjoy platform games, and that's about it.  Because every other type of gamer would find some level of enjoyment from the game, it's just got too much to offer to the player.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgyisma3.jpg" align=left><B><I><a name="bgyisma3">Yoshi's 

  Island - Super Mario Advance 3</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Another work of art.  Nintendo and Platform-game fans alike will enjoy this game.  More linear in structure compared to <i>Super Mario World</i>, but it still offers an experience unlike any other platform game.  Perfecting each level brings super tough extra levels that will have you addicted.



<P>Vastly different experience to <I>Super Mario World,</i> and arguably a superior platform game.  As was the case with <I>Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island</i> is another game that you just should not miss!



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Not a lot of people wouldn't enjoy <I>Yoshi's Island,</i> simply because it does everything right.  Only those people who hate platform games won't like this game.  The collecting-everything to get the extra levels might put some people off, but it means you get to explore every nook and cranny of each gorgeous level, and it doesn't feel monotonous unlike other games.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/wario4-boxart.jpg" align=right width=100 height=100><B><I><a name="bgwl4">Wario 

  Land 4</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Packed full of the usual Nintendo touches, such as ingenious level design and excellent control, <I>Wario Land 4</i> is an excellent game.  While it lasts, it oozes class and brings extremely high levels of fun to the gamer.  



<P>All platform game fans will lap it up, as would people looking for something a little different from the usual Mario-style gameplay.  This is a truly excellent game, and really should be played by all gamers.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Unfortunately, <i>Wario Land 4</i> has probably the shortest lifespan that most gamers will come across.  It just doesn't last long, and that's its main failing.  People who like their games to last as long as possible will not like the fact that <i>Wario Land 4</i> ends so soon.



<P>Part of the short lifespan is due to the addictiveness of the game, but the real reason is that there's just not enough levels.  If you have to buy the game to play it, please do!  Otherwise, put this at the top of the "to rent" list.  



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/bgre.jpg" align=left><B><i><a name="bgre">Resident 

  Evil</a></i></b>- GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Put simply, if youre a fan of the genre (a genre which was kicked off by the game on which this is based), you must own this game.  If you owned the original PlayStation <I>Resident Evil,</i> do not be deterred by the fact that this is a remake.



<P>Capcom claims that around 70% of the game is entirely new.  And having played both the remake and the original, I concur with Capcom.  If you have played the original, youll find a lot to like about the remake.  The massively updated visuals, the significantly improved difficulty/puzzles and the huge number of minor changes in the game will excite just about any <I>Resident Evil</i> fan.



<P><B>Who wouldnt like it: </b>Young kids and the elderly are best advised to stay away from <I>Resident Evil.</i>  The games sheer gore and violence may turn some off.  Furthermore, if youve never played a <I>Resident Evil</i> game before, you may find that the difficulty is a little too high. 



<P>Also, one of the biggest negative issues with this game is its controls; they havent changed since the original release.  If you never liked the originals controls, prepare to be frustrated by the remake.



<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Buy it.

<HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/doshin-boxart.jpg" align=right height=152 width=108><B><I><a name="doshin">Doshin the Giant</a></i></b> - GameCube - <I>Currently Exclusive to European Cube gamers.</i>



<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Fans of "God" games and Sim City-style games would find solace with <I>Doshin</i>, as much of the game is based around that style of play.  The only obvious difference is in the controls, where <I>Doshin</i> obviously utilises the GameCube's silky controller, while the usual control system is by using a keyboard and mouse.



<P>Also, it's a thinking man's game, which naturally lends itself to more patient players where strategy is king.  The gameplay is unique so those looking for something different might find <i>Doshin the Giant</i> to be a worthy addition to their collection.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>If you need lots of action and lots of things happening at once, <I>Doshin the Giant</i> isn't for you.  Those who despise repetitive tasks will also groan at <i>Doshin's</i> gameplay.



<P>As stated earlier, <I>Doshin the Giant</i> will not appeal to impatient players, who will quickly get bored or annoyed with this game.



<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Rent It.



<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-boxart.jpg" align=left height=152 width=108><B><I><a name="bgssbm">Super 

  Smash Bros. Melee</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Like <I>Super Mario Sunshine,</i> we believe that <I>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> has a very wide-reaching appeal.  If youre a fan of fighters, youll probably like it.  And if youre a fan of party games, youll definitely enjoy it.



<P><I>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> delivers on all fronts.  The single player experience is both incredibly varied as well as being quite deep.  If anything, one of the best things to be said about this game is that it has significant replay value and longevity.  Youll definitely find yourself spending hours upon hours unlocking this games many secrets.  If you have little money to spend on games, <I>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> is going to be a particularly wise purchase.



<P><B>Who wouldnt like it: </b>If youre a fan of more serious fighters, you may not be interested in <I>Super Smash Bros. Melee.</i>  Ultimately, despite the many layers of depth that the game offers, its certainly not anything like the more serious fighters out there.  On the other hand, there really isnt anything like <I>Tekken or Virtua Fighter</i> on the GameCube right now.  So if youre dying for a good fighter, <I>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> might still be worth a rental.  



<P>Also, if you dont have a lot of buddies to play this game with, then it might not be worth the money to you.  To get the most out of this game, you really do need to have plenty of people to play with on a regular basis.



<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Buy it.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/rlboxart.jpg" align=right height=152 width=108><B><I><a name="bgswrlrs2">Star 

  Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>Star Wars fans will be delighted to be given the opportunity to pilot various ships against the Dark Side.  Shooting game fans would probably like this too.



<P>The highlight is the game's first level, in which you get to relive the final scenes of Episode 4, right down to being chased by Darth Vader, saved by Han Solo, and you even get to destroy the Death Star.  One for Star Wars fans especially.



<P>Various Medal challenges serve to extend the gameplay, and the level of challenge will keep even the best occupied for days and weeks on end.  First-rate graphics and sound would also be an incentive to own the game.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Pass if you can't stand shooting games, and even some Star Wars fans should give this a miss.  It has excellent graphics throughout, but is probably a little too repetitive to be rated amongst the best games ever created.



<P>A worthwhile rent, especially for Star Wars fans, but not one for everybody.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It.

<HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/turok-boxart.jpg" align=left height=152 width=108><b><I><a name="bgte">Turok: 

  Evolution</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>If youre a die-hard <I>Turok</i> fan, you may find something to like in this title.  Despite some key differences to past <I>Turok</i> games, <I>Turok: Evolution</i> maintains a similar theme and feel to its predecessors.  



<P>Also, if youre generally a FPS nut, you might find <I>Turok: Evolution</i> enjoyable.  If you have three friends to play multipayer with, youre certainly going to get more out of this title than you otherwise might.



<P><B>Who wouldnt like it: </b>Almost everyone.  Even if youre a FPS fan, there are simply better alternatives out there.  And even if youre a hardcore <I>Turok</i> fan, you might find yourself turned off by the key differences between this latest game and previous games in the series.



<P>If youre not a FPS fan, then theres simply no argument.  Dont buy this game.



<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Avoid it.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/pikmin-box1.jpg" align=right height=152 width=108><B><I><a name="bgp">Pikmin</a></i></b> 

  - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b><I>Pikmin</i> is unlike any other game ever released on console.  Part real-time strategy game, part adventure game, there is simply nothing like <I>Pikmin.</i>  And that alone could be reason enough for Nintendo fans to own the title.  



<P>The games cute appearance hides a cleverly designed real-time strategy engine.  And thats what makes this game so fun  its easy to play and highly addictive.  Generally, if youre a fan of Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games you should seriously consider adding <I>Pikmin</i> to your GameCube library.  There really arent many games to compare Pikmin to but with that said, I recommend renting the game before you buy just to ensure that you truly enjoy it.



<P><B>Who wouldnt like it: </b>Perhaps the biggest problem with this game is its length.  The strict time limit combined with the relative lack of levels adds up to a game that is essentially pretty short.  Even after you complete the Challenge Mode, you may find yourself getting bored rather quickly.



<P>In addition, <I>Pikmins</i> unconventional gameplay might turn off some gamers.  As mentioned above, I recommend renting this game before you buy.



<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Rent it.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/waveracebs-boxart2.jpg" align=left height=152 width=108><B><I><a name="bgwrbs">Wave 

  Race: Blue Storm</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>The ones who shouldn't miss out on <I>Blue Storm</i> 

  are the fans of the original <I>Wave Race 64</i> on Nintendo 64. Racing game 

  fans should go for this, especially those who'd rather not digitally drive cars. 

  The ultra-realistic water effects, tough as nails latter courses, multiple game 

  modes, multiplayer stunt mode and race mode, all should be enough to convince 

  anyone of its quality. 

<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Obviously people who didn't like the original shouldn't go for this.  Also, those who prefer car games should stick with a different choice.  People who are easily frustrated should also give it a miss.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Buy It.

<HR>



<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/luigi-boxart.jpg" align=right height=152 width=108><I><b><a name="bglm">Luigis 

  Mansion</a></b></i>- GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b><I>Luigis Mansion</i> is a lot like <I>Pikmin,</i> in the sense that there is really nothing else like it.  Its not a platformer, nor is it a puzzle game.  The best way to describe it is simply to call it an adventure title.



<P>If youre a fan of the <I>Mario</i> series, you should definitely look into <I>Luigis Mansion.</i>  Though this game isnt a platformer, the sheer atmosphere and <I>Mario</i> themes might interest you.  The gameplay is truly unique and once you are used to the twin-stick setup (and most GameCube owners should be by now), youll have a blast.  Despite the complaints about this game, <I>Luigis Mansion</i> is most definitely more than a tech demo.  It is a surprisingly fun game while it lasts.



<P><B>Who wouldnt like it: </b>Three key words: while it lasts.  Despite the fun to be had in <I>Luigis Mansion,</i> the game simply doesnt last long enough.  A good player can zip through this game in only a couple of hours.  And despite the addition of a Hidden Mansion mode in the PAL version, youll still find very little reason to pick up this title once youve completed it.



<P>In the long term, <I>Luigis Mansion</i> is probably not worth the money.  Its fun to play while it lasts, but once again, it just doesnt have the staying power of a game like<I> Super Smash Bros. Melee.</i>



<P><B>Overall consensus: </b>Rent it.

<HR>

<P><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/GBAbattery.jpg" align=left height=120 width=156><B><I><a name="bg3pbp">GBA 3rd Party Battery Packs</a></i></b> - Game Boy Advance

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>The endless treks to the shops to continually buy AA batteries will be a thing of the past with one of these accessories.  Anyone sick of swapping batteries will find maternal comfort with these re-chargeable battery packs.



<P>Essential.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>Battery manufacturers!  In all seriousness, these are an essential accessory to the Game Boy Advance and the fact that they last around 10 hours before a recharge would keep anyone happy.  Better yet, after a few recharges, it'll have paid for itself!

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>The GBA is made for some seriously fun multiplayer sessions anywhere you want, and a 4-player link cable is an essential purchase for such an endeavour.  Games like <I>Mario Kart: Super Circuit, Advance Wars, F-Zero Maximum Velocity, etc...</i> will allow hours of fun with friends.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>If you don't foresee yourself needing to play multiplayer GBA on the go, then buying one of these will most likely be a waste of money.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It.

  to GCN Link Cable</a></i></b> - GameCube and Game Boy Advance

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>The first games to use the Link Cable were <I>Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</i> for GameCube and <I>Sonic Advance</i> for Game Boy Advance. Already <I>Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion</i> have allowed the legendary original NES <I>Metroid</i> to be played on the GameCube.  People who have the games and systems to fully utilise the cable will find it invaluable.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>People who only have one of Nintendo's current consoles will have no use for this cable.  Also, people who have no interest in taking advantage of the connection won't have any smiles for this.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It.

  3rd party Carry Case</a></I></B> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>If you constantly move your GameCube from place to place, these might be the solution for you.  No more finding pockets to house cables, no more packing everything away in the box, and no more having all your GameCube stuff in various places.  Picking up one of these will allow you to keep everything in one, neat, ordered carry case.



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>The GameCube already has a carry handle, making it as portable as can be.  Whether or not you want to be seen with a cool carry case/bag or no carry case/bag will determine its appeal to you.  We don't think it's all that important to use a carry case, but they do make nice cool looking bags to transport your Cube gear between places.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It or Avoid It.

  3rd party Game-disc Wallet</a></i></b> - GameCube

<P><B>Who would like it: </b>If you have lots of games, and can't stand bringing lots of cases around, a Game-disc wallet is the perfect accessory.  You'll be able to keep everything in the one container, and even have the games dangling from your belt!



<P><B>Who wouldn't like it: </b>We don't see the incessant need to store your game discs anywhere but in the DVD case that they came in, and if you're the type of person who keeps all their discs in the case they came in, a wallet will be a waste of time.   Not an essential buy for everyone, but some of you may have a practical use for such a thing.



<P><B>Overall Consensus: </b>Rent It or Avoid It.

<P>Phew, after all that, we hope that somebody you know, somewhere in Australia and/or Europe, gets something that they've been dreaming of this Christmas.  We certainly hope that we've steered you in the right direction, and the only thing left for us to say is "till next year!".  



<P>2003 will be a rocking good time for all PAL players.  Some of the biggest games ever in GameCube's lifetime will be released.  Gameboy Advance will enjoy 3rd and 4th generation software.  And we might even see some online gaming on our GameCubes next year.  Exciting times indeed.  See you next year!!
