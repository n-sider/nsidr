<p>The <a href="http://www.gunpey-r.com/ds/index.html">official <cite>Gunpey</cite> site</a> has posted video (last button on the left) of the previously-announced in-game sequencer.

<p>The sequencer seems to be a simple five-channel type and appears to provide the ability to make your own music to play in the game.  Namco Bandai has announced they will <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2286">bring Gunpey stateside</a> this holiday season.</p>
