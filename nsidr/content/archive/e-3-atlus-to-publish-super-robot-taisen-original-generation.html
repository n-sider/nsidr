<li>Story: Nearly two centuries ago, humanity advanced into space, ushering in the dawn of a new era&mdash;the Space Era. But mankind's technological progress came to a near-halt after the devastation and turmoil caused by two meteors that struck the Earth in the early years of the 21st century. In 179 S.E., a third meteor, Meteor 3, landed near the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific. A research team dispatched by the Earth Federal Government discovered that the "meteor" contained technology previously unknown to man. An investigative committee was formed to analyze Meteor 3 and the technology within, which became known as Extra-Over Technology. Dr. Bian Zoldark, head of the committee, reported to the EFG that the creators of Meteor 3 would almost certainly come to Earth to reclaim their technology. The EFG heeded Dr. Zoldark's warning, and began the development of humanoid mobile units called Personal Troopers.
