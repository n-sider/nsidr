<p>Intrepid observers at DS-x2 have <a href="http://www.ds-x2.com/index.php?id=5086">found</a>, from the German USK's tested games list, a listing for a new <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><cite>Nintendogs</cite></a> version: <cite>Dalmatian & Friends</cite>.</p>

<p>The title previously and <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php?id=137933">briefly appeared</a> on retailer GAME's website, according to CVG.  It was originally listed for a June 16 release, then was changed to Q2 2006 before disappearing entirely.  Contacted for comment at that time, Nintendo told CVG the game was "an error on GAME's website and has now been removed. Nintendo have made no new announcements."</p>

<p><cite>Nintendogs</cite> has been quite a seller in Europe, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1754">moving two million copies</a> and commanding an unspecified (yet apparently large) share of female purchasers.  It's unknown whether the new title, if it does indeed get announced, will have any new elements or will simply be another remix of the existing breeds in the game, though it will most likely be the latter because versions need to be compatible with each other for the game's Bark Mode functionality.</p>
