<p>It doesn't look like Konami and Nintendo are done with new software announcements.  Konami of Europe said today it will bring a new Castlevania game to the Nintendo DS later this year.</p>

<p>The storyline of the new Castlevania will take place in the year 2036.  The story will continue where it left off in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. The title will utilize its traditional 2D side scrolling action but will also take advantage of the many features of the Nintendo DS hardware, such as the touch screen.</p>
