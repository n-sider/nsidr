<p>We've decided to copy <a href="http://www.nintendorks.com">Nintendork's</a> exclusive link to an interview with Miyamoto by the Washington Times.  The interview is right over <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/entertainment/20040616-095519-1583r.htm">here</a>, or if you would prefer to use Nintendork's excessively sensual route, go <a href="http://www.nintendorks.com/archives/000633.php#more">here</a>.</p>
