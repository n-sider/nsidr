<i>Column by <a href="staffview.php?staffid=10">Jeff Van Camp</a></i>

<p><b>Edition: 01-08-2006</b>

<p>Two minds...one column. Two motives...one goal. Two editors...one conversation. You have now entered a dimension unlike any other. This is N-Banter.

<p>This edition of N-Banter, being the first of 2006, is going to be a bit different. The following is a conversation I had with a guy I used to play Tribes 2 (PC) with way back in the day. Our topic of discussion: the Revolution. Enjoy.

<p><hr>

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>When is the Revolution coming?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I'm guessing late 2006. In time for the holiday season.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>I think the revolution might suck.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Hah. Anything's possible.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>The controller looks dumb.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Looks can be deceiving. It's going to come down to the games and whether they use all of the awesome features of the controller.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>There arent many good games on the GameCube anyways. Mario, Zelda, and what Resident Evil.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Sure there are. There are quite a few fun games that have hit the Cube. The GCN is a very different machine than Revolution though. Theyre targeting different markets.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>The Cube is like for kids though. Well, comparing it to the Xbox and PS2. Im assuming the Rev will be the same

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>In perception sure. Games like Mario and whatnot are very accessible for kids so Im sure they might skew a bit young, but that means nothing. Nintendo has always been a company that creates games for all ages. The fact that I, a 21 year old, am still a very big fan says something.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>That there is still a kid inside you?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>No, that I like good games. Nintendo makes good games. End of story, really. That's why they're still around. I think that if you actually looked at the numbers, a lot of people who have bought a GCN are either families with parents who remember the NES or people like me who are longtime fans.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>The only truly awesome game that came out for a Nintendo console is GoldenEye. I respect that game.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>GoldenEye was great. I loved it. But if that's the only good Nintendo game, then there are very few games you must like at all on any system.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>That is true. I rent games for the storyline. There are few that i own and play often. I can see why families would buy a Cube over an Xbox, little violence. They want to protect their children.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The difference between the Revolution and GameCube is that Nintendo is not going for the same exact audience as Microsoft and Sony this time around. They are going to have a cheaper console and are actively trying to court fans, as well as non-gamers. Nintendo would like the Revolution to be a console that a grandparent, 20-something, teenager, and kid would play together. I think it's a great goal. We have to remember that we were all kids when we started gaming. So to criticize Nintendo solely for appealing to children is hypocritical. Even if you disagree with Nintendo on some of the choices it makes, you have to admit that at least it's trying something new. More than you can say for Sony or Microsoft at the moment.

<p>I'm actually really excited at how awesome First Person Shooters may play on the Revolution. Some are saying it's better than a Keyboard/mouse configuration.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>A lot of the Nintendo games are getting a little repetitive, how many god damn Mario games are there now. 

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I agree. Completely. I can't stand Mario Party. Not since the second one. There are plenty of games I don't play anymore. But there are plenty more that I enjoy.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>The same would go with other systems to though, Final Fantasy, fucking like 15 Final Fantasties.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Heh, yup.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>When are they going to bring Duck Hunt back? Games with guns were awesome. Area 51.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Well Revolution will be completely backward compatible. Meaning that you can download old NES, SNES, N64 games onto its internal memory and play them.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>But you need a gun to play Duck Hunt.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Well no. Not anymore. I believe the top of the revolution controller has a light gun thing on it. So all controllers will be equipped with a light gun. With a standard like that there will probably be a lot of shooting games.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>Ugh. Same thing again. Protection of children.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Hmm?

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>Plugging a gun into your console and shooting at the screen is/was awesome.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah and I'm telling you that the controller can do that even without a gun attachment. That means that more games will be able to use the functionality. It's a good thing.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>That isn't fun though. Holding the gun is the fun part. Not a controller.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The controller is also upgradeable cheaply. If a game like Duck Hunt or whatever wanted the controller to be a gun, they could make an attachment that shaped it like a gun.</p>

<br><p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Those are three different mockups I found on the net. Stuff like that could ship with the game relatively cheaply (or so Nintendo says) and you just plug it into the back of the controller. The system will come with a nunchuck style add on from the get go which gives you an analog stick.</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/n-banter_01-08-2006_nunchuck.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; background: #99CCFF; padding: 2px; border: 1px solid black; border-top: none;">The Nunchuck attachment.</td></tr></table>

<br><p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>Is that the controller on the top of the gun you attach?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah the controller is plugged into the top of those attachments.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>That makes sense. I don't know about that controller and joystick thing though.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah Ive seen some awesome ideas. I saw one drawing of a steering wheel attachment. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>I can't even play games with a joystick and keyboard at the same type. If they were together like in the Xbox/PS2 controller, easily. So do you just mash one button instead of the typical four?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>For some games you could even hold a Revolution controller in each hand, having two sensors. There will also be a classic style controller shell that will look more like a regular controller. If Nintendos smart, it will ship with the system too, along with the nunchuck one.</p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/n-banter_01-08-2006_shell.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; background: #99CCFF; padding: 2px; border: 1px solid black; border-top: none;">IGN Mockup of the shell</td></tr></table>

<br><p>The shell might look something like this. This is a mockup. Or it could (and likely will) have a standard configuration like the Xbox and PS2.


<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>So do you play the controller how it's picture or can you play it uh horizontal?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Oh, you can tilt the controller on its side and play it horizontal too. That might be good for say a racing game or something. Also an easy way to play old NES games.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>Interesting. You are full of pictures.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah I'm googling like mad. Want to see the video showing people using the controller? Nintendo showed a video when they debuted the controller.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>Not really.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Okay, whatever. Haha. Shows a lot of stuff. Fun.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>What is that other Nintendo thing. Uhthat really small Game Boy?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Game Boy Micro. Its just a small stylized Game Boy Advance.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>Do they want you to lose it?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Haha, I didn't get one. They are pretty cool looking though. I wanted them to pack an MP3 player with it. If they did that, I would have thought about it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Watch <a href=http://media.cube.ign.com/articles/651/651334/vid s_1.html>this</a>. It's all exaggerated movements and stuff of course, but there is a lot of cool things it could do.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>What is this?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>A video. Its the only Nintendo released Revolution video. They're finally going online too. I'm not trying to say it's going to kill or destroy any other console. I'm just saying that if Nintendo makes the right games (it's very capable) and markets it correctly, it could be a very big success and a great step for video games.

<p><b><font color="blue">Aitro: </font></b>Yeah, maybe it could.
