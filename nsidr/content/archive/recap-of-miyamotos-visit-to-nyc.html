<p>This past Sunday, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> made an appearance at <a href="http://www.nintendoworldstore.com/">Nintendo World</a> in New York City.  During his visit, Miyamoto signed numerous T-shirts, classic and current games, as well as consoles ranging from the NES to the Gamecube.</p>

<p>Also at the event, Nintendogs owners were able to wirelessly unlock the Jack Russell terrier in their own copies of the game by using Bark Mode and receive a voice message from actress Haylie Duff.</p>
