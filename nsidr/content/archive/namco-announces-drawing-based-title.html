<p>By way of Jeux-France comes <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news13887_kaitou-ruso-ds-un-concept-original.html">news of a very unique title</a> from Namco slated for release on the Nintendo DS in Japan.</p>

<p><i>Kaitou Ruso DS</i> finds the game's protagonist, Ruso, with a canvas for a face that the player can draw on to influence how the game plays out.  In one shot, the player has drawn Ruso a face that permits him to blend in with a window in the background, making him invisible to the policemen.</p>

<p>The game is currently in the works for a yet-undated Japanese release.</p>
