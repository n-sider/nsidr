Environmental activist outfit Greenpeace has released their 2007 "Guide to Greener Electronics", and they're making much ado about the first-ever zero ranking they've handed out to Nintendo.  Actually reading the report in question, though, reveals that the bottom-of-the-barrel evaluation has less to do with Nintendo's actual environmental performance and more about criteria Greenpeace has set forth for being "greener" and Nintendo's lack of website-published information addressing them.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/greener-electronics-nintendo-r.pdf">report on Nintendo</a> seems to fault the company for not publishing information on their website about various environmental manufacturing issues ranging from chemical use to recycling of old products.  On the "Detailed Scoring" page, every last item either reads "no information" or simply links to Nintendo of America's <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/corp/faq.jsp#environment">corporate FAQ</a>, a bullet-point list of environmental highlights, and notes that the particular issue is not addressed therein.<br />
