<p>Over in Europe, the mysterious land where <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><cite>Nintendogs</cite></a> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1754">outperforms all other territories</a>, Nintendo has just confirmed that they will be making available <cite>Nintendogs Dalmatian & Friends Edition</cite> on June 16.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1945">Previously rumored</a>, the title may actually be introducing new breeds. We previously speculated this wouldn't be the case, as any breeds not appearing on the original versions of the game would be incompatible with the game's Bark Mode functionality, which lets people put their DS into sleep mode and have their dogs play with nearby <cite>Nintendogs</cite> owner's pups.  However, there are twenty breeds, including the two hidden breeds, in the original game, and Nintendo Europe claims <cite>Dalmatian</cite> has "over twenty".</p>
