Capcom is set to increase their Wii commitment by doubling the number of titles they have headed for the system to six, noting they expect sales to go up 11% for the year as they do so&mdash;and they're seeing <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=axZUWTytK5tA">record stock prices</a> on expectations they'll be succeeding with the platform.<br />
<br />
The benchmark so far is <i>Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition</i>, which is expected to beat Capcom's original ship estimates.  On the horizon, Capcom has <i>Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles</i>&mdash;intended for use with the Wii Zapper, which Nintendo will start selling November 19&mdash;and the lesser-known <i>Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure</i>.  New titles have yet to be announced, but we're waiting with bated breath.
