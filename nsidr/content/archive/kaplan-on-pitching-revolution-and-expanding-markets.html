<p>Next Generation recently sat down with NOA VP of marketing and corporate affairs <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a> to talk about Nintendo's position in the market with Revolution coming up on the radar very soon, how Nintendo plans to pitch it, and how Nintendo has been expanding the market for gaming.  Some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On targeting "core gamers" and new markets simultaneously: "Brain Training is a good example. When we show that to a core gamer they immediately see were the challenge lies. They like to beat the game. Other people pick Brain Training up and they see that it is very easy to play. It is enticing and challenging. Core gamers are loving these products as are new players. But we also have all those games that the core gamers have always loved. We won't walk away from that."</p></li>

<li><p>On Revolution at E3: "We will have enough games on show, that will keep people interested until launch...</p>

<p>"At this show and beyond, it's about people getting a hands-on experience. If you play Revolution for yourself and experience the software, it's much better than me telling you about what our message is all about. It's kinda like your own rollercoaster ride. It's always going to be different for everyone."</p></li>

<li><p>On GameCube's market position: "GameCube's reputation suffers much more than its game sales do. Not that it is the leader of the pack but it outsold 360 at launch and during the holiday period and it outsold Xbox.

<p>"...It's far from dead. The perception of it is different from the actual sales and there is still a lot left life in it."</p></li>

<li><p>On marketing Revolution: "The whole point about touching it and experiencing it and riding the ride is one of our biggest challenges and one of our biggest opportunities. Once it comes to retail, and the viral component of the campaign takes hold, we'll try to bring consumers in to try Revolution for themselves."</p></li>

<li><p>On predicting Revolution's market take: "We aren't predicting percentages at this point. But I can tell you that we believe we are different and innovative enough to chart our own territory. If you look at the horserace we have high hopes of having a prominent position."</p></li>
