<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-03-21-nsmb_logo.jpeg" alt="New Super Mario Bros. logo" align="right" style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Previously slated for release May 7, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876"><i>New Super Mario Bros.</i></a> has been quietly pushed to May 15 on Nintendo's release calendar.</p>

<p>Astute observers will note that May 15 is a Monday, and as such is in-line with Nintendo of America's Monday game ship tradition, as opposed to the earlier commitment of May 7 &mdash; as a Sunday, it fueled speculation that the DS Lite would be releasing to North America at the same time.  Current wisdom holds that Nintendo wants to satisfy the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1819">frothing demand</a> for the Lite in Japan and ramp up manufacturing capacity before trying to bring the handheld over here.</p>
