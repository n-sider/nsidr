Nielsen has <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/8985/10009/nielsen-data-tracking-games-industry.phtml">released</a> the first numbers gleaned from its games-industry tracking service, GamePlay Metrics. Mostly known for tracking TV ratings, Nielsen is using this new tracking service to determine who is playing what games, when they're playing, and what they do when they're not gaming.<br />
<br />
According to Nielsen, despite Wii being the cheapest of the current generation of consoles, it is currently most likely to be found in households with an annual income of over $100,000.<br />
<br />
The data also showed that the Playstation 2 currently takes up the majority of gaming time among gamers, at 42.3% of all console playtime. The original Xbox is at 17%, 360 at 8%, Gamecube at 5.8%, Wii at 4%, and PS3 at 3%.<br />
<br />
These numbers are taken from a sample of 12,000 households&mdash;about 33,000 people. If they are at all indicative of the rest of the gaming world, it's obvious that Wii, despite consistently selling out in America, has a lot of catching up to do.
