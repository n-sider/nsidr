<H3>v4 - N-Sider Reborn</H3>

<P>It seems like only yesterday that N-Sider was born.  Our humble little site first saw the light of day on the eve of Nintendo's Space World show in 2000.  And since then, we've provided a unique brand of coverage for Nintendo enthusiasts across the globe.</P>

<P>The most recent iteration of our site (Version 3) was an attempt to re-confirm our focus on quality writing, intelligent industry analysis and in-depth features; all with a unique Nintendo-centric perspective.  But despite a renewed commitment to the key hallmarks of N-Sider, there were limitations.  Time became a serious issue for most of our staff and as a result, we were unable to deliver a frequent stream of high quality articles.  We had also experienced problems with the implementation of Version 3, which resulted in a less-than-focused site.</P>

<P>As 2003 unfolded, the landscape surrounding N-Sider changed.  The online media continued to shift in new directions and the industry itself continued to expand and mature.  When faced with the interminable development within the online media and the industry at large, as well as the realities of our own site, the N-Sider executive team came to a firm decision; it was time to break free from existing restrictions and fulfill N-Sider's promise as a truly unique presence in the industry.</P>

<P>What you see in front of you is a project that has been in development for months.  Version 4 is a combination of N-Sider's outstanding writing talent, world-class artists and expert programmers.  And we think you'll agree with us when we say that the result is nothing short of phenomenal.  Our determination to develop the world's most in-depth Nintendo resource is evident in the sheer breadth of content on offer.  Our all-new <A HREF="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/what-is-n-data">N-Data</A> index (itself the result of years of work) is a prime example of what makes Version 4 such an important venture.</P>

<P>Of course, it doesn't stop there.  Over the coming days, weeks and months, you will see a continual stream of new articles, which examine just about every aspect of your favorite video game company.  We will continue to provide you with the kind of intelligence, depth and understanding that you have come to expect from us over the years.  There's also the amazing new N-Universe, which we will be unveiling on the 16th of February.  We are certain that you'll find it worth the wait.</P>

<P>As a final word, we'd like to take a moment to thank the many individuals who were involved in the creation of our new baby.  We'd like to thank Cory Faller and James Burns for developing our all-new design, Matthew Musselman for lovingly rendering the beautiful artwork at the top of every page, Dean Bergmann for implementing our new design onto the N-Forums and above all, we would like to thank our writers for working tirelessly on a broad variety of articles for the launch and beyond.</P>

<P>If you love Nintendo as much as we do, we have only one message for you: welcome home.</P>

<P><i>N-Sider Executive Team</i></P>
