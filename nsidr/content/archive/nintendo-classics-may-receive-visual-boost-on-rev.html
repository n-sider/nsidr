<p>Nintendo said it is deciding whether or not it will provide updated visuals to retro game titles offered on the virtual gaming Revolution network.</p>

<p>"We are doing several experiments, including working with the original Super Mario Bros., with the new technology," said Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in a recent interview with Electronic Gaming Monthly. "The game itself and the gameplay shall be identical, but the look will be different; it's possible that with Revolution, we may be able to see the old games with new looks."</p>
