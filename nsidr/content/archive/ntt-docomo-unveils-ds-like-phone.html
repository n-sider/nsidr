<br />
The phone, known by the D800iDS moniker, eschews the traditional number pad in favor of a touch-sensitive bottom screen (where have we heard that before?) and is available in the DS Lite's trademark white.  Nintendo is not involved in the handset in any way; it's simply a nod to the styling of their ubiquitous-across-Japan handheld.  And yes, the press shot does show a game being played.
