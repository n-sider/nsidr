Zentendo has <a href="http://www.zentendo.com/news.php?newsId=320">unearthed</a> a job posting <a href="https://nintendo.taleo.net/servlets/CareerSection?art_ip_action=FlowDispatcher&flowTypeNo=13&pageSeq=2&reqNo=21740&art_servlet_language=en&csNo=10000&JServSessionIdnintendo=1d06aslfpbmqx2hc1.RJS2421_2422#topOfCsPage">for a Licensing Manager</a> for NOA's Nintendo Power magazine, confirming earlier rumors the magazine was to be moved out of its longstanding in-house position and into the hands of a contractor, much like the also-Future-run Official Nintendo Magazine over in Europe.<br />
<br />
The news comes on the heels of the closure of the confusingly named NSider Forums at Nintendo.com, which was announced yesterday with a message posted on their site.  Nintendo of America is promising a redesign for Nintendo.com, and it seems plausible to speculate that the Future deal might be related to this action.
