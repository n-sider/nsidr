Visit the game's official <a href="http://www.ubi.com/US/Games/Info.aspx?pId=4321">website</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Lost Magic is a top-down RPG where players can summon monsters and cast one of six magic spells using the touch screen. The game is also compatible with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service enabling players to challenge friends in a duel mode.</p>

"LostMagic, then, is a game that combines some of the best features of action RPGs and real-time strategy games, and then throws a PokÃ¨mon-style monster collection and a moves (ok, spells) list that's comparable to those of any fighting game into the mix. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable game that, although not without a few flaws and frustrations, starts well and simply gets deeper and better as you spend more time with it."

"Lostmagic can never quite overcome the fact that it's poorly balanced and difficult. Selecting the individual units you want when they're all bunched up can also be a problem, and they'll sometimes strike out on their own, undoing your planning. Between the speedy gameplay, the challenge and the control issues, you're going to die a lot. And that's a drag. But even so, there's a lot to like about this game. It plays to the DS' strengths, and when it all clicks, it's a lot of fun. Just be prepared to brute force your way through a lot of frustrating misfires if you decide to go for it."

<a href="http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/ds/games/reviews/53675.shtml">GamePro.com</a> says (3.5/5),<br>
"Lost Magic isn't necessarily a standardized RPG in the sense that players are unable to purchase upgrades, level up in an open field, equip armor or items, and cannot level up separate stats, most of these features being the fundamental factors in some RPGs. The controls are intuitive and creative, the graphics are dull, and the sound is reminiscent of RPGs from older systems. In all, Lost Magic strives to accomplish something innovative and enjoyable, it falls short in its implementation, resulting in a game that frustrates and disappoints."
