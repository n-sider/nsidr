Nintendo has opted to tout some knowledge about <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> that has, until now, been the exclusive province of message board denizens: the game sits atop <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/simpleratings.asp?rankings=y">GameRankings' all-inclusive rankings chart</a>, scoring the highest review score average of any game the site carries scores for.<br />
<br />
Nintendo also noted something we didn't know: internal sales figures put first-week sales of the title at 500,000 units.  The numbers are refreshing in light of Galaxy's Japanese debut, which tracked below Super Mario series pariah (as far as such a well-regarded series can even <i>have</i> a pariah) <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, moving approximately 250,000 copies in its first week on sale.
