Nintendo of America said today that Nintendo intends to supply four million Wii systems globally in the six weeks between the launch of the system in North America November 19 and the end of 2006.<br />
<br />
"Wii is for both experienced and uninitiated gamers, and it will be available for the masses," said NOA president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>. "Because of demand, we're urging shoppers not to get complacent. The level of demand we're seeing goes beyond the ordinary. Retailers are telling us a significant fraction of customers pre-ordering Wii are nontraditional gamers&mdash;people looking for a better way to play. And that's exactly what Wii is designed to provide."<br />
<br />
Nintendo passes on several stories it sees as pointing towards their hope for Wii's widespread appeal, including two women in their 20's and 30's preordering systems for themselves, and a wide range of people in <a href="http://www.myspace.com/howwiiplay">the Wii MySpace community</a> from teens to 50's, male and female, and all walks of gaming life (non to lapsed to hardcore) expressing interested in Wii.  Time will tell if Wii carries the torch as well as Nintendo hopes it will.
