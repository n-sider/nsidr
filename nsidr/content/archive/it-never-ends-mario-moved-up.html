<p>Did you believe us when we told you a mere five days ago that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876">New Super Mario Bros.</a> would <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1896">release May 21</a>?  Well, scratch that.</p>

<p>Eagle-eyed observers at 4 color rebellion have noted <a href="http://mario.nintendo.com/">the official minisite</a> for the game has it once again listed for a May 15 release, on Monday just like any other Nintendo-published software.  This once again wreaks havoc with the theory that Nintendo will release the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS lite</a> alongside the title.</p>

<p>If we had to guess why the title keeps getting shuffled around, Nintendo's having a bit of a hard time pinning down the lite's release date internally.  Demand for the luminous hardware revision is still very strong in Japan, having <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/838-Sales-In-Japan-For-March-13-March-19,-2006.html">sold nearly 120,000 units</a> just over two weeks ago.      In fact, a recent <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000101&sid=aKwSAyyfYBkM">report on Nintendo's financials</a> noted that the company had to sell units intended for export to meet Japanese demand.</p>

<p>We'll keep you posted if the date moves again.  Which, if recent history is anything to go by, it probably will.</p>
