Last August, I put together a piece, based on my ideas and other N-Siders', about <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/animal-crossing-iii">what <i>Animal Crossing Wii</i> could offer</a>.  While I certainly don't expect a game precisely in that mold, I've often thought that in order to justify itself to me, a Wii sequel needs to offer <i>something</i> wonderful in order to overcome a big problem: Animal Crossing Wii would, by virtue of being thrown up on the big screen instead of being handheld, be rather impersonal.<br />
<br />
Of course, this wasn't a problem with <i>Animal Crossing</i>, but things have changed now; I've tasted what it's like to be able to bury myself in my own little private world, not having to compete with family for TV time, and feeling like inviting a local friend over is really like having them there rather than watching them waltz through my town unescorted.  I'm also simply wary of having the Wii tied up at all hours while I, my wife, and my daughter&#8212;newly into the Animal Crossing world&#8212;each spend an hour plus seeking out bugs, watering flowers, and chatting with the residents.<br />
<br />
But last night, my wife proposed an ingenious solution to the problem: simply permit everyone to play at the same time, <i>Crystal Chronicles</i>-style.  Thinking further on it, it might even be a compelling reason to get DS connectivity going, for inventory management; though I think it would be a mistake for Nintendo to make it a requirement.  The prospect is enticing, though; we could all opt to fish together, pick weeds together, etc. all at the same time.<br />
<br />
Such a move would greatly increase the chance that I'd consider getting into Animal Crossing Wii.  As it stands right now, I'm still pretty happy with Wild World&#8212;and would consider a move to the console a step down if changes like this aren't considered.
