I'm trying to figure out if Konami's Shingo Mukaitoge&mdash;the guy behind <i>Elebits</i> and <i>Dewy's Adventure</i>&mdash;is also behind the new DS adventure <i>Elebits: The Adventures of Kai and Zero</i>.  (If you have proof one way or the other, please do shoot me an e-mail!)  My Googling led me to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3468/konamis_wii_wizard_an_interview_.php">an interview</a> I'd not read before, from the post-<i>Dewy</i> period, where he makes this very interesting statement on page 3 (emphasis mine):<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">I would say <i>Elebits</i> was one of the goals that I've been striving for. But also, the thing I wanted to do from the beginning... how shall I say. <b>I personally love <i>Zelda</i>, and I want to make an RPG that is much better than it.</b></div><br />
<div class="align_left"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3820-1.jpg" width="158" height="119" class="image_styled" /></div>I find this quote very interesting in light of my recent <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/elebits-2-demo-suggests-a-full-fledged-adventure">demo playtime</a> with <i>Kai and Zero</i>&mdash;I noted myself that it seemed reminiscent of 2-D <i>Zelda</i> outings.  I wonder, if Mukaitoge is indeed behind this title in some capacity, is it the realization of this desire?<br />
<br />
The new DS <i>Elebits</i> title is, as far as we know, in stores now, so the answer to this question is very near indeed.
