<p>Electronic Arts executive VP and COO of worldwide studios David Gardner <a href="http://www.mcvuk.com/newsitem.php?id=24253">revealed to MCV</a> that the publisher is starting to refocus its handheld efforts on Nintendo DS in light of what he feels are negatives on the price and performance of its competitor, Sony's PlayStation Portable.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt that EA has historically bet more on PSP," Gardner explained.  "I think we were excited by the technology, but the consumers have proven that actually what they want is fun. We must never forget that what we need to focus on is fun and so EA is putting more effort behind DS games&mdash;and creative ones that really take advantage of the hardware."</p>

<p>This commentary is part of a continuation of big Nintendo support from EA.  The publisher has as of late put a lot of weight behind Nintendo's upcoming Wii home console, establishing a special group within its Burnaby studio to create games specifically for Wii&mdash;although at present, these titles are generally entries in their established franchises.</p>
