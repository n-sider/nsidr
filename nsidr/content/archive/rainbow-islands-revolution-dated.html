<p><a href="http://www.risingstargames.com/">Rising Star Games</a> has announced that it will bring <i>Rainbow Islands Revolution</i>, a reimagining of the Taito classic <i>Rainbow Islands</i>, to the Nintendo DS in February 2006.  Rising Star has previously brought Space Invaders Revolution and Bubble Bobble Revolution to the DS.</p>

<p><i>Rainbow Islands Revolution</i>, unlike the classic vertical platformer that had the player jumping on platforms and firing small rainbows that could be used as steps and weapons, is entirely touch-driven.  The new title has the player's character (Bub or Bob) encased in a floating bubble that can be dragged around the screen, and drawing rainbows directly onto the screen to do things such as trap enemies.  The player's rainbow power is initially limited, but can be powered up.  Bonus modes are also available.</p>

<p>The title's look-and-feel is described as "classic Taito", but also features new player sprites designed by Harvest Moon artist Igusa Matsuyama.  Rising Star plans to announce an additional single-player mode as well as two multiplayer modes when the game comes closer to release.</p>
