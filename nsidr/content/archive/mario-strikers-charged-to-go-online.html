When <i>Mario Strikers Charged</i> releases in Europe this May (as "Mario Strikers: Charged Football"), it will feature online multiplayer via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, with competitive play "across the globe", Nintendo of Europe revealed today.<br />
<br />
Leaderboards will feature in the title's online Ranked mode, where players compete to improve their ranking.  Unranked mode is also available, giving players the opportunity to "quickly select and play friends", implying there may be some sort of lobby feature.<br />
<br />
Mario Strikers Charged will release in Europe on May 25.  Nintendo of America has the game pencilled in for a summer release stateside.
