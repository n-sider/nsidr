We noted last month that Aksys was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2626">working on a remake</a> of PlayStation strategy RPG <i>Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth</i> on the Nintendo DS, but didn't have any news on whether it would be coming stateside, and if so, by whose hand.<br />
<br />
Aksys has announced today that it will be publishing the title here itself.  The DS remake will feature a brand new character and missions as well as a new localization.  An enhanced, stylus-optional user interface will also be making an appearance.<br />
<br />
<i>Hoshigami Remix</i> is slated for release this summer.  It has not yet been given a rating by the ESRB, and will retail for $29.99.
