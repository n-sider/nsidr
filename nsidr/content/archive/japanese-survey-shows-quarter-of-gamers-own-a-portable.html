<p>Otona Fami conducted a survey in Japan that shows 14 percent of avid gamers own a PSP and 25 percent own a Nintendo DS, according to Next-Gen.biz.  Around 33 percent said they plan to buy one or both portables in the future.</p>

<p>Only 25 percent of PSP owners believe they are fully utilizing the capabilities of the machine, while 33 percent of DS owners feel they are getting the most out of its features.</p>

<p>PSP owners were unhappy with the variety and originality of games as well as loading times. Most of the Nintendo DS owners said they play every day.  However, half of its users say the screens are too small and that there are few games that make good use of the two screens.</p>
