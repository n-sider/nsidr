LucasArts said it will be more mindful in its management of the <i>Star Wars</i> license for video games, according to Next-Gen.biz.  The company states they will approach the release of <i>Star Wars</i> games carefully with perhaps only two titles a year.<br>
<br>  
"Star Wars game releases will become genuine media events, as opposed to occasions for quiet trepidation among the faithful," John Geoghegan, LucasArts vice president global sales and marketing told Next-Gen. "The games will be scarcer and better quality. They will be street dated, with simultaneous worldwide releases across platforms."<br>
<br>
LucasArts hopes this will give the license longevity and retain its value among the fans and casual audience.
