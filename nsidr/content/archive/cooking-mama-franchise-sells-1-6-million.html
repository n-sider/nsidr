Majesco Entertainment, the Cinderella story who turned their publishing business around by investing in more casual fare for Nintendo platforms, announced today that their popular Cooking Mama franchise has hit 1.6 million in U.S. sales since it launched with the original Nintendo DS title <i>Cooking Mama</i> in September 2006.<br />
<br />
The franchise includes the original game, <i>Cooking Mama: Cook Off</i> for Wii, and <i>Cooking Mama 2: Dinner With Friends</i>.  The original Mama was far and away the biggest success story, moving over 1 million copies.  A Wii sequel to Cook Off is in the works and Majesco plans to release it this year.  The franchise is handled abroad by Taito in Japan (where it debuted prior to its U.S. release), and by 505 Games in Europe.
