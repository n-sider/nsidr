<div class="header">The Rise of Realism</div><br />
The late 1980's and early 1990's were a time of enormous growth for the video game industry, particularly in America.  Having only barely avoided becoming a historical footnote in the early 1980's (in large part due to the successes of Nintendo's Famicom/NES platform), video games had quickly become an entertainment juggernaut that began to seriously challenge the film and music industries in terms of market size and financial power.<br />
<br />
During this period, two simultaneous challenges arose: the rise of so-called "multimedia" technology, coupled with the ability to generate more realistic graphics in video games.<br />
<br />
The arrival of 16 and 32-bit consoles allowed software developers to give birth to animation techniques such as motion capture and sophisticated photo-realistic digitization of live-action performers (<i>Mortal Kombat</i> championed the digitization technique).  These advances dovetailed with the arrival of the CD-ROM as a medium for storing game data (the principle examples from the era being the Sega CD platform and, to a lesser extent, Panasonic's 3DO).  CD-ROM allowed for numerous advances in video game graphics; arguably none were more evident than the introduction of full motion video, which could be interspersed throughout the game (in the form of 'cut-scenes') or from which the game's graphics could be comprised in their entirety.<br />

The digitized characters in <i>Mortal Kombat</i> were the most realistic yet seen in video games.  Footage of real actors was converted into two-dimensional sprites, which players could directly control.  These characters were a million miles away from the simplistic collection of pixels that had represented characters like <i>Mario</i> and <i>Donkey Kong</i> only a few years earlier.  <i>Mortal Kombat</i> attracted controversy not specifically due to its photo realistic characters, but because of the gruesome context they found themselves in.  The game contained vicious 'finishing moves' called <i>fatalaties</i>, which generally involved one character impaling or otherwise dismembering another in the most graphic way possible.<br />
<br />
Full motion video was used in a variety of ways.  Data East created a game for the Sega CD platform called <i>Road Avenger</i>, which essentially consisted of on-screen instructions overlaid on pre-recorded animated footage.  Perhaps the most infamous application of the technology, however, was for the Digital Pictures-developed game <i>Night Trap</i>, which allows the player to view live-action footage through multiple hidden cameras in a house.  The player must then activate traps in different rooms in order to capture the "Augers" (who are the game's vampire-like antagonists).<br />

One consequence of this rapid technological advancement was that the broader regulatory environment could not keep pace.  Nintendo had always maintained a degree of content control over its licensees (although for the most part, it had only exercised this control in relation to games with sexual content; violence had not been considered a point of concern).  However, other platform creators whose prominence was growing throughout the late 1980's did not have their own content control systems.<br />
<br />
As a result, developers were able to push the boundaries in terms of producing content that was, for the most part, principally suited to adult audiences.  And it was not long before prominent public figures began to express concern that the boundaries had been pushed too far.<br />

These significantly more graphic games began to arouse debate across American society.  To make matters worse, several publishers were accused of deliberately targeting their 'adult' games towards children in television and print advertisements.<br />

The public debate culminated with hours of hearings in the U.S. Senate, related to video game violence and its impact on society.  The hearings were held between late 1993 and early 1994.  Several people testified on behalf of the American video game industry, but the two most prominent speakers were Nintendo's Howard Lincoln and Sega of America's vice president of marketing, Bill White.  The hearings were headed by Senators Joseph Lieberman, Herbert Kohl and Byron Dorgan.  The purpose of the hearings was clear: to examine how, exactly, the video game industry intended to manage 'adult' content going forward in a way that would be acceptable to the public.
