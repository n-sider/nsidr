<br />
Lincoln joined Nintendo of America as Senior Vice President and General Counsel in 1983, where a combination of his cool demeanor and impeccable legal skills helped to save the fledgling subsidiary from several potentially fatal lawsuits.<br />
<br />
Alongside former Nintendo of America president (and great friend) Minoru Arakawa, Howard Lincoln literally resurrected an industry that many had written off after the infamous collapse of Atari at the dawn of the 1980's.<br />
<br />
In addition, Lincoln played a leading role as the industry's primary defender during Senate hearings on video game violence in the early 1990's.  The ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) was established as a result and continues to provide a significant buffer between government and industry.<br />
<br />
Howard Lincoln's impact can also be felt beyond Nintendo and the video game industry.  He has been involved with a number of philanthropic activities, including roles with the United Way of King County and the Boy Scouts of America (as Chief Seattle Council), as well as the Western Washington University (as a trustee).<br />
<br />
<div class="header">The Early Years</div><br />
Howard Lincoln was born on February 14, 1940 in Oakland, California.  His family had strong ties to the area, due to his father's role as an executive with the Pullman Company, which manufactured railroad cars.<br />
<br />
By 1957, Lincoln commenced tertiary studies at the University of California, Berkeley.  While at university, Lincoln found himself moving to law as his chosen career.  He successfully gained admission to Boalt Hall in 1962 (and graduated in the same class as Rose Bird, who later became a chief justice of the California Supreme Court).<br />
<br />
During this period, the draft for the Vietnam War was in place.  And, sure enough, Lincoln was called to report for a physical only three days after passing the bar exam.  Before he was due to commence service, Lincoln began working for the Alameda County district attorney, Frank Coakley (this was a short-term role and was his first directly after leaving university).<br />
<br />
In 1966, Lincoln began his service with the navy as a judge advocate.  He learned about military adjudication in an officers' training course at Newport, Rhode Island.  When given the option to serve in either New York City or Seattle, Lincoln chose the latter.<br />
<br />
Lincoln was stationed at the Sand Point Naval Air Station where he tried court-marshal cases.  It was during this time that he met a striking young woman named Grace, a former schoolteacher from Kansas, who had decided to join the navy largely out of boredom.  She served a tour of duty in a photographic intelligence unit and was later sent to Seattle, where she met Howard.  The pair married only six months after meeting.<br />
<br />
Unlike Howard, Grace Lincoln faced the full brunt of anti-war protests; she faced both physical and verbal abuse at the hands of protesters and as a result, she was highly relieved when her tour of duty ended.  Howard followed Grace into civilian life in 1970, when the couple settled down and began looking for civilian jobs.<br />
<br />
Although they had the option to move back to California, the Lincolns decided to remain in Seattle.  Howard submitted his resume to all of the city's top law firms and was eventually hired by Sax and MacIver, where he specialized in banking and corporate law (and where he also built a sizable business).<br />
<br />
<div class="header">Judy, Stone and Lincoln</div><br />
Ron Judy and Al Stone were among the most important figures in Nintendo's first big push into North America.  The two men had run their own distribution business in the United States called Chase Express, which consisted of a fleet that transported shipping containers from Seattle's piers.<br />
<br />
It was not long before Chase Express dived into the video game industry (thanks to a tip from a friend in Hawaii, oddly enough).  The company's first game was called <i>Space Fever</i>.  It was an arcade game made by none other than Nintendo - the friend in Hawaii had insisted that this product was taking Japan by storm.  It seemed that Americans enjoyed these new arcade games, too; in Ron Judy's own words, the early games were making "obscene profits".<br />
<br />
Chase Express soon transformed into Far East Video; Ron Judy and Al Stone had decided to jump into the video game business exclusively.  And in the process, they noticed that Nintendo did not have a distributor in the United States mainland; rather, a trading company in Hawaii was purchasing the units from Japan and needed another buyer to sell them across the remainder of the country.<br />
<br />
Shortly after Judy and Stone began selling Nintendo games independently, they were summoned to a meeting at Nintendo of America's new Manhattan office.  Minoru Arakawa (NoA's president) and Hiroshi Yamauchi (Nintendo Co., Ltd.'s president) were both present, although Arakawa did all the talking.<br />
<br />
Arakawa informed Judy and Stone that he intended for Nintendo of America to directly import NCL's games to the United States; in return, Judy and Stone would be able to continue distributing Nintendo products within America.  Moreover, their business would remain independent and Nintendo would cover their expenses.  Judy and Stone were given a contract to sign that would formalize the arrangement, which they handed to their CPA (who handled their books at the time) to examine.  <br />
<br />
Their CPA, as it turned out, knew a lawyer by the name of Howard Lincoln.  The contract, which confirmed Judy and Stone's position as sole U.S. distributors for Nintendo's coin-operated games, was given to Lincoln so that he might provide further legal advice on its contents.  Upon reading over the contract, Lincoln told Judy and Stone that it was "completely screwy".  He helped them to fix its terms prior to the establishment of Nintendo's new New York-based distribution network.
