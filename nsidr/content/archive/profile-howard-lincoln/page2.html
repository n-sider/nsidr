<div class="header">Donkey Kong Syndrome</div><br />
Minoru Arakawa was becoming increasingly desperate for a hit product.  Yamauchi had told him that all of NCL's engineers were busy on other projects and that, in the grand scheme of things, America was still insignificant to NCL.  All he could do was appoint a new apprentice to the project - a young man named Shigeru Miyamoto, who knew nothing about games.  Arakawa was upset, but had no choice.<br />
<br />
<i>Donkey Kong</i> had initially received a lukewarm reception at Nintendo of America's offices when a sample unit finally arrived.  It was considered too odd, with a confusing and nonsensical name.  Al Stone simply said "it's over."<br />
<br />
Of course, the reality couldn't have been further removed from Al Stone's initial proclamation; people began lining up to play Miyamoto's first game.  Nintendo of America ordered two thousand units and the gamble paid off; every single unit sold.  Eventually, NoA's staff were assembling up to 250 machines per day.  And, by the end of NoA's second year, the company had achieved sales of $100 million.<br />
<br />
Judy and Stone's corporations (Ron Judy Inc. and Al Stone Inc., which Lincoln had set up) closed their first fiscal year, with each having made over $1 million.<br />
<br />
The success of <i>Donkey Kong</i> produced two direct effects; firstly, it established Nintendo as a major player within the American market (where previously it had been largely disregarded by its competitors).  And secondly, Nintendo's three major competitors wanted a share of the <i>Donkey Kong</i> pie.<br />
<br />
Atari, Mattel and Coleco each wanted the exclusive rights to <i>Donkey Kong</i> for their home game consoles (as it was an arcade-exclusive title at this point).  Coleco contacted Yamauchi directly and Yamauchi decided that Nintendo should work with them; Coleco were, as he put it, "the hungriest company" with the most at stake.<br />
<br />
Before the rights to <i>Donkey Kong</i> could be sold, however, the name needed to be trademarked and the game content needed to be protected through copyright.  Lincoln had never done this before, but had simply told Arakawa "no problem" (he later pointed out that lawyers should never tell their clients when they don't know what they are doing).<br />
<br />
Lincoln then assisted Nintendo to put together a contract between itself and Coleco.  It was a contract that heavily favored Nintendo; Coleco was to assume all risk.  Nevertheless, the money poured in as a result of the agreement.<br />
<br />
At this time, Nintendo had become Howard Lincoln's primary source of work.  He drew up a new contract between Judy, Stone and Nintendo, whereby Judy and Stone would become vice-president of marketing and vice-president of sales respectively.<br />
<br />
Also, Lincoln aggressively pursued counterfeiters, for whom the <i>Donkey Kong</i> phenomenon had become a veritable gold mine.  Nintendo worked closely with U.S. marshals across the country, where raids were regularly performed and counterfeit goods seized.  Despite Nintendo's heavy litigation and its prosecution of thirty-five companies and individuals, it is estimated that at least $100 million was lost due to piracy.<br />
<br />
It was during this period that Howard Lincoln became great friends with Minoru Arakawa.  The two men, accompanied by their wives, regularly went to dinner together.  Discussion almost inevitably turned to work matters on most occasions.<br />
<br />
<div class="header">Universal versus Nintendo</div><br />
During the 1980's, there were three major players in the American video game industry: Atari, Coleco and Mattel.  And, as the industry grew rapidly, large companies in other entertainment industries wanted to get in on the video game action.<br />
<br />
One such company was MCA Universal, the massive entertainment conglomerate that had so far missed the boat on the emerging game industry.  And the company's president, Sid Sheinberg, wanted in.  <br />
<br />
The success of <i>Donkey Kong</i> had caught everyone's attention, including MCA Universal.  Sheinberg directed an MCA attorney, Bob Hadl, to investigate the new juggernaut.  When Hadl returned, he explained that multiple elements of <i>Donkey Kong</i> infringed on MCA's rights to the characters and scenario of <i>King Kong</i>.  At the same time, Hadl explained the relationship between Coleco and Nintendo vis-a-vis their licensing arrangement.<br />
<br />
Sid Sheinberg's strategy was to place a wedge between Nintendo and Coleco.  For Nintendo, <i>Donkey Kong</i> was critical.  And Coleco had bet the farm on the success of the game; their ColecoVision console was largely centered around that one title.<br />
<br />
Sheinberg called a meeting with Coleco executives prior to communicating with Nintendo.  He applied a simple carrot-and-stick approach, whereby he pointed out the alleged copyright violation (and threatened to go after Coleco as a result).  He also dangled the proverbial carrot in front of the Coleco executives' faces; there was the promise of a potential MCA investment in their company, should they agree to cooperate.<br />
<br />
Nintendo's Kyoto headquarters received a message from Sheinberg shortly afterwards, which insisted that they had forty-eight hours to turn over all <i>Donkey Kong</i> profits and that all unsold copies of the game should be destroyed.  The sheer size and aggressive nature of MCA made the threat highly serious, especially given the relatively tenuous nature of Nintendo's operations in America (they were, after all, largely reliant on <i>Donkey Kong</i>).<br />
<br />
When Lincoln and Arakawa met with MCA executives, Lincoln simply told them that if Nintendo had indeed infringed on their rights to <i>King Kong</i>, he would be happy to settle.  That was, of course, if MCA Universal could prove their ownership of <i>King Kong</i>.  MCA executives were incensed and reiterated their original threat, with an added footnote: they explained that they would go after royalties, inventory, damages and more.<br />
<br />
Although Lincoln suspected that Nintendo may have to settle (between $5 and $7 million in his estimation), he insisted that more time was needed.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Lincoln suspected Coleco of behaving improperly, largely due to their continual insistence that settlement was the only option.  Moreover, Coleco executives had agreed to a subsequent private meeting with MCA (this was done in front of the Nintendo representatives, during the three-way meeting at MCA's headquarters).<br />
<br />
Bob Hadl agreed to send Nintendo a chain of title relating to MCA's ownership of the <i>King Kong</i> trademark.  Over the next month, Nintendo did not receive this and when MCA were further questioned, they simply repeated their demand for royalties.<br />
<br />
At a later meeting between Arakawa, Lincoln and Sheinberg, Sheinberg commented that he was pleased Nintendo had agreed to settle.  MCA had promised that there might be further opportunities for the two companies to work together, once a settlement had been reached.<br />
<br />
Sheinberg, however, was in for a rude awakening.  After their casual, polite dinner, Lincoln flatly told Sheinberg that Nintendo would not settle.  He told Sheinberg that he believed there had been no infringement and that, simply, he had wanted to deliver this message directly to Sheinberg face-to-face.<br />
<br />
MCA Universal sued Nintendo on June 29, 1982; they simultaneously announced that they planned to license the rights to <i>King Kong</i> to Coleco (thus bearing out Howard Lincoln's earlier suspicions of the company circumventing Nintendo and dealing with MCA Universal directly).<br />
<br />
Nintendo was not the only company in Sheinberg's sights, however.  There were multiple licensees who were making use of the <i>Donkey Kong</i> trademark; MCA Universal sent cease-and-desist letters to each of these companies.  Each company was provided with three options: they could simply stop using the <i>Donkey Kong</i> characters, obtain a license from Universal or be sued.  Of all of Nintendo's licensees, six gave in to MCA Universal's demands; only Milton Bradley refused.  Ralston Purina offered $5,000 for the use of the characters on their breakfast cereals (the offer was seen as an insult by Sheinberg, who rejected it).  At that point, Ralston Purina refused any further settlement.<br />
<br />
Prior to the trial, Nintendo executives met at NCL headquarters in Kyoto where they discussed strategy.  Several conclusions were reached early on.  In particular, Lincoln had instinctively felt that MCA Universal did not own <i>King Kong</i>.  After all, previous litigation seemed to indicate that the name was within the public domain.  In fact, MCA itself had based previous litigation on the idea that <i>King Kong</i> could not be trademarked for this very reason.  Nintendo executives felt that Lincoln's instincts were probably correct.<br />
<br />
While Nintendo continued to prepare for the upcoming trial, Arakawa wondered if Lincoln would consider joining Nintendo as an employee; he was becoming incredibly close to Lincoln, whom he respected personally and professionally.<br />
<br />
When Arakawa finally proposed the idea, Lincoln said that he would have to think about it.  He also mentioned that if he were to take on a role at Nintendo, his involvement should be at a senior level within the business; not just as a general counsel.  This was exactly what Arakawa had in mind.  Shortly afterward, Lincoln accepted Arakawa's proposal and became senior vice-president at the company.  <br />
<br />
The trial lasted seven days and Nintendo was represented by John Kirby, who had previously won major cases for companies such as PepsiCo, General Foods and Warner-Lambert.<br />
<br />
Kirby proved beyond any doubt that he was earning every dollar Nintendo paid for his service.  He attacked MCA Universal's claim on several fronts:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Nintendo physically demonstrated <i>Donkey Kong</i> in the court room, in an effort to illustrate that it was different than <i>King Kong</i>;</li>
  <li>Shigeru Miyamoto, who was deposed in Kyoto, recounted how he had come up with the idea in the first place.  He had initially called the character "King Kong" because this term was a generic term for any menacing ape in Japanese;</li>
  <li>Kirby provided testimony and judgments from past trials whereby MCA's ownership of <i>King Kong</i> had been brought into question.  He asserted that MCA knew it did not own the rights to <i>King Kong</i> and sued Nintendo in full knowledge of this fact.</li>
  </ul><br />
At the completion of the trial, the judge dismissed MCA's lawsuit completely.  He scolded MCA for bringing the suit forward despite knowing that it did not own <i>King Kong</i>.  He also pointed out that even if MCA did own <i>King Kong</i>, the trademark would not have been infringed upon because <i>Donkey Kong</i> was sufficiently different.<br />
<br />
MCA appealed the case all the way up to the Supreme Court and was rejected at every step.  Nintendo was finally awarded $1.8 million in damages, at the conclusion of legal proceedings.<br />
<br />
Kirby was richly rewarded by Nintendo.  Kirby, his wife and associates were taken to dinner at an expensive Manhattan restaurant.  He was also provided with a framed photograph of a thirty-thousand-dollar, twenty-seven-foot sailboat that Nintendo had purchased for him as a gift.  The boat was christened <i>Donkey Kong</i> and came with the worldwide rights to use the name for sailboats.<br />
<br />
The case represented a major lesson for Nintendo.  Lincoln later revealed that Nintendo now felt confident that it could stand on its own two feet in the American market; that it could compete with even the largest corporations.
