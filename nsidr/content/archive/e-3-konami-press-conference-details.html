<p><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/e3/e3story.html?sid=6149847">GameSpot</a> sat patiently through Konami's press conference this evening.  One Wii title and several Nintendo DS games were discussed during the event.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Elebits (Wii) - A completely new franchise with a "fanciful art style."  There are three concepts behind the game.  One is to make the player feel he or she is within the game world.  The second is to enable players to move and lift objects.  The third is to create a new character property. The game will be on display at Nintendo's E3 booth tomorrow.<br><br>

<li>Lunar Knights (NDS) - From Kojima Productions, Lunar Knights follows a similar style to the light-sensing Boktai series.  You battle space vampires and use the DS stylus to perform special attacks.  There is also 3d space-shooter gameplay and a "digital weather gameplay mechanic."

<p>Finally there was the reiteration of Death Jr. and the Science Fair and one additional Nintendo DS game coming to Nintendo DS.  The unnamed title will feature Marvel characters with online gameplay consisting of card-battles.  Stay tuned for more info.</p>
