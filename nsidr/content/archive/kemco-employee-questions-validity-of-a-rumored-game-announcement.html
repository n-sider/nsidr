<p>It has been reported by several websites that Kemco is in development with an exclusive title called <i>Bloody Moon</i> for GameCube and that the title would be officially unveiled at E3 2004.</p>

<p>N-Sider has learned from a Kemco employee who posts under the name of Adoug on the company's North American website, that this news may very well be false.</p>

<p>"Unless the director of product development and I are both missing something (which I HIGHLY DOUBT) this is not happening," he said.  "So, not sure where you are getting this but I would be skeptical of the source.  Also, any games that are coming out by Kemco will be announced here, by myself or my co-workers. So, check back soon for games to be announced."</p>
