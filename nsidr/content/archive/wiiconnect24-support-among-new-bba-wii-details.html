The game will feature 15 brain-building activities in five categories: Identify, Memorize, Analyze, Compute and Visualize. All activities are focused on the Wii remote's pointer capabilities, and can be enjoyed alone or with friends.<br />
<br />
Three multiplayer modes are featured. Mental Marathon is a speed test, where players take turns going as fast as possible to buy more time. Mind Sprint pits two teams against each other, and the first to complete a set of problems wins. Finally, there is also the game-show-styled Brain Quiz, with five extra activities.<br />
<br />
Players will import their Miis to represent themselves, much like in <i>Wii Sports</i>. Miis roam the school hallways and pop up on the screen to show whose turn is next in multiplayer. While the game unfortunately does not feature online play, it does utilize WiiConnect24. Players can trade student data, which comes with a Mii attached, to compare test scores and to compete against a computer-controlled opponent using a friend's data. Received Miis will roam the school halls along with your own.<br />
<br />
It is unknown at this time whether BBA will utilize the message board system to send data. Other outlets are assuming that the system's friend code is bring imported into the game with Miis, but it should be made clear that BBA appears to be using the system's WiiConnect24 functionality, and is not a full Wi-Fi Connection online title like <i>Pok√©mon Battle Revolution</i> or <i>Mario Strikers Charged</i>.<br />
<br />
Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree is set to release June 11, 2007.  Be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=3984&view=screens">new screenshots</a> we have of the title.
