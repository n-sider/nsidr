<p>Some new details have emerged regarding <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</i>, the newly announced GBA title being developed by Capcom. The most obvious and important is the Minish Cap, which is a small talking magical hat that Link wears. The cap causes Link to shrink at key points in the game. Allowing him to access areas previously unavailable. The camera angle varies when Link shrinks. Being of either a standard view of the world with Link being a tiny dot on the screen or a magnified view of the tiny Link and his surroundings.</p>

<p>The dungeon on display has pretty much all the the typical Zelda puzzles and an interesting new item. A bottle that can suck in air and then expel it in a powerful burst, allowing Link to shove enemies and items around as well as uncover things hidden under debris on covering the ground. The bottles vacuum effect can also be used to move objects around to help unlock certain puzzles.</p>

<p>Another thing revealed by the Demo is that Link collects Kinstones. Which are broken magic stones. Because the stones are broken Link has to find the missing half. When combined the Kinstones have unpredictable effects from giving Link Rupees to calling game characters to give Link information. Some even open up new areas for Link to access.</p>
