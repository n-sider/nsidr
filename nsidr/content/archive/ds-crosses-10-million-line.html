<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8ETFI580.htm">Nintendo Co, Ltd. has announced</a> that the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> has sold 10 million units worldwide.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a>, VP of Marketing at NOA, said the DS has sold 3 million in North America this year so far, though holiday sales numbers are not yet available.</p>

<p>Separately, Nintendo also tossed out some more handheld-related numbers: <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874">Mario Kart DS</a> has topped 1 million U.S. sales in the seven weeks since its release.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967">Nintendogs</a> has passed the 1.5 million mark since its August release.  DS launch title <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=878">Super Mario 64 DS</a> has sold 1.3 million units.</p>

<p>Over in Japan, Nintendogs, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a>, Brain Age, and Brain Flex have all passed the 1 million sales mark.  Mario Kart DS and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=879">Wario Ware: Touched!</a> are nearing that same mark.</p>

<p>Finally, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection has also been enjoying considerable success.  Worldwide, over 10 million connections to the service have been logged since it went live seven weeks ago with the release of Mario Kart DS, and it has played host to 550,000 unique users during that time.  All of this adds up to a pretty impressive year for Nintendo's dual-screen wonder in 2005; we'll have to see what 2006 brings.</p>
