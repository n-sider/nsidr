<p><h2>Volume 4</h2></center>

<p>Welcome back to the Rumor Mill along with a new N-Sider! After great consideration, it has been decided to make the Rumor Mill a monthly feature instead of the bi-weekly feature we had intended it to be. Readers can now expect a new edition on the first Friday of every month. 

<p> Now, for those unfamiliar with the Rumor Mill, let me explain exactly how it works. This page, which is the main page, is known as The Mill. This is the place where you can read about the latest rumors and speculation on Nintendo and its products. At the very top, you will see any and all-new updates for the month that relate to rumors discussed in pervious editions. Below the updates, you will find the newest rumors.  The second part, which is linked at the bottom, is known as the The Storage Room. The Storage Room is where you can locate any past rumors discussed in the Rumor Mill feature for quick access and to view a rumors current status. The Storage Room is designed to help readers determine credible sources of industry rumors, so that you can determine what rumors from which news organizations are likely to be true. The final segment of the Rumor Mill is The Pre-Mill. The Pre-Mill is the place to go for an insightful history lesson on some of the most well known rumors ever to grace the web about Nintendo. Everything from the MEGATON to Rare jumps ship is covered in here. 

<p>Now lets get mill turning!

<p><center><h3><b><a name="noname1"><font color="405CC6">N5 backward compatible? DS connectivity?</center></h3></b></a></font>

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> Famitsu
<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> December 12, 2003
<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Likely

<p>Even with next-generation hardware still a good two years away, that isnt stopping anyone from speculating as to what, may or may not be included with them. Reports about the Xbox 2 and PS3 have been plentiful for some time now, but Nintendo, as they were with the GameCube, has been mum on the N5. Other than the fact that Nintendo is working on it, there is no other confirmed information. Heck, even the code-name, N5, is just a name created by fans! 

<p>As far as rumors go, there are several high profile features that have been discussed lately. One of the biggest has to be the inclusion of backward compatibility with GameCube games. Sony has already gone on the record to say that PS3 will be compatible with PS2 titles, thought it is rumored that PSone games wont be supported, and Microsoft has hinted that they intend to allow for backwards compatibility as well.

<p><a href=http://www.gamecubeland.com/index.php?page=news&news_id=2009>On December 25, 2003</a>, Famitsu ran an interview with Satoru Iwata, in which he stated that the next-generation of hardware will be backwards compatible with current software. 
<p><I>"It will be able to use the games already created in the previous generation. And it is something that will work. Side performances and graphics, one-day reach a kind of limit with a quality, which is already close to realism, and it will be difficult to still do much better. The role of Nintendo is thus to study other ways in order to improve the experience of the player."</I>  Satoru Iwata, Famitsu (December 2003)
<p>As exciting as this information is, it should be taken with a bit of skepticism, and I say this for two reasons. First, it has been reported that Nintendo is still considering whether or not they should include Game Boy connectivity with the <I>Nintendo DS</I>. This is important to note because it shows that Nintendo still isnt 100% decided on the final specs of a piece of hardware that is going to be released in a relatively short period of time. Second, Nintendo is debating if the DS will even make it out this year, mainly do to the state of the LCD market. This shows that Nintendo is very price conscious, and that they are will to do what is necessary to get the best price possible, perhaps even excluding a technology that would allow for GameCube support.
<p>Another popular rumor about the N5 is the ability to link to the DS. Nintendo made it clear back when the mystery hardware was announced last year that it would be a third pillar along side both the Game Boy and N5. 
<p><I>"It should be a hint to the next generation of hardware. This will be the year that we put up a serious fight with this new product."</I> - Satoru Iwata, Mainichi Shimbun (January 2004)
<p>The quote above by Iwata is screaming with interest. We know that the DS uses some sort of wireless network; could this be the way the two systems interact? Personally, I have always felt it would be a good idea to make the GBA 2 into the N5 controller, or to be able to fully substitute it for a N5 controller. This would be a large step forward from the current GBA-to-GCN connection. With the knowledge that the DS is using duel-screens, I think this could be hinting at the possibility that Nintendo is thinking along the same lines. The TV would remain the primary device for view games, but Nintendo may opt to use an inexpensive black and white LCD (similar to those found on cell phones and PDAs) on the controller for game stats. This, of course, is just wild speculation at this point.

<p><center><h3><b><a name="noname1"><font color="405CC6">New Zelda games at E3?</center></h3></b></a></font>

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> EGM (Fed. 2004, Page 100)
<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> January 3, 2004
<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Likely
<p>It has been known for sometime now that a new Zelda game has been in development for the Game Boy. On <a href="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/387/387029p1.html">February 24, 2003</a>, Miyamoto confirmed in an interview with Dutch videogame journalists that Capcom was hard at work with a brand new Zelda title for the Game Boy Advance. The same team behind the Oracle games for the Game Boy Color is handling this game. Development began sometime in 2001, but was temporarily shelved in order to complete <I>Four Swords</I> in the <I>Link to the Past</I> port for the GBA. Currently, there is no known release date for the unnamed title, but according the EGM (Feb. 2004, Pg. 100) it will be shown at E3 2004.

<p>Another Zelda game is also in development over at EAD for the Game Cube that uses the same cel-shading engine as <I>Wind Waker</I>. This game was announced shortly after the American release of Links first Cube adventure and development started shortly before that. It has been reported by EGM that this title will also make an appearance at E3. It is unknown if either of these games will interact with each other, but considering Nintendos commitment to connectivity and the close proximity of the rumored Q4 release dates, it is likely that both will connect in some way to open up similar to feature present in Wind Waker.

<p>All in all, gamers will have a very Zelda filled year with <I>Four Swords</I> also coming out in March!

<p><center><h3><b><a name="noname1"><font color="405CC6">No more Madden for GameCube?</center></h3></b></a></font>

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> N-Philes
<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> February 1, 2004
<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Unknown

<p>If there is one thing that Nintendo fans are more familiar with than anyone else, it would have to be delays and cancellations from third parties. In this case, it appears that Electronic Arts may be pulling the Madden franchise from the GameCube. 

<p>On <a href="http://www.n-philes.com/php/epzvyeyyvulefpulyzl.php">February 1, 2004</a>, N-Philes ran a story that stated that GameStop.com was currently talking pre-orders for Madden 2005 for all major platforms, including GBA, except for the GameCube. EA has yet to make any statements in regards to this news, so this is completely speculation at this point. Could this be a hint at the removal of the franchise completely from the system? Game Stop and Electronic Boutiques websites have been valuable sources in determining release dates in the past, Ebgames.com was the first site to confirm that <I>Pikmin 2</I> and <I>Twin Snakes</I> had been delayed, so a certain degree of credibility exists here. 

<p>Such a move wouldnt be that unexpected, especially when you take into account that Sega dropped their sports lineup for the GameCube back in <a href= http://cube.ign.com/articles/385/385399p1.html>February 2003</a>. Sports games have never done well on Nintendos console compared to competitors. Such a move would leave Nintendo seriously lacking a powerful football title for the remainder of the Cubes lifetime. Obviously, this is a serious problem

<p>On <a href=http://cube.ign.com/articles/425/425457p1.html?fromint=1>June 23, 2003</a>, Acclaims CEO, Rod Cousen, announced that his company would cease all major GameCube development in the future do to poor sales of its games on the platform. Support does continue today; however, all titles are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if they are worth porting to the system. 

<p><I>"Why should we develop games for formats that don't generate comparable returns?" We are still supporting PS2 and Xbox, but Nintendo? No, not in the near future."</I>  Rob Cousen, CEO of Acclaim 

<p>On <a href=http://www.vgln.com/cube/10629609887529.shtml>September 7, 2003</a>, Eidos revealed their plans to terminate all support for Nintendos console. As big as a blow as this seems, it should be noted that Eidos only published five mediocre times for the system in two years, including TimeSplitters 2. Fortunately for us, EA has picked-up the publishing rights for both TimeSplitters 3 (formerly published by Eidos) and Burnout 3 (formerly published by Acclaim). As of right now, both of those titles will make it to the GameCube for now.
<p><I>The GameCube is a declining business. If other companies follow us they [Nintendo] will have a hard battle to fight.</I> - Mark McGarvey, Eidos Interactive Chief Executive
