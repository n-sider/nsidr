Famitsu <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2007/07/10/103,1184055903,74915,0,0.html">revealed</a> today that a new game in the Trauma Center series, titled <i>Trauma Center: New Blood</i>, will be shown at E3. The series began on the DS with <i>Trauma Center: Under the Knife</i>, but the Wii remake, Second Opinion, fared better in retail. New Blood will follow the money on Wii.<br />
<br />
The revelation also comes with some screenshots, amazing character artwork, and a few juicy details. New Blood features a brand new 2-player co-op mode, online rankings, will display in 16:9.<br />
<br />
Nothing else was revealed, but expect to see more of New Blood at E3, which begins tomorrow.
