<p>The Next Level has posted a new interview with Shigeru Miyamoto. Here is a quote to wet your appetite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>TNL:</b><i> How far along is the new Zelda and how long has it been in development?</i></p>

<p><b>Miyamoto:</b><i> The plan is to definitely have a version that you will be able to play to your heart's content by E3 next year. Everything that you saw in the [trailer] is running in real-time, playable with the engine, and so at this point we've got the engine running and everything's working and it's a question of going in and putting in the finishing pieces.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like all Miyamoto interviews, this one comes as a highly recommended read.</p>
