<p>Konami announced the development of Lost in Blue 2 for the Nintendo DS, a sequel to the survival adventure game released in September 2005.  Lost in Blue 2 is scheduled for a European release in early 2007.</p>

<p>Konami will build off the basics built into the first Lost in Blue, a present-day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a> tale of being stranded on an island.  The game unfolds in a similar storyline as the first where a young man and woman are washed ashore a deserted island.  The two of you must work together to survive and eventually escape.  Players will gather food, new weapons, new items and explore the island using the Nintendo DS stylus.</p>
