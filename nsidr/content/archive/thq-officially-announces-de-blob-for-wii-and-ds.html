Revealed just under a week ago in a German magazine, THQ is officially announcing today that they will bring <i>de Blob</i> to Wii&mdash;but the real news is that they'll be bringing a version to Nintendo DS as well.<br />
<br />
Originally concieved by nine students of game design at Utretch University, the goal in de Blob is to splatter the landscapes and citizens with color.  The Wii version will be controlled by "swing[s] of the Wii Remote"; the DS version, by "flick[s] of the DS Stylus"; both sending the title character ricocheting and swinging through the city spreading color.<br />
<br />
THQ will be showing de Blob at E3 next week.  The title is expected to launch in early 2008.
