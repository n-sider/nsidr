<p>The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection official <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/global/index.jsp">website</a> is counting down to its one millionth unique user.  As of this news posting that number stands at a little over 998,600 players.  It's only a matter of weeks before the service hits this landmark.  Those almost one million players have made over 26 million connections with Wi-Fi compatible games such as <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/AnimalCrossingGamingHub.jsp">Animal Crossing Wild World</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/MarioKartGamingHub.jsp">Mario Kart DS</a>, and <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/TonyHawkGamingHub.jsp">Tony Hawk's American Sk8land</a>.  The Wi-Fi Connection service launched with the release of Mario Kart on November 14, 2005.</p>

<p>The next Wi-Fi compatible titles, <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/TetrisDSGamingHub.jsp">Tetris DS</a> and <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/MetroidHuntersGamingHub.jsp">Metroid Prime Hunters</a>, will be hitting the Nintendo DS on March 20.  In addition, <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/LostMagicDSGamingHub.jsp">Lost Magic</a> is scheduled for release in April.  Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> will also utilize the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service when it launches later this year with titles such as Super Smash Bros and Metroid Prime 3.</p>
