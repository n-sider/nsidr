<p>In an article posted by <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/703/703515p1.html">IGN</a>, yesterday, several games were cited from the latest issue of <i>Famitsu</i>, some of which are scheduled to appear at E3. From the article:</p>

<blockquote>"Ubisoft's list of titles includes some big next generation offerings. PS3 will see Assassin and Game V. Xbox 360 will see BIA Hell's Highway, Rainbow Six Vegas and Splinter Cell Double Agent. PS2 and Xbox 360 will see Open Season. <b>Dark Messiah and Red Steel are listed as hardware TBA</b>. Playable/video status of the Ubisoft titles is not listed in the magazine."</blockquote>

<p>Could Ubisoft <a
href="http://www.mightandmagic.com/us/darkmessiah/teaser/">have the answer</a> to Epic Games' <i>Oblivion</i>? Wii's control setup seems perfectly suited for the title. Time will tell -- only 10 days left until <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1915">the big show</a>. Stay tuned to N-Sider for more info as it breaks.</p>
