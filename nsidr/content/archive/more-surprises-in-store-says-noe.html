<a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/news/article.do?elementId=kKOqfxknfVLDOdO9hy-Ft4mFndtGPRum">Nintendo of Europe</a> has updated its website acknowledging what Nintendo fans have to look forward to in 2006.  In addition to a full array of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=11">Nintendo GameCube</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a> software, the company says there is much to look forward to in regards to its next-generation Project <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> hardware.<br><br>

"On an as-yet-unannounced date in 2006 Nintendo will launch its next home console, code-named 'Revolution' - which will truly spark a revolution in gaming. We've already been given a sneak peek at its potential with the revelation of the groundbreaking one-handed controller with motion-sensitive technology. We already know that Revolution will let you play all your Nintendo GameCube titles and also a back catalogue of downloadable Nintendo classics. But if you think that's all there is to know about Revolution, think again... 2006 is going to be very interesting indeed."

Finally, NoE lists <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> as a GameCube title for a "to be announced" date in 2006.  It's rumored the title will debut for the Nintendo GameCube alongside the release of Project Revolution for those who wish to utilize its unique control method and as an incentive for early adopters of the console.
