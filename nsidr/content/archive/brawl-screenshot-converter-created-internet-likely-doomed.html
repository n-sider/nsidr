<i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> isn't out just yet in the West; but it's been in Japan for several weeks now.  An enterprising fan has been hard at work trying to figure out how to share in-game screenshots on the Internet, as we found out via <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/">4 color rebellion</a> this morning.<br />
<br />
The result is a unimaginatively named tool called bin2jpg.  Its sole purpose is to take the .bin files off SD cards and transform them into Internet-digestible JPEG images, so you can show them off<br />
<br />
The net impact on the Internet has yet to be determined, but judging by some of the <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3156-1.jpg">early efforts</a>, it's probably going to be disastrous.  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/95587164/bin2jpg.zip.html">Download it</a> if you must.<br />
