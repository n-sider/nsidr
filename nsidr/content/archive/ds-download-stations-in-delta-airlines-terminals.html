<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3201-1.jpg" width="220" height="262" class="image_styled" /></div>Nintendo has announced, in partnership with Delta Airlines, the installation of DS Download Stations in three U.S. airports.<br />
<br />
The stations, which&mdash;like any other DS Download Station&mdash;wirelessly offer downloadable demos to Nintendo DS owners, are installed at JFK, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, and Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky are available in Delta terminals.  Games available at the download stations currently include <i>Brain Age</i>, <i>Elite Beat Agents</i>, <i>Cooking Mama</i>, and <i>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend</i>.<br />

NOA senior VP of marketing and corporate communications George Harrison was predictably optimistic.  "Partnering with Delta builds on Nintendo's goal to expand the world of video games to new audiences," Harrison said.  "Because people typically have a lot of down time, airports are ideal places for people young and old to try out free new game experiences and see what they like."
