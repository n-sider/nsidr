<p>Recent word (<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1804">some even credible</a>) had an entry in the Trauma Center series effectively confirmed for Nintendo's Revolution as well as a 2007 release date for an entry in the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series.</p>

<p>However, it seems that since then, <a href="http://www.revolutionfanboy.com/2006/03/06/atlus-denies-revo-trauma-center-for-now/">Atlus has denied</a> Trauma Center is in the works for Revolution, and <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=63131">likewise Square-Enix</a> with Crystal Chronicles' rumored release date.  Time will tell whether and when we will see these franchises come to Revolution, but for right now, neither company is saying.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> An earlier version of this story
read as if Crystal Chronicles for Revolution had no confirmation at all, when in fact it was announced for the platform last May.  I apologize for the confusion.</p>
