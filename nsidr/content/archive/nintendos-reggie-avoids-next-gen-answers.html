The following step-around answer just about sums it up.  When asked if there were any features not yet announced for the Revolution console/controller, Reggie responded:<br><br>

"As much as I think Iwata likes me, if I shared that with you I probably wouldn't be here. [Laughs] You know, here are the facts: Come [this May], we'll disclose a lot more. After [that], we'll disclose even more, and right about the time of the launch, we'll disclose even more. There are certainly elements to everything we're doing about Revolution I'm talking beyond the controller, the virtual console, all the different elements we'll be sharing all the way up to launch. And I believe as consumers understand the full range of benefits and the full functionality, the more and more they're going to get excited. I really do."<br><br>

Of curious note however is that Reggie makes mention that a third-party developer may have been or is currently in development with a web browser for the Nintendo DS.  Reggie explains, "My belief is that we thought a licensee was getting into that area, and once we heard that we backed off. If we end up seeing that nobodys really going to enter that space, it may be something that well go back and look at. I know that Mr. Iwata has talked about it."
