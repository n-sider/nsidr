<p>A spokesperson for Nintendo Europe reaffirmed to GamesIndustry.biz today <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=17916">their intent to continue selling</a> the classic <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> model as long as there is demand, even in the face of today's launch of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> in that territory with their <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2182">exclusive black color choice</a>.</p>

<p>The statement is in marked contrast to Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</a>'s comments <a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/02/20/nintendo_ds_to_ds_lite/">comments  about dropping the classic DS</a>, made to the TV show Game Heads back in February&mdash;Reggie would like to see the classic DS phased off America's shelves by August or September, something that may prove to be no small feat considering Nintendo seems to have yet to set a lower retail price for the classic model, leaving it costing exactly the same as Lite.</p>

<p>Europe is the last territory to receive the Lite; Australia got theirs June 1, followed by America on June 11.  Japan has been enjoying Lite since March, where the redesigned system was nothing short of a runaway success.</p>
