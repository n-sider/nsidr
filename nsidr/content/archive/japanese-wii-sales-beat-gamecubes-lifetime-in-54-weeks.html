Based on Famitsu's Japan sales numbers, GAF's JoshuaJSlone has noted that Wii has now sold more units than GameCube had over its entire lifetime.<br />
<br />
The sales milestone for the sales week of December 3&#8212;54 weeks after launch&#8212;saw Wii hit 4,025,356 units sold, beating GameCube's launch total in that territory.  Wii got a boost that week to pull off 110k sales by Famitsu's reckoning, likely due to <i>Wii Fit</i>, which has gathered over 400k in sales since its launch December 1.<br />
