<p>Codemasters said it will publish Free Radical's <i>Second Sight</i> on GameCube.  The game is scheduled for release later this year.</p>

<p>Players will be able to shift objects and attack enemies in the game using the main character's telekinetic powers. In addition, Codemasters said the title will feature 13 weapons, including a sniper rifle and pistols.  The first tidbits of Second Sight's story have also been released.</p>

<blockquote><p><font size="2">Second Sight opens with John Vattic, the player-controlled lead character, as he awakens from a coma in a U.S. medical facility where he has been subjected to traumatic surgery and experimentation. He doesn't know his name, he can't remember his past, all he knows is that his only hope for survival is to escape and unravel the mystery that has led to his imprisonment.</p>

<p>Haunted by flashbacks, which are experienced as fully playable episodes within the game, and shocked by the discovery of his own psychic powers, the player takes Vattic on a search for his past and uncovers a fatal chain of events leading to a sinister conspiracy.</p>

<p>As Vattic explores his present and past, the game weaves between these two different time periods, which run through the game as a dual-narrative. The player-controlled actions of the past Vattic have consequences in the present  allowing a unique interaction between the player and the narrative of the game as Vattic's destiny is changed.</font></p></blockquote>
