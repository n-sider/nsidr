<p><a href="http://videogames.aol.com/insidethegame/countdown-to-e3">AOL Games</a> has made a list of its most anticipated games of E3.  Metroid Prime 3 for Wii ranks in at number five while The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess sneaks into the number two position.   AOL received the impression that Metroid Prime 3 is far along in development and further speculate it will be ready for the console's launch later this year.  "From the videos we've seen, it looks like it's almost done," said Libe Goad, senior editor of AOL Games.  "It just looks really far along."</p>

<p>  E3 kicks off on May 10, while Nintendo's press conference will occur the day prior on May 9.</p>
