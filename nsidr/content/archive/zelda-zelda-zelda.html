<p>Zelda fandom comes in many forms.  The above is artwork created by <a href="http://www.derekyu.com/?p=101">Derek Yu</a> showcasing a gritty, weathered Link making a last-stand against an army of moblins. Below is a video called Super Link Bros.  It applies several skins and items from the Legend of Zelda universe to the first level of Super Mario Bros.  Instead of Mario, players control Link who dashes through the environment stomping on octoroks and collecting hearts.  If you're interested in more fan works, check out a remake of the original Zelda for <a href="http://zeldamobile.gorthwogh.com/News.php">mobile phones</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo will release the latest in the The Legend of Zelda series later this year for Nintendo GameCube and Wii.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> was first unveiled at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo.  The realistic graphical style surprised many since they were expecting a sequel to the cel-shaded Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker.  This was the same show that introduced the ass-kicker and name-taker <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> to Nintendo fans.  Stay tuned for more from the Zelda universe.</p>
