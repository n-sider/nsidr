<p>Fearless leader <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=2">Cory Faller</a> has spotted a tidbit of knowledge on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection website's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a> FAQ.  The quote goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>In Animal Crossing: Wild World, you can set up a Friends Roster with anyone from around the world and then visit each other's town whenever you are both online. If your friend isn't online at the same time, you can send them a letter. You can even include a gift with the letter if you want.</p></blockquote>

<p>Until now, we've been going on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=17">Eguchi</a>'s word from an E3-era interview that stated the game would require you to visit a host town to send the host or other players living in that town a letter.  The apparent change of thought on Nintendo's part is highly welcome to Animal Crossing addicts everywhere -- after all, what's the point of sending a letter to someone if you're already visiting them?</p>
