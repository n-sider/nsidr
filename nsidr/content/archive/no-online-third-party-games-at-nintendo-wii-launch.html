<p>Stephanie Langlois, senior project coordinator for Ubisoft, has confirmed previous reports that Wii launch titles will lack online functionality.  Nintendo of Europe <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=116818">interviewed</a> Langlois about Ubisoft's launch title Red Steel and asked if it would feature an online mode.</p>

<p>Langlois explained, "...there will be four-player split screen, but no LAN. Online will maybe one day be announced by Nintendo but it won't be for the launch [of Red Steel]."</p>

<p>Activision, THQ, Midway, and Ubisoft have all indicated their launch titles will lack an online component.  <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/728/728041p1.html">IGN</a> also reports that multiple sources claim Wii Wi-Fi Connection libraries won't be available to third party developers until early 2007.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=822">E3 2005</a>, Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> said both the online component and a new Smash Bros. would accompany the console's launch.  It appears plans have changed significantly since then.</p>

<p>Even if it doesn't arrive on day one, Nintendo has big plans for its online venture.  The Wii will have built in Wi-Fi capabilities and a WiiConnect24 feature that places the system in sleep mode enabling it to stay permanently connected to the Internet.  This will assure that content is downloaded and shared even when the player is away.  Nintendo also plans to offer downloads on its Virtual Console of select retro titles previously released on NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, and TurboGrafx.  Extra content as well as new games are also planned for the Virtual Console service.  Nintendo remains mum on the rest but word has it we'll learn more shortly.</p>
