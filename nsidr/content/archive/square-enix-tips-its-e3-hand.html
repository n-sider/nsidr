<p>Square-Enix has taken the wraps off <a href="http://www.square-enix.co.jp/e306/">its E3 2006 website</a> and with it, titles they plan to show at the show.</p>

<p>For Nintendo DS, Square-Enix will be showing <cite>Children of Mana</cite>, <cite>Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime</cite>, and the fully-remade-in-3-D <cite>Final Fantasy III</cite> &mdash; all playable on the floor.  <cite>Children</cite> has already been out in Japan, releasing alongside the Nintendo DS lite there.  GameSpot has <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148222.html">tentative US releases</a> in 2006 for all three titles.</p>

<p>On Game Boy Advance, shown only in video form on the floor, we have <cite>Final Fantasy V Advance</cite> and <cite>Final Fantasy VI Advance</cite>.  Again, GameSpot is saying 2006 for both.</p>

<p>Of particular interest: no Nintendo Revolution titles are shown here.  Rumor has it that Nintendo is keeping tight reins on all Revolution titles and will show them all in its own booth at the show.  If that's the case, we'll see what they have to offer when we get there for our own E3 coverage, and we'll let you know as soon as we do.</p>
