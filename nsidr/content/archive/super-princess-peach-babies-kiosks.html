<p>Japanese resident Vinnk of <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/">4 color rebellion</a> has done <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2005/10/18/gaming-kiosks-in-my-hometown/">a little writeup on advertising kiosks</a> for upcoming-in-Japan titles Super Princess Peach and the sequel to Feel the Magic: XY&hearts;XX: Where Do Babies Come From?</p>

<p>Neither title has yet been announced for release outside Japan, but even if they do cross the ocean, they certainly won't come with advertising like this.</p>
