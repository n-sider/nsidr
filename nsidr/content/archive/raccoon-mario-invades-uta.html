<p>This week, the students at The University of Texas in Arlington were greeted by a surprise visit from a famed Nintendo icon: Mario!

<p>It is unknown as to who drew this image, but it sure looks cool. The image was found painted on the North wall of Pickard Hall. I guess someone really likes Super Mario Bros. 3, huh?

<p>N-Sider will be sure to let everyone know if anymore Nintendo icons appear on the university walls in the future.
