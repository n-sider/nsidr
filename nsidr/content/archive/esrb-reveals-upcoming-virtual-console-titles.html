The Entertainment Software Ratings Board's website has revealed, by way of posting of its ratings of upcoming titles, eight new titles headed for Wii's Virtual Console service, through which Wii owners can purchase software for their console over the Internet&mdash;primarily, at this point, titles released for other systems running under emulation.  <br />
<br />
These titles are in addition to the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2503">previously-announced 30</a> Nintendo revealed a week ago.  All eight releases are rated E for Everyone.  The titles are:<br />
