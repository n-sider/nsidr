<p>GamesAreFun conducted an interview with the lead designer and president of NeoPong Software Charles Galyon, in which it was revealed his company would bring its RPG tentatively titled <i>Project DA</i> to the Nintendo DS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">Project DA is our next great ambition," Galyon told GamesAreFun.  "Whatever we may demonstrate as an out of the gate, fresh new developer with World Reborn, I can absolutely assure you that our next project will blow it out of the water. We've developed the engines, the techniques and cultivated the experience we need to make something even better and rather than sit and rest on our laurels we only feel more driven to push ourselves harder and produce more.  Additionally I feel I should mention that Project DA is intended for the Nintendo DS. The DS offers a lot of unique opportunities to do things we couldn't previously. Project DA, being intended for the DS, will utilize those abilities to deliver not only an enjoyable and solid RPG experience, but it will also offer unique content and play opportunities.</font></p>
