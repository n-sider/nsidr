<p>Blizzard Entertainment has posted a new <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/jobopp/senior-producer.shtml">job opening</a> for an "experienced Senior Producer with a proven track record of producing high quality console games."  More specifically, the qualifications request someone with Xbox 360, PS3, or Wii production experience. Blizzard has not yet made an official game announcement.</p>

<p>Blizzard is known for its acclaimed PC games including World of Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo.  The company has tried breaking into the console market but has had little success.  StarCraft: Ghost for Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube floundered in development for several years under two different studios before being cancelled.  The 2000 release of StarCraft 64 for the Nintendo 64 was the last console title Blizzard had an actual hand in development.</p>
