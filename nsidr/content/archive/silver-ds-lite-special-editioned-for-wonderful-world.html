It's not even on shelves yet, but plans are already afoot to slap the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2810">recently-announced</a> Gloss Silver DS Lite into a <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2007/05/31/103,1180607636,72646,0,0.html">special edition bundle</a>, alongside Square-Enix's upcoming <i>It's a Wonderful World</i>.<br />

The bundle lands in stores the same day Wonderful World does: July 27.  As with all things "wonderful", this bundle is only available in Japan.  <i>(Thanks to N-Sider Forums' Samer for the tip.)</i>
