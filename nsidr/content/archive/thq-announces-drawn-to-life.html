THQ has announced that it will bring <i>Drawn to Life</i>, the 5th Cell-developed title where the player is responsible for drawing the hero he'll guide through the adventure, to the Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
Using one of four forms including "Flying" and "Aquatic", players use the game's drawing toolset to create a hero to conquer a number of different environments.  The toolset is apparently fairly advanced, with color, brush, and stamp types, and can be used to create both one-of-a-kind characters and game elements.  Players will be able to trade their hero designs over local DS wireless.<br />
<br />
Expect Drawn to Life to appear at North American retail this fall.
