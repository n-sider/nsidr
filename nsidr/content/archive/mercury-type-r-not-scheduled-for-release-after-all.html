<p>We have updated information regarding a story published <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2335">last week</a> claiming Australian publisher QVS will distribute Mercury Type R for developer Ignition Entertainment.  The title was listed on the company's website under its upcoming release schedule.  Paul Elliot, a spokesperson from QVS, has since informed N-Sider that there has been no confirmation of the title's release.  "We are only the Australian distributor for Ignition and have not been officially told this is coming out or even in development," he said in an email.</p>
