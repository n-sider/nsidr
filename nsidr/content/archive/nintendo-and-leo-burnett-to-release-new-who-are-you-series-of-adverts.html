<p>Nintendo and Leo Burnett will be continuing the "Who Are You?" advertising campaign that began in September, 2003, with a new series of commercials.  You can download the new spots <a href="http://www.leoburnett.com/breaking/nintendo/">here</a>.</p>

<p>"Interviewer," which launches this week and showcases Nintendo GameCube software, features a guy in a therapist's office that appears to be living out the personalities and experiences of characters within Nintendo GameCube games. He is transformed by each game's experience and "becomes" the characters he plays. Two 30-second and four 15-second versions of the spot feature game footage from titles including EA Sports' <i>MVP Baseball 2004</i>, Konami's <i>Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</i> and Nintendo's <i>Custom Robo</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures</i>.</p>

<p>The Game Boy Advance will follow with a campaign called "Freeboy."  The spots are said to demonstrate how the Game Boy Advance has "untethered a generation from their gaming consoles and has freed them to enjoy Nintendo games anywhere and everywhere" and "illustrates how a player's perspective on the real world changes as they play." 

<p>Both of these spots will run on network, cable and in syndication and can be seen during the shows on the following networks.</p>
