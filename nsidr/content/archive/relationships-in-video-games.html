Are you kidding me with this "give gifts to make them love you" shit<br />
<br />
Fuck you, harvest moon and animal crossing<br />
<br />
Natural relationships with people who share your likes/beliefs/ideals<br />
<br />
Proximity, time known, what you do with them<br />
<br />
Can't fake it, well, you can fake it, but not with EVERYONE.  Situations arise where you have to take a side and if you're disingenuous people will be all wtf based on what they know about you, but maybe that's the way to be friends with the phonies, or the assholes
