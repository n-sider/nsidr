<br>This is a newly formed studio by the former designer of Street Fighter 2.  The company has thus far developed Chou Dragon Ball Z for PlayStation 2.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Noritaka Funamizu</b> - Executive Director/Designer (Street Fighter II, Dragon Ball arcade)<br>
<i>Oct. 26, 2005</i><br>
Funamizu believes that the Revolution controller will fit perfectly with games where you move a cursor 

about -- in fact, he suggests the controller can do more than an ordinary mouse. A simulation with a focus 

on action would be perfect for the controller, he suggests. Funamizu closes off his comments with the 

prediction that that those who've been making games since the old days will have a easier time with the 

Revolution (a group that includes him, he points out).<br>

<i>June 15, 2005</i><br>
"There hasn't been much information released about it yet. But I'm looking forward to it as a machine that 

will feature a distinct kind of fun, different from the direction that the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 are 

headed." <br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>

<i>Feb. 15, 2006</i><br>
"The beauty of Nintendo's concept controller is that it seems to be adaptable to any genre, including those that have yet to be invented. Right out of the gate the wireless & gyroscope combination covers the light gun and music/rhythm genres, and with an aesthetic add-on the controller looks like it'll easily change into a racing wheel. Personally, my mind immediately imagines a hybrid of the Vader duel in Sega's 1998 Star Wars  arcade game backed up by a combat engine similar to Treyarch's freestyling fighter Die by the Sword. The proposed accessories that transform the Revolution's remote stick into a conventional controller can only sweeten the deal&mdash;imagine popping a plastic sword guard onto the remote for simulated saber action, or a top-heavy accoutrement to emulate a hefty axe. Still, the most appealing concepts are the mysterious ones Nintendo itself will most likely churn out, leaving us common folk to hang our jaws open in complete astonishment."<br>
<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>
"Absolutely. The new controller will set Nintendo apart in a console market dominated by hardware specs, 

open up a new playing field for developers, and give consumers the new experiences they've been clamoring 

for. Now that processing resources are virtually unlimited, it's going to take a drastic move to bring 

gaming to the next levelsomething that the Revolution's controller could very well 

accomplish."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>

<b>Soeren Lund</b><br>
<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>
"Personally, I welcome the new controller design from Nintendo. Whether the Revolution controller is going 

to be a success or not, of course, still remains to be seen. The novelty and sheer "differentness" of the 

design has divided many people into pro and con factions, and who is going to be right whole depends on if 

people can think outside the conventional game interfaces. What the controller design and Nintendo's video 

has done is to make developers think of totally new ways to interact with the games, which in my book is a 

success already in itself. The controller is the last part of a console design that hasn't been evolving at 

the same pace as every other machine part, and this new design is certainly a kick in the head for many 

people. Hooray for innovation and hopefully we, as game designers, will be able to wield the new mechanics 

that has been made available to us."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>

It means that when it makes good business sense for the company to do so, we will bring our franchises to certain platforms in specific regional markets.

"The beauty about being an independent publisher is that you can support any platform, of course, and we are going to support all three. It's quite apparent that it's going to be a much closer race this time around. Sony has had a recent history of being the clear winner, and I don't think anybody believes that's going to be the case this time. It's going to be a much closer race and significantly, I think Nintendo, with the Wii console, is going to be right back up in the thick of it. It's quite interesting that they've decided not to go head-to-head with Microsoft and Sony, with the high quality interactive cinematic action adventure games; they've gone for gameplay over graphics instead. I think that's quite an interesting move and it could be very successful for them."

<br><IMG src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/partnerships-electronicarts.jpg" border=0><br>On March 

6, 2003 Nintendo and Electronic Arts announced a collaboration on multiple games that would include 

exclusive features for connected play between the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Games including 

titles such as Madden NFL 2004 and The Sims were developed by EA, with Nintendo game producer Shigeru 

Miyamoto providing input on technical game play elements. Nintendo has built a close relationship with 

Electronic Arts and while Sega pulled its sports titles from the GameCube, EA continues to support the 

console. Being one of the world's largest publishers, it's very likely EA has several Wii titles 

cooking. <br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Larry Probst</b> - Chairman and CEO<br>
<i>Sep. 14, 2006</i><br>
"I believe the Wii will attract new and casual gamers to the world of interactive entertainment. It's a fun, easy and economical system that will become a bridge to gaming for mainstream audiences. At EA, we are putting more support behind the Wii than any Nintendo hardware launch since the Super NES."<br><br>

<b>Jeff Brown</b><br>
<i>Jul. 17, 2006</i><br>
"Everybody's saying that the Nintendo Wii is so unique that it's going to be the second system people buy, meaning if you own a 360 or a PS3, you'll probably also buy a Nintendo Wii. The funny thing is, some people say that discursively, like it's some sort of dig at Nintendo - and what they don't get is that if you're second on everybody's system, you're first overall.  One of the things that we noticed after E3 is we
thought, you know, we're going to support Nintendo,
they've got an extraordinarily loyal base of consumers
all over the world, and we had a number of games we
planned to make for Nintendo Wii. That said, we were
very surprised by the level of enthusiasm we saw at E3
and subsequently for the Wii."<br><br>


<b>Chris Cross</b> - Design Director EA LA<br>
<i>Sept. 19, 2005</i><br>
"Personally Im excited about the new controller. It seems like it will be intuitive for most and a very 

cool alternative to the standard control paradigm. If we assume game design starts with the interface, 

try to imagine what new genres might pop up.  I cant wait to get one in my hands and try it out. 

Realistically for the first couple years most developers will be adapting their old games to fit this 

interface with only a couple really taking advantage of it. Give it a couple game cycles and we should see 

some interesting stuff at E3 '07. I havent been this excited since Sony put a second stick on their 

controller."<br><br>

<b>Vince Dickinson</b> - EA Tiburon<br>
<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>

"I think it's a fantastic move for the industry (and gamers). Who isn't looking forward to seeing what fun 

and unique new games Nintendo comes up with? I know I'll be first in line. If anyone can deliver on the 

promise of expanding the market, it's Nintendo -- and they've proved that in Japan with DS Brain Training 

and Nintendogs. I think it's also a good move for Nintendo's bottom line as well, as it further 

differentiates them (in a positive manner) from Sony and Microsoft, which is critical. As for third 

parties, I think it will be successful for companies that invest the resources to create Nintendo-caliber 

games. I doubt you'll see as much third party support for the Revolution as the PS3 & Xbox 360, which 

leaves a great big opening of opportunity for adventurous or niche developers to fill. But companies whose 

businesses are built on raw cross-platform development are going to see the fewest copies sold on the 

Revolution."<br><br>

<b>John Schappert</b> - VP and GM EA Canada<br>
<i>Jan. 1, 2006</i><br>
"We've got hands on with the Revolution and, sure enough, the controller is revolutionary.  It is a control 

device unlike anything else we have played before." <br>
<i>Dec. 15, 2005</i><br>
"As a longtime Nintendo fan, I applaud the spirit of innovation and creativity of the Revolution 

controller. Being wireless and designed similarly to a TV controller, it's an innovative, ergonomic winner 

right out of the box. The beauty of the controller is that possibilities for new game ideas are 

limitless...You can build an entire game concept around the controller's features or find ways to 

intregrate them into existing franchises. Right now at EA, we're exploring both of these paths. Our 

developers are inspired and excited by the new controller's features."<br>
<i>Sept. 18, 2005</i><br>

"Game control is essential - it's the area where perhaps the most game-play improvement can be made. While 

our portfolio represents a full array of titles across all genres, I think our sports titles might be the 

first to immediately take advantage of what this novel 'freehand' type of control has to offer."<br><br> 

<b>Will Wright</b> - Designer (Spore, The Sims)<br>
<i>Aug. 9, 2006</i><br>
"We've been messing around with the Wii dev kit and we're really interested in the possibilities there. It's possible the editors might be more manageable on that system. The DS is also very interesting to us, as its control scheme could be very manageable for the game."<br>
<i>May 14, 2006</i><br>
"I'm rooting for Nintendo...What I don't like is that the way the Wii controller works depends a lot on how close you are to your TV. If you are five feet away it feels one way. If you are 10 feet away, it feels completely different."<br>
<i>Nov. 16, 2005</i><br>
"Im really interested in the Revolution, to see how the controller works out. That looks pretty cool. It 

looks very interesting to me. I like the idea of taking the games more outside the box and more into that 

close-body kind of space."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>

controller, I was really just saying that a byproduct of having a device like this is that people are going 

to make games that possibly are just there because of the controller, as opposed to being great games of 

themselves, and I said it badly...I regret that...Nintendo and some of the best third parties are going to 

make amazing games for it...I think Unreal Engine 3 and Nintendo Revolution would be very well suited to 

each other...We don't know right now what the machine's capable of or not capable of, and we've built 

Unreal Engine 3 to a certain specification. If the machine can run the engine, it'd be fantastic to have it

<br>Located in Canada, Exile is known for collaboratively developing titles with Sega's 

Visual Concepts studio. Most recently, the company worked on Nintendo Pennant Chase Baseball with Nintendo 

for the GameCube, however the title was never released and has since quietly disappeared. It's possible the 

game may return on Wii.<br><br>

"I think that Nintendo has at the least secured second place for the next console cycle with this control 

scheme. There are a lot of games that it really won't add a great deal to, and I can see a lot of hard core 

gamers being resistant to this. But what I am dead certain of is that Nintendo is going to quietly dominate 

at retail due to demo units of the Revolution. This thing will draw in crowds. I am thinking that even 

given what Nintendo will lose from jaded gamers who cannot stand any more "kiddie crap" to Microsoft and 

Sony, that they will pick up at least that many from the Nintendogs crowd."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>

<BR><IMG src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/partnerships-factor5.jpg" border=0><br>Originally 

located in Cologne, Germany, Factor 5 was offered in 1995 -- due to close collaboration with LucasArts -- a 

move to Northern California. In May 1996 the staff, consisting of 19 people (Among them developers, 

programmers, graphic artists and musicians), moved to San Rafael, California (Marin County). Factor 5 first 

started developing titles for Lucas Arts on the PlayStation. However, it moved on and started toying with 

the Nintendo 64. Its first major endeavor would turn out to be a development necessity rather than a game; 

it decided to rewrite the Nintendo 64's sound tools and use its own proprietary sound tools titled MusyX 

and MORT. Nintendo has had a very close relationship with the developer. Factor 5 also created the sound 

tools for Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and the Nintendo GameCube. The company was one of the first 

developers to receive development kits for the GameCube, showing off its first GameCube title, Star Wars 

Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II, at Nintendo's 2000 Spaceworld show. Most recently Factor 5, in 

collaboration with Lucas Arts, released Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike on Oct. 21, 2003. At the 

2003 E3 Expo, it was also all but confirmed that Factor 5 was working on a Pilotwings sequel for GameCube. 

However, it's rumored that the companies had a sort of falling out after the release of Rogue Squadron III 

and that Pilotwings is no longer in development. Recently, the company pledged full support for the 

PlayStation 3.<br><br><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>

If you say, "Oh, you can only use the controller as a gimmick," you're not likely to come up with 

something that isn't a gimmick. I think for a lot of developers, the jury is out until they can get it and 

try it for themselves, but I don't think there are too many people in the development community who've 

dismissed it out of hand based on what they've seen so far. With respect to big franchises that we play on 

other platforms, I think some of the Revolution offerings may bring some new, better approaches to doing 

things we're used to doing with a joystick. I don't think it's accurate [that Revolution will have trouble 

with traditional games], and I don't think it matters as much as people think it will. You'll see some 

people take stabs at totally original things, and you'll see some people just do a few Revolution specific 

things. How many of the "new game types" will stick is impossible to say. Just like DS, there will be a 

period of gimmicky things that kind of don't work, and there may be some traditional genres that may be 

really enhanced by the controller, and then there is always the chance that there will some crazy breakout 

hit that changes everything! It's a bummer, and a little irritating, but for the next generation, it's 

probably not required that your system support HD. I have an HDTV, but I still watch a lot of plain old 

NTSC content. If the games are good, people won't care if they have to play them in 480i. If the games 

suck, 1080p doesn't fix that, either!<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>

forward to the 360 and the PS3 as much as anyone, but I have to admit to a certain degree of "generation 

fatigue" before the next one's even started. Seeing the Revolution remote changed all of that, and I'm 

really looking forward to getting my hands on it. Even if it ends up being a Nintendo-only supported 

gimmick, it's well worth it. Waving my hand around to make Mario run? I'm so there. So thanks, Nintendo,

"While some watched the growing number of buttons on controllers with alarm, Nintendo has bravely taken on 

the problem, not only by reducing the number of them but also by breaking from the tradition of holding a 

controller with both hands.  It was a surprise, especially since Revolution will enable gameplay that past 

consoles couldn't.  This has expanded the ability for game creators to pursue their visions."<br>

Sugimori was surprised when he first saw the controller. He feels that many people have been thrown off 

from gaming due to increased button counts of controllers, but states that it takes a good amount of 

courage to actually decide to reduce the number. "You'll be able to do things with the Revolution that you 

could never do with consoles before," he says, adding with a laugh, "Personally, it's the kind of hardware 

where, more than making games, I'd rather play them."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index2">Return to Index Page</a>
