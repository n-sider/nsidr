<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>
"I shudder to think what the game industry would look life if only Microsoft and Sony were left to duel it 

out. I could honestly see another crash looming were it not for Nintendo's breath of fresh air. The PS3 and 

X360 are so homogenized it's not even funny. They both have virtually the same specs and have functionally 

identical controllers. As a designer I'm extremely excited by all the new possibilities the Revolution 

controller will bring. As a gamer, I'm salivating. When the most innovative thing Microsoft or Sony could 

come up with is higher resolutions, Nintendo comes out of left field with something that just may be a 

Revolution. I can't see this thing failing 3rd party support or not."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

<br>Game Republic is a Japanese studio formed by former Capcom employee Yoshiki Okamoto. 

 The company created the Genji series which is described as a mix between Capcom's Devil May Cry and 

Onimusha.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Yoshiki Okamoto</b> - President (Street Fighter)<br>

<i>Oct. 26, 2005</i><br>
Okamoto believes that the controller has such appeal that even those who lack imagination light up with 

wonder at what can be done with the device. He admits to having just a few ideas himself, including an 

action RPG and a horror game so scary that it almost makes you throw your controller.<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

<BR>Randy Pitchford, president of Gearbox, responded to a question from GamerCC noting that he 

finds the Revolution console interesting and looks forward to creating games for it. He said the company 

already has ideas that would be ideal for the interface possibilities of the Revolution. Gearbox is known 

for its first-person shooter Brothers In Arms series.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Randy Pitchford</b> - President (Brothers in Arms)<br>
<i>Oct. 18, 2005</i><br>
I don't think that the scope of a game has anything to do with the interface. The scope of the games are 

going to be driven by the dreams of our customers. If customers are there demanding these games, the games 

will be there, too. The big publishers don't like to leave money on the table, so they'll find a way to 

make the biggest brands work on the Revolution. Nintendo has driven the way on console interfaces for quite 

some time -- I think this one is a big, interesting step that we're all going to want to pay attention to. 

I think the analog "aiming" of the controller is really neat. The idea that we can have full, rich gaming 

experiences that we can interface with one hand is really exciting to me.<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

president has also confirmed an unspecified Wii game in development.  That title has since been identified as "Heroes."<br><br>

"In truth, I have yet to get my hands on Revolution," Suda admits, but adds that he expects to get some 

hands on time shortly. Once he saw the controller at the product announcement, he felt that there was no 

choice but to make games for it. "I've already finalized a plan. Now, all that remains is to make it." The 

game will focus heavily on direct input through the controller, and will, he promises, exceed Killer 

7.<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

<br>Founded in 1995, Harmonix is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The company is known for its 

unique musical video games such as Karaoke Revolution and Amplitude.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Rob Kay</b> - Lead Designer at Harmonix (Guitar Hero, Antigrav)<br>
<i>May 16, 2006</i><br>
"I had my first encounter with the Wii yesterday, in terms of actually using the thing. I am a pretty big Nintendo fan, in fact a lot of us at Harmonix are. I'm sure anyone who has been into games for a while is probably a Nintendo fan. So we have really high expectations and we are very excited about it for some of the reasons that you eluded to there. It's like this natural control scheme, where suddenly it's not about how many bizarre symbols on buttons can I remember in what contrived order for every single game I play. But instead it's more like - "Oh I'm going to move my hands and do gestures, and interact in ways that feel human and natural anyway." So we have really high expectations. And I think from Nintendo's E3 lineup, they have met that to a point, but they still have a lot to prove. I really enjoyed playing the tennis game, and loved how you held the Wii remote actually affected your type of shot. If you tilted your hand back you could get a backspin, you could slice it, get a topspin; that all felt really natural. Perhaps a little light as a game, I'm not quite sure where they are going to go with it. Some of their games had more traditional control schemes like Mario. I am a huge Mario fan and I love the transition to 3D that it's taken. I really hope that the new Galaxy game does well; I was only able to play 3 minutes."<br>
<i>Dec. 20, 2005</i><br>
"Nintendo invented the modern joypad, so it's only right that they say it's time for a change, and have the 

confidence to go for it with Revolution. The move away from the standard joypad configuration, and towards 

a true 3D controller, is both staggering and welcome. Ultimately the Revolution presents an incredibly 

exciting new space for the games industry to explore, and as such it's a breath of fresh air. I agree with 

Nintendo that we need to make games more inviting to non-gamers, and keep the current gamers engaged by 

offering new experiences they haven't encountered before."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

<blockquote>
<b>Kou Shibusawa</b> - Producer<br>
<i>June 15, 2005</i><br>

"It seems to be going in a different direction from the other two consoles, and it's trying to develop its 

own unique market. Being able to play old games from the Famicom era should be enticing to the gaming 

generation, and as a creator, I look forward to playing my games that I have a special fondness for. Aside 

from having good graphics, the Revolution's uniqueness and concentration towards gameplay should make it a 

product that's good towards all ages."<br><br>

<b>Yoshiki Sugiyama</b> - Producer (Dynasty Warriors)<br>
<i>Dec. 28, 2005</i><br>
When asked about the Revolution, PS3, and Xbox 360, he states that Koei will be fully supporting all 

platforms, although he adds that he hopes to make Revolution games. The game that left the greatest 

impression with Sugiyama was Nintendo's Train Your Brain (Nou wo Kitaeru). The event or happening that left 

the greatest impression with him was Nintendo's Touch Generations, a lineup of titles that appeal to a new 

user group (the lineup includes Train Your Brain, Nintendogs, and other successes).<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

<BR><IMG src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/partnerships-konami.jpg" border=0><br>On Feb. 28, 2003, 

Konami Entertainment announced it was in development with a Metal Gear Solid title for the Nintendo 

GameCube.  The title came via Nintendo's then funded developer Silicon Knights. Konami has since 

collaborated on Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix for the GameCube. Konami has several important franchises 

under its belt including the Silent Hill, Metal Gear Solid, and Castlevania series. Konami is an important 

ally for Nintendo to have on its side -- especially for the titles that appeal to older gamers. Konami has 

said that it has an original title in development for the Wii. <br><br>

<b>Geoff Mulligan</b> - COO of KDE<br>

"In order for our industry to continue to grow, we've got to think about gaming and games differently. That's exactly what Nintendo is doing."<br><br>

<b>Hiroshi Tanibuchi</b> - Producer (Powerful Pro Baseball)<br>
<i>Oct. 26, 2005</i><br>
Konami's Hiroshi Tanibuchi, producer of the Power Pro baseball series, states that he personally likes 

games that make you move your body and is interested in making an action game that uses both hands. He's 

also interested in the Wii-DS link up.<br>
<i>Oct. 21, 2005</i><br>

"In truth -- and this is just between us -- I was able to get my hands on the controller. The on-screen 

characters move in accordance with the controller's movements -- it's such a fresh feeling. Although you 

probably won't understand until you've tried it yourself...If we were to make it [Prowerful Pro Baseball], 

we'd want to make a special Power Pro for the Revolution." <br><br>

<b>Hideo Kojima</b> - Producer (Metal Gear)<br>
<i>Dec. 28, 2005</i><br>
He does admit to wanting to make games for all three next generation platforms, though, giving the nod in 

particular to Revolution as a platform that, as a designer, it would be "foolish" for him to pass up on. 

With Revolution, he adds, he'd like to make strides in areas other than graphics and sound. This is a 

change for him, as he believes he's known as someone who pursues realistic visuals owing to his love of 

movies.<br>
<i>Dec. 15, 2005</i><br>
"The Revolution will be popular with girls." He says he wants to make a game "based on life, something 

organic," something that will bring him closer to the movie directors and novelists he admires, and that 

the Revolution is the most capable means of achieving that goal.<br>
<i>Sept. 18, 2005</i><br>

"'You've done it' was my impression. This was totally unexpected. I was pleasantly surprised, because the 

controller is quite comfortable yet provides something brand new...even though it was a surprise to me at 

first, once I touched the controller I quickly understood how it should be used much like a remote control 

for your TV. This is exactly what I was looking for."<br>

"If the game creators and the users want to have a great steak for their anniversary, they go maybe to PS3. 

But if they want great dinner, great steak with their family, a little bit more casual during the weekends, 

they might select Xbox 360. Or why not have a great steak at your house everyday, they might choose 

Revolution. So my impression of the battle between the consoles is, its not about what kind of dinner it 

is. Its more about how much the dinner will be. Will it be worth the cost of being served? Or where can I 

have this dinner - number of restaurants, is it near my house or do I have to take a cab or train or bus? I 

think the battle amongst the next-gen platforms lies in that area."<br><br>

<b>Akari Uchida</b> - Producer (Rumble Roses)<br>
<i>Oct. 15, 2005</i><br>
"I would like to come up with play ideas involving the direct influencing of characters on the screen with 

that controller.  I can think of a lot of naughty things if I were to do something with Rumble 

Roses."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

<BR><a href="http://www.kromestudios.com/">Krome Studios</a> is known for its Ty the Tasmanian series of titles appearing on PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox.  The studio is based in Brisbane, Australia.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Steve Stamatiadis</b> - Creative Director (TY)<br>
<i>Jul. 10, 2006</i><br>
"Krome Studios is really excited about Nintendo's
new console Wii, and we love the DS as well. It'll be
at least a year before we come out with a game for
either system as we're pretty busy working on our
current projects but that said we've had ongoing
discussions and design meetings about future projects
which definitely includes supporting the Nintendo
hardware. For instance, we know that TY the Tasmanian
Tiger has and will continue to be a perfect franchise
for the Nintendo gamers so it's safe to say that our
furry little yellow friend is a great candidate for
Nintendo's DS and Wii consoles. Also, it will depend
on what publishers want from us and what they think
will appeal to the market."
<i>Feb. 02, 2006</i><br>
"We're looking into the Nintendo Revolution as a possible target for future TY the Tasmanian Tiger games. A lot of it depends on a publisher and what platforms they think will sell. Personally I'm intrigued by the Revolution — I like that Nintendo is taking a different approach to how people play games and is aiming for a wider audience. Though, I don't like the fact that it means cross platform games like the TY the Tasmanian Tiger series will be much harder to develop on Next Gen consoles. The Revolution's new controller doesn't help, even though I think it's an awesome development — cooler even than Sony's Eye Toy. I'd love to get the chance to do a Revolution only TY game — that would be awesome."<br><br>

"As much as I'm excited about the possibilities of new genres, I'm also very excited about playing existing genres in new, and possibly better, ways. Here's an obvious example: A Harry Potter adventure game. Yeah, you can wave the wand around and cast spells, everybody's said that, but that alone is boring. What I want to see is this: You walk and turn with the thumb stick attachment, using the buttons for actions and to lock onto targets and circle them like in Metroid Prime (no aiming with the wand in this game, Harry Potter isn't about head shots). The wand is used to case spells - in conjunction with a microphone attachment!
Imagine having to speak the spell you want to cast, and using different wand movements to create variations on the spell (maybe the closer you are to a 'correct' movement the more powerful it is, or maybe you can flick it in different directions to throw people about). This would add a whole new level of immersion to the game. No more lame button pressing or cycling through a spell list, just speak and cast like a real wizard! And learning spells would be much more fun to, having to recite the incantation (so that you match the preset words while at the same time the game recognizes the uniqueness of your voice).
Finally, let people create their characters and spend a year at Hogwarts — the kids would go nuts over it — and hell, even I'd buy it. Harryous Revolutionis!"<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>

<BR>Kuju Entertainment collaborated with Nintendo Japan on Advance Wars: Under Fire for 

GameCube. The company has developed several games in the past including Lotus Challenge for Xbox and Fire 

Warrior for PlayStation 2. Kuju has also been developing PlayStation 2 technology since September 1999 and 

Xbox specific code since April 2000. Post-Rare, Kuju is Nintendo's starting point at building stronger 

relationships with European developers.<br><br>

<I>"Nintendo historically is not so active enough in building up the working relationships with the 

European developers. But I can say that things are improving right now; however, I am not satisfied in the 

current condition and I believe we need to make efforts to improve our relationship with European

<br>Level 5 is quickly gaining a name

Believes that the Revolution will give birth to new types of games. He is personally interested in making 

an RPG where you hold a shield in one hand, a sword in the other and mount a head set on our head -- 

although he laughs that this would be impossible. More seriously, he seems concerned about players getting 

tired due to all the hand movement, regardless of how much fun they're having. The hardware has a lot of 

potential, but he hopes that games are designed so that even if they're played for lengthy periods people 

won't get tired.<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index3">Return to Index Page</a>
