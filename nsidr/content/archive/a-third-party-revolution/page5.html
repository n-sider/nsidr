<br>Lionhead Studios was formed in 1997 by Peter Molyneux.  Based in the United Kingdom, 

the company has created the revered Black & White series.  After facing financial difficulties in early 2006, the studio was purchased by Microsoft.<br><br>

<b>Peter Molyneux</b> - President (Black & White, Fable, The Movies)<br>

"Well, I have been through console wars before, but this one strikes me as particularly interesting. Nintendo has done a great job of convincing us that next gen is about game play rather than high-tech specs. Microsoft has done an incredible job of expanding games online and making them more mass market. Sony, in my view, seems it has been rather more lazy with their message. How all this pans out really depends on one thing and that is the brilliance of the titles that appear on each platform over the next two to three years. Marketing the hardware is nothing compared to the games that run on it, so I expect the system with the greatest games on it to end up on top."<br>
<i>Oct. 27, 2005</i><br>
"I've heard rumors about it for a little while, and I can tell you it's a great great product, and that's 

exactly what I meant by never underestimate Nintendo. You know, this is a Revolution. It's not the hardware 

of the machine, it's not the speed of the machine, it's the fact that the device will enable games to be 

made unlike no other have ever been...Well, I mean, you know, absolutely [want to develop Revolution 

games]. It, it's so exciting to actually, for the first time, feel that you can move something in a 3D 

space. I mean, the controllers that we're currently using on the other consoles, really have their origin 

in platform games. They have no sympathy for moving around in a 3D world, and that's what makes Revolution 

so exciting. Yeah, I would love to be doing something for it."<br><br>

"It will be best suited, from the looks of things, to 'physical' games, meaning that it's the natural inheritor of the dancemat, EyeToy and DS touchpad type of game. Movement-measurement and reaction games are the sort of thing for which this device will naturally provide a home. Beyond that, it's hard to say. Not being a particularly big fan of those types of games, as they tend to be very shallow. My big fear is that the Revolution is going to over-popularize shallow physical gaming such that everyone starts doing it and suddenly cooking simulators and orchestra-conducting games are going to be popping up on all formats. I'm all for people having the games that they want to play, but this business has a high degree of a herd-mentality. If the Revolution succeeds then everyone's going to be making "Fried-Egg-Flipping-Simulator 3.""<br><br></blockquote>

"This move is beneficial to Nintendo and the game industry as a whole. We will always be able to push 

graphics and computing hardware, but it takes something truly innovative to change how we interact with our 

games. It seems to be the mind set that we have come to the peak of controller design and nothing could 

beat the PS2 controller configuration. Unfortunately, that mind set limits our industry. We should never 

stop exploring new ways to interact with our games. With a new interface comes new game genres, and new 

ways to experience games as a whole. What makes this controller great in design is that not only will it 

allow for new genre types, but it's also perfectly compatible with current genres out there, and if any 

thing it can push these old genres to a whole new level in their own right. Yet, with this much 

functionality the controller is still simple in design and look. Nintendo has built this simplicity into a 

form people are already comfortable with, a standard TV remote. This will surely grab people that were 

scared by the complexity of the current controller schemes, yet allow them as much control as a player who 

uses a PS2 controller. It's a risky move to develop a whole new way to interact with our games. I'm sure a 

lot of third parties are scared, and they're worried about the potential for porting their product to the 

Nintendo system, but once Nintendo releases some first party titles and shows the market how to truly 

utilize the controller, the fear will wane. I even think that if these third parties port their titles 

right, they will play even better on the Revolution because of the controller. I also feel that Nintendo 

isn't dependent on the third parties to launch its system; most people I know buy a Nintendo for the first 

party titles alone. Honestly, we should thank Nintendo for continually pushing the envelope and trying to 

move our industry to the next level."<br><br></blockquote>

Wada was at first taken back by the controller. He found it to be small and nicely designed, but as a 

controller, it crossed the bounds of his understanding. Once he got his hands on it, he suddenly got the 

idea and felt that it would work. This is similar to how he felt with the DS -- the feeling of various 

ideas appearing one after the other. "As a creator, this is the ultimate toy," he states with a laugh, but 

also adds caution, saying, "A number of basic ideas come forth, but placing those properly into a game and 

making players have fun is difficult." Wada seems to love the controller, though, as he adds, "Isn't this 

the thing that will cause a revolution to the game industry, which has slowly lost its

"I think it was interesting to see Nintendo's announcement for the Revolution downloadable games service which, of course, came over a year after we launched our initiative internally and around nine months after we already launched the first generation of Arcade for Xbox. I think it was a responsive move. Their service is interesting in sort of a 'retro' way, but I view Arcade as being so much more than what they're planning on doing. Their service is kind of a subset of what we're doing. We have a retro coin-op category within Arcade - the Midway titles have been performing amazingly - and we're doing a lot more in that space. Of course, we're doing Street Fighter, we've announced our partnership with Konami, Atari, and Midway - more titles are coming from Midway. So, we're going to be doing a lot in the retro space, console and coin-op. But that's just one part of the Arcade strategy...We're taking a much larger view of this space than Nintendo. Arcade is really about small downloadable games of all types. Look at Geometry Wars; it's our Halo. That's not a 10-year-old retro title that you're running on some sort of emulator. That's a new title that was designed specifically for Xbox 360. We have titles coming from new, independent developers that are coming up with new play concepts and innovative things for the next generation of consoles...When I look at Nintendo Revolution's retro story, with all due respect to Nintendo, I think it's a small subset of the opportunity here. To be honest with you, a lot of those games are fun in your head when you think, 'Oh, yeah when I was 12, this was really fun,' and you have these great nostalgic reasons to play them. Then you do play them, and they're just not very fun anymore. But, there are some games like Joust or Gauntlet or Pac-Man that are as fun today as they were back then...A lot of those Nintendo games, you know, aren't gonna hold up."<br><br>

Since the Wii controller has fewer buttons than a traditional PlayStation or Xbox controller I was wondering at the time what we would be able to substitute for the missing buttons. Remember, at the time of the original interview, I hadn't even touched a Wii controller.

being anti-Nintendo during Yamauchi's reign, to pro-Nintendo and one of the company's largest GameCube 

supporters. The company's relationship has grown so strong over the past few years that the two companies 

have already collaboratively developed four titles -- Star Fox Assault, Mario Superstar Baseball, Pac-Man 

Vs., and Donkey Kong, for the GameCube. In August 2003, Nintendo even allowed Namco to include its 

cherished Legend of Zelda character "Link" as a playable character in the GameCube build of Soul Calibur 

II. That version of the game outsold its PS2 and Xbox counterparts. Namco has released several RPGs for the 

GameCube including Tales of Symphonia and Baten Kaitos. Beyond those titles, Namco has many other 

recognizable series including Tekken, Ridge Racer, Klonoa, and Time Crisis. Namco is an exceptional ally 

and has a great relationship with Nintendo.  Nintendo's Reggie Fils-Aime confirmed the company's support at the February 2006 DICE conference.<br><br>

the world, comprised of 53 subsidiaries in 18 countries. Bandai is an exceptional partner for Nintendo to 

have on its side. Nintendo realizes this and has heavily invested in the company, causing many rumors that 

Nintendo may try to obtain a majority stake in the Bandai.  Namco and Bandai have since announced a merge of their two companies.<br><br>

including a text input style game that targets people who've become used to inputting text with their 

thumbs on the cell phone. The controller gives the creative spirit of game creators a jolt, Iwatani states 

before finishing up his comments by asking that Nintendo continue from here on out to stimulate gamers and 

creators alike in new ways.<br><br>

"There will be many people who play with friends and
family. Nintendo DS connectivity is also interesting.
It will probably become the Wii's touch screen
controller. (in regards to games) With Nintendo
hardware, your biggest rival is Nintendo." <br><br></blockquote>

"[Nintendo] did an amazing job this year. They did everything right. They released the name change a week and half before E3. From my experience talking to other people, the name caught other people off guard, but asking them about it today during the E3 show, everyone has changed their opinion; they think the name fits and it's simply amazing...Unfortunately, it's still early on, so there's no really concrete details. But the one thing I can say with the unique Wii controller, and if anyone knows Harvest Moon and what you do in Harvest Moon, they seem like a perfect fit."<br><br></blockquote>

<b>Warren Blyth</b><br>
<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>

"This will be great for the industry in general. The majority of our customers are too dense to understand 

that there are better ways to play games than joysticks, mice, and keyboards. They don't even understand 

why you'd want to move in true 3D space (all 6 degrees of freedom), or why you'd want to touch a screen 

instead of positioning a cursor on it. They think that technology from 20 years back is still used to 

control games because it's still the best. It's ridiculous. I work for a company that has been selling a 

motion tracking game input device since 2001 (based on your simple head movement, instead of a 

wand/remote), and we're fascinated to see how Nintendo handles the paradigm shift. It will be a huge 

benefit for innovative companies (hardware or software) when Nintendo educates the mass market about what 

new technology can offer."<br><br></blockquote>

<br>A newly formed studio in Poland that hopes to develop Raid Over the River for the Nintendo DS and 

Wii.  The company also hopes to develop a title called Sadness for Wii, which it describes as "gothic horror which will scare not with the amount of blood but sheer atmosphere."<br><br>

<blockquote>

<i>Dec. 12, 2005</i><br>
Responding to an inquiry from <a 

href="http://www.revolutionreport.com/articles/read/203">RevolutionReport</a>, he said the company "would 

like to do this game directly for Wii and DS," adding further that "only Nintendo platforms [will] 

get this game." Responding to why Raid over the River would only come to Nintendo's console rather than 

Xbox 360 or PS3, Orlowski stated, "Nintendo is our life. We have all of the Nintendo consoles; we are 

fans." "To be honest - we don't have a Revolution development kit yet, so we're doing a version on PC but 

we have a lot of ideas [of how to] use the Revolution controller."<br><br></blockquote>

<BR>Nintendo's worldwide offices house some 3,000 employees, more than 850 of which are directly involved in game development. Nintendo recently restructured its Japanese development studios and so the delineation between the old and new development groups have been altered.

<br>Founded in 1985 in London, NovaLogic develops PC and console video games. They are especially 

known for their PC games such as Delta Force, Commanche, and other flying games.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Kent Simon</b><br>
<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>
"User interface is nearly everything to a successful game and today's current console controllers still 

lack a level of fine control. If the controller for the Revolution solves that problem, we will see the 

controller copied to other platforms. It's always good to be the first with something new as long as there 

are games available that make good use of the new technology. I think it's good for the whole industry, to 

see a big manufacturer tamper with the user interface; it lets us know that it's acceptable to think 

outside the box and make big moves forward. Nintendo is not waiting for everyone else; they are leading the 

way with the user interface, with the DS and now the Revolution. New types of games and maybe better 

gameplay for the old type is in store for us, that should be good for Nintendo."<br><br>

<b>Jordan Blackman</b><br>

<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>
"The move is beneficial for Nintendo because they are offering something compelling and different with the 

potential to make them a lot of money. It's beneficial for third party developers because it gives us an 

opportunity to develop new concepts into intuitive and groundbreaking games which don't have to be 

impossibly ambitious to be exciting and impressive. It's beneficial for the industry in general because it 

has the potential to expand the market to folks who might otherwise be intimidated. So, for the record, 

that's a yes, a yes, and a yes."<br><br></blockquote>

<br>Nubytech has been on the market several years developing peripherals for the major consoles. 

One of their most unique creations was the chainsaw controller that was released alongside Resident Evil 

4.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Paul Chen</b> - President<br>
<i>Jan. 20, 2006</i><br>
"The first time we looked at it (the controller), it was extremely exciting to see something so different 

and innovative. I don't think it is innovative from the sense that "oh it is just a remote control," I 

think more so from the standpoint that it has such unique features. The way it interfaces with the game and 

the way it can add additional interactive elements to the game. That's the part that is truly exciting. The 

other part that is truly exciting comes from the point that it would bring a different consumer to the 

platform as opposed to just your traditional "game consumer." This is something that a more casual consumer 

who doesn't play games all the time such as a mom, or a family could get into. We were excited to see 

something that was so unique."<br><br></blockquote>
