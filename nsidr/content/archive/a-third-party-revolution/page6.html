"We are very interested in making games for the Revolution. The challenge will be in our approach to these games. As we think about the Xbox 360 and the PS3 we see a lot of similarities between the systems so it will be relatively easy to have a game ship on both platforms. We don't necessarily see those kinds of similarities with the Revolution. Games that are made for the Revolution will really have to be re-conceived for that platform and can't simply be a port. While on the one hand that could mean fewer games for the Revolution, the games that do ship on the platform will probably be crafted with a lot more thought and care than would go into your average port. So yes, we are interested in developing entertainment for the Revolution - but only for the select group of games that really make sense."<br><br>

<b>Josh Resnick</b> - CEO<br>
<i>Mar. 29, 2006</i><br>
"We're enthralled with the platform just as much as we are with the 360 and PS3. Each of them have very different strengths that our games are going to play to. But we haven't announced any commitments yet...Well the Revolution is a very different platform, and we've actually just seen some things behind closed doors that are just mind-blowing. Very very exciting. They're doing something that's very different and unique. I agree that it's going to challenge the notion of just doing a port. I don't think it's going to be as easy to take a product from one console to the Revolution, and so I think we are going to be looking to see how we can tailor our products to that platform. But we do that also with other platforms as well, it's just that the Revolution may challenge us even more."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index5">Return to Index Page</a>

"I'd like to know more about the software. When the announcement came out there was a whole lot of buzz 

about what could be done with the controller, but I have yet to see some video or feature doing the 

internet rounds in the same way that the PS3's E3 "Killzone" movie did. There's a lot of talk about what 

you could do...how about showing an amazing game running that is an absolute 

must-have-must-play-must-get-on-day-one system seller? I think if you showed what is being done with the 

unit it would make the potential of the controller clear. I would have preferred it if Nintendo had perhaps 

talked to more of the third party developers to get feedback on the controller from us, but I think it's 

all conducted internally. Nintendo has made a surprising move. As a gamer, I'm keen to get my hands on one 

and see what happens when the games start flowing. They will be different; that's about all we can be sure 

of."<br><br>

"A lot of incredibly addictive arcade games can be moved into the living room now. Go to any Japanese 

arcade and you'll see people playing fishing games, dog walking games etc, and they're fun largely because 

of the interface. Traditionally those sorts of games have not translated well on consoles but now there's a 

whole body of existing and proven casual genre games that can be done by us."<br><br>

<b>Des Hinkson</b> - Senior Designer<br>

"Revolution controller = casual gamer paradise...A lot of people are really intimidated by buttons. Console 

controllers are scary things that make you look dumb if you don't know which button to press. I remember my 

frustration at switching from Nintendo to Sony and having to look for the Triangle button, Circle button, 

etc in Parappa the Rapper and it took time and dedication to feel comfortable with the controller. My wife 

is not a gamer, heck she doesn't even use the TV remote proficiently, preferring to use the numbers instead 

of the channel up and down keys. I think Nintendo have been watching the people who put down the controller 

too quickly and the people who play with their tongues out and tilt their controllers to get that extra bit 

of corning control. Revolution means people can have fun more immediately and we can hook them on that fun 

without the time and dedication needed to learn how to use a traditional controller."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index5">Return to Index Page</a>

<br>It's unknown how Sega will fare now that it has merged with Sammy. However, What we all hope is 

that Sega will remain Sega. Sega has always been a company attracted to innovation and filled with creators 

admired by Nintendo and vice versa. During this generation, Sega has been exceptionally successful on the 

GameCube platform with the releases of Super Monkey Ball, Phantasy Star Online, and Sonic Adventure. (Sonic 

Adventure 2 for GameCube has been Sega's first and only platinum million-selling published title since it 

became a third party publisher). Nintendo also worked closely with Sega's Amusement Vision studio to create 

F-Zero GX. It's very possible future collaborations are in store. Although Sega pulled its sports 

franchises from the GameCube, one hopes they will return with the coming generation and that Sega will make 

apt use of the Wii's capabilities.  Nintendo's Reggie Fils-Aime confirmed the company's support at the February 2006 DICE conference.<br><br>

"I look forward to the 'new kind of fun' that's unique to Nintendo, and I expect that there will be a lot 

of surprises, such as the unannounced controller. It's also great that we'll be able to play Famicom and 

other games via download. I hope Sega games will be playable as well." <br><br>

"The pundits are missing the point when it comes to the Wii's strategy - not every third party is late to the launch. It's true that a lot of third parties have been flat footed when it comes to having games ready for the launch window, but Sega is certainly not one of them. Some third parties have shown a lack of imagination when dealing with this new platform. The way the Wii is being built you have to design for it. Ports and upgrades are no good. That thinking takes a little bit of creativity and not every publisher has the necessary creative people available. I can say without any hesitation that we have a great relationship with Nintendo. The American companies don't do a good enough job of wooing Nintendo. Sega has become a lot closer to Nintendo, which is ironic given the history of the two companies, but that proximity has given us a great view of how they wanted to get out of the polygon race and stop battling the technology companies and instead find a very comfortable position in family-friendly fun games like Super Monkey Ball. We had a Wii room for journalists and analysts and it was the best way to try playable Wii games without getting in the colossal Nintendo line. Those games are built purposely for Wii, That's what makes the Sega story unique - we have family-friendly games with a great Nintendo pedigree - we are one of the few companies that can say we had a great run with GameCube."

Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo. More recently the company has developed the Enter the Matrix licensed

"I've been fielding interview questions on this new Nintendo controller for a while now, and besides the 

obvious stuff, I've been personally hoping for Nintendo to offer custom game interfaces...Meaning when a 

developer designs a game, they can very easily design their own interface at the same time.  Their 

interface component would then (at a very low cost) be included in every game box.   (Imagine a small 

"interface' block that clips in the front of a normal controller.)...The main controller (not looking like 

a remote control) would be designed so you simply plug in the component that came with the game...Nintendo 

talked about controllers having too many buttons and turning off non-gamers...Fair point, but if they 

honestly have a problem with too many buttons, then this solves that too.  For example, on the faceplate 

that comes with a simple game, they could actually get rid of all unused buttons by not replicating them.  

If however I want a more complicated game with 10 buttons and a throttle slider on the faceplate for a Mech 

game, no problem...This solution covers many needs...The faceplate can also contain artwork (for that game) 

and tips, like "FIRE" written under the fire button.  Trust me, that will help newbie gamers!  Can you 

imagine how excited, and then let down I felt when I found out Nintendo nearly delivered this! I feel a lot 

of innovation in the original arcade games was increased by the freedom of designers to create new 

interfaces for their game at the same time.  Think Pacman vs. Tempest vs. Missile Command vs. Star Wars vs. 

Lunar Lander.  All radically different but the interface definitely added to the fun...After toying around 

with this Revolution remote control, and after fighting my grandparents off it, my prediction is that 

people will be looking to buy a "normal" controller to plug in...So thanks Nintendo for trying.  I actually 

respect the effort a lot!  People that know me, know I love big thinking and I LOVE innovation, but I still 

dream of the day when hardware manufactures stop trying to surprise game developers and actually invite a 

group of them to brainstorm on the hardware...It would be a great marketing scoop for them (being designed 

by the top ten game designers in the world), but it would also deliver a bloody cool console / 

controller...Oh well, just five more years and we can try again."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index5">Return to Index Page</a>

"It definitely seems to be beneficial for Nintendo. With Sony and MS both going for the high-powered, third 

party fueled, traditional gaming market, Nintendo needed a really good way to differentiate itself, and boy 

did it find one. It's potentially a good move for some third party developers, as it presents so many new 

gameplay possibilities, and you can get away with lower production costs if the core gameplay is new and 

fun. Good for the industry in general? Of course, how could new and innovative ideas be bad? People still 

have Sony and Microsoft to rely on for the same old, same old, and now they can get something different as 

well."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index5">Return to Index Page</a>

border=0><br>Silicon Knights was once a Nintendo funded studio, but quickly became the last of its 

second-party studios after Nintendo decided that short-term relationship with third-parties was more 

beneficial. After developing Eternal Darkness and then collaboratively developing Metal Gear 

Solid: The Twin Snakes with Konami, Nintendo ended its funding of the studio. SK president Denis Dyack said that it's possible the two companies will still  collaborate in the future on a title-by-title basis. However, the studio currently has no plans to do so, as it is busy developing a title with Sega and the <i>Too Human</i> trilogy for Microsoft's Xbox 360.<br><br>

"On the Revolution...the box looks nice, but theyve shown no specs, so the jury is still out on that one 

till next year. I really cant even guess, with the Sony PS3, and Microsoft Xbox 360, the specs are very 

comparable; my guess is the average consumer wont be able to tell the difference between those two 

systems. I think theyre virtually identical. With the Revolution, depending on what the specs are, if they 

come out with similar specs, itll probably be the same with them. I really hoped to see the controller, 

next year though. I really liked the design though, it was pretty sleek."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index5">Return to Index Page</a>
