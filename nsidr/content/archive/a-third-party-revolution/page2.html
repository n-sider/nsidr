<br>Activision is known for its Tony Hawk and Spider-Man licensed games. The publisher has put heavy support behind all of Nintendo's consoles in the past, so there's no reason to think differently in regard to its Wii support. Activision is very platform agnostic and instead tends to develop its titles for multiplatform release. We expect this strategy to continue in the future. The company has several appealing franchises including the GTA-like True Crime and war-hero series Call of Duty. <br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Chuck Huebner</b> - President Worldwide Studios<br>
<i>Sept. 18, 2005</i><br>
"What we're seeing from this controller is the same thing we saw with Nintendo DS.  It's a system that's designed with an eye on enticing new players to the video game industry, and that's something we firmly support." <br><br>

<b>Robert Kotick</b> - CEO<br>
<i>Sep. 14, 2006</i><br>
"The Wii is changing audience interaction, opening up whole new experiences that have never been possible in video games. With the instinctual control of the Wii Remote, Nintendo is advancing the gaming experience to the broadest audience of gamers. Activision is excited about the launch of the Wii and the opportunity it offers. So much so, we plan to have five titles available at launch - our strongest lineup ever for a new console. We have more development resources devoted to the Wii than to any previous Nintendo platform. The Wii is likely to have a profound impact on the size, growth and overall opportunities for the video game market."<br>
<i>Aug. 4, 2005</i><br>
"It sounds like [our competitors] may be trying to catch up with plans that we've already put into place. We're encouraged by the Wii platform. We have three launch titles planned for it this year. We'll see how the market responds to it. But it has tremendous potential to broaden the market and we've got a whole solid plan against the Wii in the future. (In regards to pricing) We think premium content generates premium pricing, and Wii pricing will be at least $49."<br><br>

<b>Alex Neuse</b><br>
<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>
"While I too was surprised when I first saw the controller, I do believe that the move is beneficial for Nintendo, 3rd parties, and the industry. While I can't say whether anyone will benefit financially, I believe that the current state of the industry could use some innovation like Nintendo is offering with 

this new controller. Nintendo is going out on a limb to offer the industry a tool that can potentially 

revolutionize games. Whether 3rd parties support this move or not is really up to them. I would leave you 

with this thought though: When Nintendo created the gamepad it was adopted as the norm; when they created 

the analog stick it was adopted as the norm; when they created rumble it was adopted as the norm. Their 

track record is strong. I hope that this new controller allows developers to offer gamers new and unique 

ways to interface with the medium."<br><br>

<b>Steve Pearce</b> - Vice President of Technology<br>
<i>Dec. 15, 2005</i><br>
"Anyone present at Iwata-san's unveiling of the controller at TGS has imagined what future visions of 

Nintendo classics will be like. Envisioning Link's spin attack, Mario's triple jump and Samus' gunplay on 

Revolution is an intriguing exercise. Similarly, the Activision design teams are creatively charged as they 

determine how the controller can best be used on our titles. How will Spider-Man's Revolution webs be cast, 

Tony Hawk's deck be flipped and Call of Duty grenades be thrown?"<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index1">Return to Index Page</a>

"The new revolution controller is Nintendo's way of saying "without this, the new system will be the same 

as the old system", which is reasonably true of all the next-gen systems. It is however, a very good idea, 

if not just for Nintendo, then for the industry in general. Why? Simple, remember 1980? The game 

development market crashed because we stayed too long at the same level of technology and games didn't 

really get any different. The past few years we have had increasing technology -- but as a consumer we're 

not really able to see it. All the games look just the same. This new twist will revive all the gamers who 

stopped playing because everything's exactly the same as it used to be, and is going to be really good for 

the industry."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index1">Return to Index Page</a>

I think the games produced by Nintendo will be worth the price of admission. I do have concerns as a 

developer. If the Revolution doesn't offer a large enough install base, it will be a tough sell for 

companies to focus their development efforts on a single platform. If we come up with a game idea 

specifically for the Revolution that is just too fun to pass up, I'm sure we'll do it. The other scenario 

is the Revolution will get a port of a game that works on the other consoles as well. I think they are 

already keeping an open mind and holding the door open for new ideas, so that is great. It could definitely 

benefit Nintendo to establish the Revolution as something that doesn't compete with the Xbox 360 and PS3, 

but is rather in a realm of its own and a required purchase for every gamer because the experience is that 

unique."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index1">Return to Index Page</a>

We know far too little about the machine itself in order to make a judgement call. Possession demands some hefty console power. We know that PS3 and 360 can deliver that. The main question arises as to whether the Wii offers the same degree of power. Plus the controller does raise a few issues with respect to the Possession control system, which whilst very feasible with PS3 and 360 controllers? possibly questions the viability of Possession using the Revolution controller."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index1">Return to Index Page</a>

<br><IMG src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/partnerships-capcom.jpg" border=0><br>A press 

conference held in Japan on Sept. 11, 2002, set the stage for the news, in which respected game designers 

Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Capcom's Shinji Mikami shook hands during an announcement that floored the 

gaming community. At the conference, Capcom pledged its Resident Evil series to be a GameCube exclusive and 

announced several new franchises that would hit the GCN in the coming years. As a result of the 

partnership, remakes of Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, 

Resident Evil: Code Veronica, and Resident Evil 4 were all released exclusively on the GameCube. In 

addition, several other projects including Product Number 03, Viewtiful Joe, and Killer 7 were lined up for 

a GameCube release. Nintendo and Capcom clearly have a very close relationship as the companies also worked 

together on the Zelda Game Boy titles and even the most recent Kirby title for GBA, Kirby & The Amazing 

Mirror. Capcom has several high-profiles series under its belt, with the most well-known being Resident 

Evil, Devil May Cry, Mega Man, and Street Fighter.  Nintendo's Reggie Fils-Aime confirmed the company's support at the February 2006 DICE conference.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Minoru Nakai</b> - Producer (Resident Evil DS)<br>

<i>Jan. 17, 2005</i><br>
"It's certain that the controller is the keypoint in the concept of the Revolution.  The real question is: 

should we change the RE-formula again so we can use the Revolution-controller with all its new functions? 

We just re-invented Resident Evil with RE4, in which we changed the camera view to behind the character to 

provide a more action-orientated experience and provide a new intensity of gameplay. While I still love the 

gameplay RE4 provides, we would really love to exploit the new possibilities when the gamers are tired of 

the current gameplay. So I think it may be best for us to first make a non-RE game for the Revolution first 

before we change the formula (literal: attack the series) and so, we can also get used to the new concept 

of the controller. We're working on it this moment."<br><br>

<b>Takeshi Horinouchi</b> - Assistant Producer (MegaMan Battle)<br>
<i>Feb. 07, 2006</i><br>
"I indeed had the chance to quickly test Revolution, and I must say that it is interesting to note the evolution in this field. The perception of the video game is completely new. Concerning Megaman, we do not know yet what the future holds for us, but I would very much like to use the concept of Nintendo Revolution to see what a Megaman game could be on this console."<br><br>

<b>Keiji Inafune</b> - Director (Mega Man)<br>
<i>May 16, 2006</i><br>
"However, the Wii definitely has some potential, and it's maybe one where our target audience could embrace the Mega Man series. So while we haven't planned anything specific now at this time, I think probably that the potential is the highest on that piece of hardware."<br><br>

<br>A very small development group consisting of six people as of November 2005.  The

<blockquote>
<b>Geremy Mustard</b> - Co-Founder (Advent Rising)<br>
<i>Nov. 26, 2005</i><br>
The Revolution will be much more powerful than the GameCube. I think people will be surprised at how many 

games will continue to be made across all three consoles. Game developers are becoming better at making 

their engines scalable, so that they can easily downsize textures, reformat audio, etc, so games can still 

be made to look pretty on some systems yet still play well on less capable ones. I think we will see a lot 

of innovation on the Revolution if Nintendo creates a flexible price point for smaller games. It seems to 

me that it wouldn't be too hard or expensive for Nintendo to support HDTV output. That would at least allow 

the developers to make up their own minds about whether their game can support it or not. It should be the 

choice of the developer, though, and Nintendo should support HDTV output on the 

Revolution.<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index1">Return to Index Page</a>

Colin Mcrae Rally series as well as sports games.  N-Sider reader James Harvey recalls, "Two guys from Codemasters - animators - came to lecture at our university, UWCN in Newport Wales. Someone asked if they had any games in the pipeline for the Wii; they said no. I asked why not and they said 'that's a very good question'."<br><br>

an extension of the player...it should also inspire creators to explore innovation and bring back bored
