"I think that Nintendo has just designed the controllers for the generation after the one that is upon us. 

The biggest problem with the next generation is that there is really no difference between the Xbox 360 and 

the PS3. Both consoles are going to have gorgeous graphics, online options and the like. If Nintendo went 

the usual, typical route, then we would be looking at three consoles that are too similar. With their new 

controller, Nintendo has given us something distinctive, something that is unique. They have given us 

something that is not quite what you expected and a reason to look forward to the next gen. I know what I'm 

getting when I play with a 360 controller or a PS3 controller. There are no real surprises there. That's 

not a bad thing but it also doesn't really excite me about the experience. The Metroid Prime demo really 

blew me away when I read the impressions. I think that dual analog control schemes for FPS are loony 

compared to mouse-look setups. The NDS is the only other real option for accurate FPS controls outside of a 

PC. The Revolution controller offers a potential option outside of the PC as well as a potentially good use 

of light gun schemes, steering wheel set ups, mouse-like selection and management in strategy games...the 

possibilities are there. I think Nintendo is on the right track by trying to do something different. If 

they tried to fight the good fight between Sony and Microsoft, they would lose horribly. Even if Nintendo 

secured great third party support, branding would work against them since most of the core demograph would 

get theirs on 360 or PS3 first anyway. Nintendo needed to get creative to bring something new to the fold, 

while keeping their fanbase and pushing the industry. I say, "Well done! Show me the actual Revolution and 

some games Nintendo. Now, you have my attention."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index6">Return to Index Page</a>

"The obvious answer is first-person shooters, but I think that the question almost misses the point.

To me, the promise of the new controller is that it allows new types of games. The question that should be asked is not "How can we do what we've been doing on this controller?" but rather "What does this controller allow that was not possible or not elegant previously?" Much like the DS games that would not have been enjoyable on any other system, I'm looking forward to the games that can only exist on Revolution."<br><br>

"I'm sympathetic for Nintendo's stance of reducing hurdles for games. For that reason, I think it's good 

that the controller buttons have been reduced to just one. A long remote controller shape with just one 

button. This has impact. The DS, with its touch screen, made games a ways easier to understand. However, 

with the D-pad and buttons, and also the touch panel, controls actually became more complicated. I think it

border=0><br>On the original Nintendo and Super Nintendo, Square and Enix were Nintendo's largest 

supporters. That is of course, until the less-costly and more freedom allowing disc-media of the 

PlayStation appeared. The two companies departed from Nintendo which led Yamauchi and Square in particular 

to have a distaste for each other. Fortunately, with the GameCube, the relationship with Square has been 

repaired. The two companies, courtesy of Yamauchi's personal Fund Q, have brought such titles as Final 

Fantasy Tactics Advance and Sword of Mana to the Game Boy Advance as well as Final Fantasy: Crystal 

Chronicles to the GameCube. Square Enix is the ultimate RPG publisher in the world with such series as 

Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Seiken Densetsu, and much more. Having its support is 

vital in the Japanese market. The studio has confirmed that they are in development with Final Fantasy: 

Crystal Chronicles for the Wii.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Yoshinori Kitase</b> - Producer (Final Fantasy VII)<br>
<i>Oct. 26, 2005</i><br>
Kitase reveals that he loves to go home after a long day's work, lay down, pick up the television remote 

with one hand and flip channels on the television. Games require him to move and hold the controller with 

both hands, and for first-person shooters, things get even worse, as he's required to set up a table, mouse 

and keyboard. Kitase believes that the Revolution controller will allow people to play while laying down, 

using the controller to shoot things and wield guns. More strikingly, he states that the Revolution 

controller doesn't just change the content of a game, but the lifestyle of its players.<br><br>

<b>Kouichi Ishii</b> - Producer (World of Mana)<br>

<i>Dec. 15, 2005</i><br>
"It'd be a shame if developers only transferred existing games to this system. They've got to envision a 

more creative route then buckle up for a wild ride."<br>
<i>Sept. 18, 2005</i><br>
I believe creators will enjoy making games [with the controller]. You'll have to change game design 

methods from the core. For instance, you'll have to start by looking back at your play as a kid and think 

of what kinds of things you could do if developing for the Revolution. If you can do this, then surely you 

will be able to make a completely new form of play, different from current games."<br><br>

<b>Yuji Horii</b> - Designer (Dragon Quest)<br>
<i>Jan. 13, 2006</i><br>
"When I was making Manga, I met up with the technology of computer games," he told journalists. "I loved 

the fact that it was interactive, that you do something and you get feedback. I thought that an interactive 

story where you get feedback and rewards from everything that you do would be interesting. I like the idea 

of interactivity with the hardware, so there, where you mention the Nintendo controller, it's a new 

interface, and it's exciting to have that reaction. You do something, and it reacts to you. It's human 

nature that to have some feedback from your actions it rewarding."<br>

<i>Sept. 18, 2005</i><br>
"At first introduction to the controller, I was surprised. There should have been a controller like this 

before, but surprisingly, there was not. I believe people will not hesitate to use this controller. Just 

like a remote control for your TV, people touch it without understanding how to use it. Starting with DS, I 

believe Nintendo has made game machines that are for the feeling of touch. The Revolution controller has 

evolved this feeling of touch even farther."<br><br> 

<b>Akitori Kawazu</b> - Producer (Final Fantasy XII)<br>
<i>Sept. 18, 2005</i><br>
"The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Controlling with one hand? Wow, that's a bold approach.' It's 

great to see the movements of your hands and arms, especially the subtle action twist reflected on the 

strain the physical feeling you get; it's not what I expected. I believe this will challenge us as 

creators, to figure out how we are going to utilize this fundamental change."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index6">Return to Index Page</a>

will help usher in a new generation of game design, I think the Revolution has a better chance of 

succeeding than most analysts and critics believe. The combination of their "motion centric" controller, 

deep catalog of content spanning 20+ years and kick ass next generation games, puts Nintendo is in the best 

position to broaden the market and bring those gamers, who stopped playing, back to the television with 

their family in tow.  I want to thank Nintendo for not maintaining the status quo, for constantly pushing

"With escalating costs for both developing games and for consumers buying new game systems, we applaud Nintendo's drive to spread gaming to the masses - and we fully support that approach."<br>
<i>Jul. 17, 2006</i><br>
"We love the Wii - it's all about having fun, right? Games are about having fun and sometimes this industry takes itself a bit too seriously. A lot of our properties, like Cars and Spongebob and others, really map well... Potentially even wrestling - I can think of a lot of great things to do with the controller for that product as well."<br>
<i>Sept. 18, 2005</i><br>
"Nintendo has long been a trailblazer, and this controller design reinforces that reputation.  We 

enthusiastically support Nintendo's next console because we believe their approach of continual innovation 

is very much in line with our own strategy of creating unique and innovative games for the next generation 

of hardware." <br><br>

"When we first watched it, we thought, frankly, 'what the hell is this?'.  The main thing is getting it in 

your hands. Once you do that, it's pretty intuitive. It's not about more buttons. It's about ease of use 

for consumers...I'm surprised and happy with the direction Nintendo is going."<br>
<i>Dec. 15, 2005</i><br>
"Think about how many players you know that move controllers upward when pressing the jump button or turn 

it while steering in a racing game. With Revolution, these movements can be made to affect gameplay. Any 

genre that's suffered from traditional controller limitations stands to initially benefit the most, 

particularly ones with too many complex button combinations. Also, mouse-oriented PC genres (RTS, adventure 

games) could become much more console-friendly with the Revolution controller."<br>
<i>Dec. 8, 2005</i><br>
"Within a matter of weeks we had literally dozens if not well over a hundred kinds of play patterns that 

could be done with the controller,  There's almost too much that people can think of, which is a sign that 

it's inspirational..."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index6">Return to Index Page</a>

<BR>Throwback Entertainment is based in Toronto, Canada, and was founded in 2004. The company purchased several franchises from the bankrupt publisher Acclaim Entertainment, including games such as Re-Volt, Extreme-G, Gladiator: Sword of Vengeance, and Vexx.<br><br>

<blockquote>
<b>Thomas Maduri</b> - CEO<br>
<i>Jul. 10, 2006</i><br>
"I think a fundamental problem Acclaim had with
many of these franchises is there weren't services
like Xbox Live Arcade, or non-traditional platforms
like Nintendo is providing with the DS, and [the]
anticipated Wii console, available to them when many
of these games were created. A game like Re-Volt or
Iggy's Reckin' Balls would be a perfect fit for the
Xbox Live Arcade service. They provide quick gameplay,
and do not possess a substantial learning curve for
the controls. These services will create new markets
using existing console technology, so in that sense
they will be console-based, but in a non-mainstream
format. Throwback is planning on taking advantage of
those and any other yet-to-be-announced platforms or
services we could potentially benefit from."<br><br>

"Nintendo has always prided itself on innovation and this controller is no exception.  I think this move by 

Nintendo will secure them the uniqueness they seek.  The only way that a new console will succeed is if 

they have third party publisher support.  My only concern is that developers and publishers may have a 

difficult time in developing software for a single platform (which this controller ultimately forces them 

to do).  Many publishers rely on multiple platform products in order to make the next gen console leap.  It 

will be interesting to see how much support the Revolution gets compared to the PS3, 360, PC, and let's not 

forget the current systems which will still have at least two years of life left in 

them."<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index6">Return to Index Page</a>

"The Wii control scheme opens up unexplored areas for our talented teams to innovate when creating games. It's invigorating for us. We believe that it will help create a new level of interest in video games and engage more players around the world."<br><br>

<i>Sept. 19, 2005</i><br>
"I feel just like a child with a new toy, opening millions of new doors of possibilities. More than an 

improvement, this way of playing is creating a new dimension. Its simple, when Nintendo unveils its 

hardware, every member of the team starts imagining crazy ideas. Its opening their minds. The fact of 

adding 3D gestures as the way of communicating with the game is just the perfect kind of innovation that 

can bring new games to new gamers. To me, it can bring the consoles what the mouse brought to the PC at its 

time. It's a 3D pointer with rotation information! Now, you're going to handle virtual objects, make 

recognition signs. Its closer to the way we act in real world, thats why its going to be mass market. 

Im sure that people will go crazy given the ability to interact so easily with virtual worlds. Im just 

mad about it!"<br><br>

<b>Carlo Delallana</b><br>
<i>Sept. 28, 2005</i><br>
"This new control system really differentiates Nintendo from its competition and should allow them to 

position the Revolution in the marketplace very clearly. IDG did a study that shows that more households 

will go multiconsole when the next-gen systems hit. Gamers may consider the Revolution as a good companion 

system to their more mainstream consoles (Xbox 360 or PS3). There's a lot of potential with the controller 

as far as game design, I'm sure designers all over the world are probably thinking of ways to exploit this 

technology. We could see some really amazing games and possibly new game genres making its debut on the 

Revolution. How much support the Revolution gets is entirely up to Nintendo. Software sells hardware and 

the launch line-up for the Revolution and clever marketing from Nintendo will determine if this gamble pays 

off. This is a chance for developers to break out of the mold of "formulaic game design" and really explore 

what games can be, possibly expanding the audience at the same time."<br><br>

<b>Nicholas Eypert</b> - Creative Director<br>
<i>Dec. 15, 2005</i><br>
"The Revolution controller breaks the 'push button' experience of other platforms, where the player must go 

through an abstract action--pushing a button--to complete an action. With the Revolution, the action is 

completely natural and physical. We can propose new types of interactions that are easy and fun, as they 

rely on a simple gesture. We can translate into video game interactions all the tools you manipulate with 

your hand: the sculptor's tool, the doctor's scalpel, the fireman's hose...imagine you are a doctor curing 

patients or an architect who builds his own house! It opens up so many possibilities that we already have 

too many ideas. All the designers that I've spoken with at Ubisoft are buzzing with amazing ideas."<br><br>

<b>Yves Guillemot</b> - CEO<br>
<i>Jan. 1, 2006</i><br>
"We think September could be the right time for Sony in the US and November in Europe.  Japan a bit 

earlier, say June or July." He expects Nintendo to aim for a similar launch date in the US and Japan, but 

fears that Europe might have to wait for the Revolution until early 2007.<br><br>

<b>Serge Hascoet</b> - Chief Creative Officer<br>

<i>Nov. 26, 2005</i><br>
For developers, programming the controller shouldn't be all that challenging. Now, coming up with a great 

game design -- that will be challenging! I think what Nintendo is going after is giving players new kinds 

of game experiences -- not just the same old with better graphics. I think you are going to see some 

established franchises appear on the Revolution that are going to be genius on the platform. Of course the 

game won't be exactly the same game as [it would be on] PS3 or Xbox 360 -- but really, what's the point in 

that? I think we all need to widen the lens and not see the next generation of consoles being direct 

competitors of each other. Stop comparing hardware specs and who's got the bigger CPU. Just give me some 

good games with more innovation in game design...dammit! Much like the DS, I think people are 

underestimating what the system is capable of. We all know that [Nintendo] will produce one or two killer 

titles at or near launch for the system. But it's a strong third-party portfolio that will be the key to 

success. I believe Nintendo is well aware of this and it will be interesting to see how the launch lineup 

unfolds for Revolution.<br><br></blockquote><br><a href="articleview.php?articleid=497&page=1#index6">Return to Index Page</a>
