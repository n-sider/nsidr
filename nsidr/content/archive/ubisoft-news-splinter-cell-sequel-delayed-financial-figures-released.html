<p>Ubisoft announced today that the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions of <i>Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow</i> have been delayed. According to Ubisoft, the reason for the delay is so that the PS2 and GCN versions of the game are as good as their Xbox counterpart. The GBA, PC, Mobile Phone, and Xbox versions of the game are still slated for release next month. 

<p>Ubisoft has also issued its third quarter financial results. According to the report, the company experienced a 42 percent growth in the United States, placing it seventh among publishers in North America. Interestingly, sales of <i>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</i> (over all three major platforms) have topped two million units in Europe, helping to place Ubisoft as the number two publisher in the United Kingdom. Despite numerous positive reviews and much industry hype, <i>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</i> failed to make much of an impact in North America this holiday season. The title barely managed to sell half a million units over all three platforms.
