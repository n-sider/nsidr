There's some good news as well as bad news that comes along with Nintendo of America's recent list of scheduled software releases.  The first is that Metroid Prime Pinball for the Nintendo DS is arriving sooner than expected on October 24 (in addition, it has been confirmed that the game will include a rumble pak).  On the other hand, <i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i> for the Nintendo DS has been delayed to the first quarter of 2006 (no reason for the delay was specified however many speculate Nintendo may allow the title to take advantage of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service).  The rest of the Nintendo DS software lineup is as follows:
