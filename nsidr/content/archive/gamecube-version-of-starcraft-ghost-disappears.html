<P><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/6137109?part=rss&tag=gs_news&subj=6137109">Gamespot</a> is reporting that the oft-delayed and much-anticipated GameCube version of Starcraft: Ghost is no more.</P>

<P>Reportedly, a Blizzard representative stated that the game will be releasing on PS2 and Xbox platforms only, due to the GameCube's lack of online support.  Said the rep:</P>
<P><i> "In order to provide the game envisioned by the console team, a set and readily available online solution was needed.  Unfortunately the GameCube has no online service and since so much work is going in to the online portion, it would be additional work to release only part of the intended game."</i></P>
<P>More information on how it requires more work to release less game forthcoming.</P>
