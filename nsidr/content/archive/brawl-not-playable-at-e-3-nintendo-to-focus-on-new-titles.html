The rumors have been stewing for a little while, but last night Wired's Chris Kohler confirmed it: his PR contact for Nintendo told him outright that highly-anticipated Wii sequel <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/07/nintendo-smash-.html">will not be playable</a> at next week's E3 show.<br />
<br />
The announcement comes in light of Nintendo's desire to focus their E3 showing on yet-unannounced software, including several never-before-seen Wii titles.  The smaller showing is due in part to the smaller and more tightly-scheduled nature of this year's show; Chris cites his own limitation of 55 minutes of time with Nintendo's offerings as evidence of this.<br />
<br />
E3 kicks off with Microsoft's press conference a mere seven days from now.  N-Sider will be there and we'll be trying to squeeze as much out of our own tiny blocks of time as we can for you.  Hope to see you here!
