<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3466-1.jpg" width="200" height="125" class="image_styled" /></div>Nintendo of Europe announced today plans to sell <a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/news/article.do?elementId=-5hVXQrFHheA4rpnTVDYgnBO1ZneifQx">a "Platinum" version</a> of the DS Lite, which looks quite a bit like Japan's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2810">Gloss Silver version</a>.  Touted inexplicably as "the perfect accessory whatever you are wearing", the new color goes on sale October 12 for either about Â£100 or about â‚¬150, depending on the prevalent currency in the country you're buying it in.
