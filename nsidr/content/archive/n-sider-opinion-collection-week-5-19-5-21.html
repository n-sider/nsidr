<h3>N-Sider Opinion Collection: Week [5.19] - [5.21]</h3>

<p>I'm creating this for those of you reluctant or simply without the time to scavenge the internet for reading material.  These are editorial and other opinion pieces for a particular week that, in a way, reflect the current discussion of the gaming industry.  While N-Sider doesn't necessarily share the opinions of the included pieces, we found them to be informative and possibly of interest to you.  Be sure to click on the links to be forwarded to the full articles.

<p>One of the best editorials I've read in some time comes from N-Philes.com titled <a href="http://www.n-philes.com/php/epvflpveuyekkulyeeu.php">Nintendo Fans Who Don't Care</a>.  The author confronts the issues of GameCube and Game Boy Advance users buying mainly Nintendo published software.  The reason third-party games do so well on PlayStation 2 and Xbox is because they don't have a Nintendo to overshadow all the other titles that are available.  The article brings up another good point on how news organizations focus on Nintendo's games and miss the stories about companies and games that matter but aren't huge (ex. sleepers hits such as <i>Denki Blocks</i> for GBA).  It's the realization - that the GameCube will only see success when Nintendo's first party titles stop being the lifeblood of the console - which is most profound.

<p>Also on N-Philes.com is an article titled <a href="http://www.n-philes.com/php/epvfllvuleeupezyfpep.php">Nintendo 2003: An Australian Perspective</a>, which adresses many of the same issues however focuses more on the Australian market.  The article examines the current state of the Australian video game market, and more specifically Nintendo's miniscule presence.  It doesn't sound like Nintendo and its GameCube is doing well in the land down under.  The author addresses the issue of Australian Nintendo fans buying only Nintendo published software, video game piracy, and Nintendo's overall perception by Australian gamers as a child's machine.

<p>Since we're speaking about news on a worldwide basis, I read an interesting article recently at GameIndustry.biz titled <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=pub&aid=1692">Reporters Without Borders Slams E3 Deportations</a>.  The article details some of the issues foreign journalists endured on their visit to the United States for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo.  Over ten journalists were deported back to their countries for not carrying visas.  There's really no need to place blame on anyone for this situation - whether it be <i>"the journalist should have done prior research"</i> or <i>"the IDSA should have informed them of the required papers"</i> - but rather, to simply get this information out there.  Whatever the case is, here's a heads up.  Under new anti-terror laws, foreign journalists are required to carry visas.

<p>Regarding E3, there were a signifcant amount of articles inspired by the show.  One of the most notable editorials I read was from GamerFeed.com titled <a href="http://www.gamerfeed.com/index.php?ftrid=87">Console Clones Wars</a>.  The author of the article presents the issues of game publishers relying on sequels and upgrades to existing video games.  He goes on to say that "a line must be drawn and new ideas need to be adoringly bred and cautiously nurtured so that they too, may become a part of the great gaming industry and win our hearts over as Mario did twenty years ago".  I think the article speaks the truth.  It is something IDSA president, Doug Lowenstein, also acknowledged.  This E3 show was blatantly about the sequels and as a result, many fear the industry is becoming stagnant.

<p>In a similar editorial on GamerFeed.com titled <a href="http://www.gamerfeed.com/index.php?ftrid=86">Traversing The Modern Trends Of Gaming</a>, the author discusses how developers are using old ideas and implementing them alongside new ones.  The article examines some of the trends today including cel-shading, military games, and the resurgence of the handheld.

<p>One of the most talked about topics at E3 was the announcement that Sony was developing a handheld console called the PSP.  CNNMoney published an editorial called <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/22/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm">Game Boy Gears for a Fight</a> which addresses some of the competitors Nintendo's Game Boy Advance will be facing in the coming years.  The article even offers some speculation from analysts on prices for Sony's handheld and Tapwave's Helix.  The article looks at how similar but also contrasting handheld devices such as Nokia's N-Gage could grab some of the Game Boy's market.

<p>Another post-E3 conversation people have been having is about Nintendo of America's E3 showing.  Cube-Europe.com examined Nintendo's showing in an article titled <a href="http://www.cube-europe.com/news.php?nid=4590">Evaluating Three E`s</a>.  Many online gamers have conveyed complaints about Nintendo's focus on GBA/GCN connectivity, lack of new and original games and also - coming out of E3 2002 with <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> and <i>Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> - the absence of big franchise titles.

<p>On a less serious tone, comes an <a href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/specials.cfm?action=profile&id=454">Interview with Denis Dyack</a> from PlanetGameCube.com.  As president of Nintendo second-party developer Silicon Knights, Denis has a lot of information to divulge on current happenings within Nintendo as well as his collaboration with Konami for the video game <i>Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes</i>.  Some points of interest include (1) the fact that Miyamoto is working closely in the development of Metal Gear, (2) Dyack's comments supporting Nintendo's choice to take online gaming cautiously, and (3) the pace at which Hideo Kojima and Nintendo offered Silicon Knights the opportunity to develop Metal Gear and Dyack's acceptance.

<p>Moving away from E3, I recently read an article at NintendoInsider.com titled <a href="http://nintendoinsider.com/site/EpVFulEVlkTMhxIQiV.php">Dreaming Of The Next Zelda</a>.  The author of the article details many of the gameplay elements he would like to see in the next 3D <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.  He imagines an Hyrule overworld that "will sport lush and sometimes dark and shady forests, beautiful lakes and maybe an ocean with a beach and sand, tall mountains, coated in fresh powdery snow, a molten lake filled with lava at the top of a Volcano".  The article gives a great sense of imagination and an opportunity to use your own.
