In a story from before the Wii's launch this past sunday, Nintendo of America president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> said he expected to sell 2 million units of Nintendo's new Wii console in North America before the second week in January.<br />
<br />
Fils-Aime also said he expects a 4-6 year lifespan for the console, and hopes to sell 1 million Wiis by early December.  Wii-watchers will recall that Nintendo previously said it expected to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2453">have that many</a> for launch, and if reports coming in reflecting near-universal sold-out inventories on launch day are anything to go by, Nintendo may well have accomplished that goal&mdash;if, in fact, they actually managed to ship a million units.
