<p><b>Story</b></p>

<blockquote><p>The story takes place on the continent of Telius, which is composed of several kingdoms, each of which possess their own influence.</p>

<p>Near the border of these countries, a mercenary team establishes its headquarters.</p>

<p>Princess of the Crimea Kingdom flees from her country and requests Ike's help.  The Crimea Kingdom was invaded by the Dayne Kingdom and left very weak.  The Princess of the Crimea Kingdom hires Ike and his mercenary team to escort her to the Gaul Kingdom.  The group encounters all sorts of monsters and beasts along the way.</p>

<p>A friend of the Crimea Kingdom, the Gaul Kingdom agrees to wage war with the Dayne Kingdom.</p>

<p>Developed by Intelligent Systems, Fire Emblem: Souen no Kiseki (translated literally to "the green locus of the flame") is scheduled for a winter release in Japan.</p>
