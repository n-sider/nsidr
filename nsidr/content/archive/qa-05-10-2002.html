Hey guys,
I was reading how the N-Sider website was non-profit, and I got an idea. Assuming you guys are going to E3, why don't you tape the event and sell it for an affordable price (a la Planet GameCube)? There is a fairly large demand for these tapes and DVDs, and it would no doubt allow you to do more things with your site.

I was thinking about getting my cube modded and import some of the great Japanese games, such as Animal Leader, Doshin (if it doesn't come over) and possibly Rave.  However, before I do I would like some kind of base in the Japanese language.  I know that it's fairly complicated, and there are many different styles, so is there a recommended tape, book, or other thing that can help you to learn Japanese? Yeah, Thanks.

The Australian launch is iminent and yet nintendo is still pushing Luigi's mansion as the flagship tittle.  Why, and why is SSBM and Pikmin still coming out weeks after the launch?</br>
Seems stupid to me.

1. Please could you tell me how long the flex is going to be on the Game Cube joypad (UK version).</br>
2. Please could you confirm for me whether or not the Game Cube will come with an RGB Compliant SCART Lead</br>
3. Please could you confirm the price of games for the Game Cube, in the UK.</br>

According to rumors, Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Japan were going to team up for the next Smash Brothers
game by listening to players thoughts and making suggestions.
Is this true or is this just a bunch of lousy peice of crap by the players.

Wanted to tell you I read your recent Nintendo FAQ on nintendo's internal and 1st-party teams, and I have to say it revealed a *lot* I didn't know. what I'd like to know, however, is what position is Browny Brown in? Are they a first party, completely owned by a Nintendo, a 2nd-party, or a loyal 3rd-party, like Camelot or Factor 5? Also, isn't Retro now a first-party?
