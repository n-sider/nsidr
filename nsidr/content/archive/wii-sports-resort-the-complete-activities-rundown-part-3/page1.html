We've taken you on a tour of the first eight sports of <i>Wii Sports Resort</i> over the course of the last two days, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/wii-sports-resort-the-complete-activities-rundown">starting with</a> Swordplay, Wakeboarding, Frisbee and Archery and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/wii-sports-resort-the-complete-activities-rundown-part-2">moving on</a> to Basketball, Table Tennis, Golf, and Bowling.<br />
<br />
Today we'll run you through the last four events, including one of my favorites, the delightful Air Sports mode.  Enjoy, and come back for our full review tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<a name="powercruising"></a><div class="header">Power Cruising</div><br />
With a Nunchuk in your left hand and a sideways-held Wii Remote in your right, as if you were holding the handlebars of a jet ski, steer your way through rings as quickly as possible.  Steering's done by tilting both hands back and forth as if they were both on said set of handlebars.<br />
<br />
You won't move unless you're holding down the A button.  Twisting both your wrists toward you will give the jet ski a boost, which you can only do when your boost meter fills&mdash;this only takes a couple of seconds, so you can pretty much boost the entire course if you're quick about it.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Slalom Course</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (alternating)<br />
<br />
In this mode, you're racing against the individual clocks on each ring, which count down from 9.9 to 1.0&mdash;whatever the clock displays when you make it through is how many points you are awarded.  Some rings have smaller bonus rings mounted inside that, if you drive through them, give you double points.<br />

<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Ringmaster: Go through every bonus ring on one course.</li>
  <li>5,000-pointer: Get a cumulative score of 5,000 or more points overall.</li>
  <li>Power Cruiser: Score 170 points or more on all courses.</li>
  <li>Power Jumper: Go through all the bonus rings in the final course.</li>
  <li>Leisure Cruiser: Find all the time balloons in one run in the single-player Free-Cruising mode, then run the Slalom Course.</li>
  </ul><br />
<div class="subheader">VS</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 2 (simultaneous)<br />
<br />
Race on one of six courses in split-screen mode, going through every ring in the proper order.<br />

<br />
<a name="canoeing"></a><div class="header">Canoeing</div><br />
This very physical game turns the Wii Remote into the handle of a canoe paddle.  Hold it vertically, then tilt it to the left or to the right (depending on which side of your canoe you want to paddle on) and make sweeping motions to paddle.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Speed Challenge</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 1-4 (co-op)<br />
<br />
Up to four players can all paddle the same canoe in the three difficulty levels of this mode (or at least so I assume, as I only have two MotionPlus units to test with), trying to get to the goal before time runs out.  Each time you make it, you'll be able to try again with the goal set a little further.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3936-3.jpg" width="445" height="250" class="image_styled" /></div><br />
<b>Stamps:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Beginner License: Get to 200 yards in the Beginner level.</li>
  <li>Intermediate License: Get to 300 yards in the Intermediate level.</li>
  <li>Expert License: Get to 400 yards in the Expert level.</li>
  <li>Ducks in a Row: In Free Practice mode, find all the stray ducklings on the lake and lead them back to their mother, then complete the course afterward.</li>
  <li>Cut the Red Tape: Cut the red tape in all levels, which is found past the License marks.</li>
  </ul><br />
<div class="subheader">VS</div><br />
<b>Players:</b> 2-4 (simultaneous)<br />
<br />
The first player to pass each checkpoint scores a point.  Score five points to win.<br />
