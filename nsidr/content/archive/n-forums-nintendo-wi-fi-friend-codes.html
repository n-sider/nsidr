<p>Well, fancy that.  We have a cool new feature in our forums that congregates all the Wi-Fi Connection codes for your fellow N-Siders.  We've titled the page <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/nintendowifi.php">N-Forums Nintendo Wi-Fi Friend Codes</a>.  For convenience, you can sort by game which so far includes Mark Kart DS, Animal Crossing: Wild World, Tetris DS, and Metroid Prime Hunters.  A nifty feature we hope you'll enjoy.</p>
