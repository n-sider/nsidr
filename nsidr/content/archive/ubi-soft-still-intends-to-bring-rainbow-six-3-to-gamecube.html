<p>Ubi Soft sent out a press release informing us that <i>Tom Clancys Rainbow Six 3</i> is still scheduled for release on the Nintendo GameCube.  It's being prepared for a June 2004 North American debut.</p>

<p>Although it should come as no surprise, it's been confirmed that the GameCube version of Rainbow Six 3 will forego the online game components featured in the game for other platforms.  A two-player split-screen mode however, will be available.</p>
