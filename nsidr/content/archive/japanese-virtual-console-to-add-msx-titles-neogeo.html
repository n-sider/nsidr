The Japanese Virtual Console just <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2007/02/23/103,1172230392,67622,0,0.html">got a shot in the arm</a>, with the announcement that it will be adding NeoGeo titles to its repertoire and the addition of several new publishers.<br />
<br />
SNK Playmore, Spike, G-mode, and Pony Canyon are all joining the VC, putting the number of publishers on-board in Japan at 28.  Though no NeoGeo titles have been announced at the moment, the first MSX titles <i>Eggy</i> and <i>Aleste</i> are slated for release this year.<br />
<br />
Several other announcements of upcoming titles for existing VC subplatforms were also made, including <i>Excitebike</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i>&mdash;the latter is available for a whopping 1,200 Wii Points.  No word yet on whether any of these announcements will impact the Virtual Console outside Japan.
