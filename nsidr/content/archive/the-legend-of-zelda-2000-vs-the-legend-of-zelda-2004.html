<p>Boredom got the best of me, so I decided to do a side-by-side comparison of the 2000 Space World technical demo of <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=159">The Legend of Zelda</a></i> and the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo video game of <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911">The Legend of Zelda</a></i>.  Here are the results, which I think are as discernable as Albert Einstein compared to Paris Hilton.  Click on the images for a full-size look.  (Also of note, that you might want to make with the second image, is Nintendo used the same character models for Link and Ganon in SSBMelee and the Zelda tech demo.  Neat.)</p>
