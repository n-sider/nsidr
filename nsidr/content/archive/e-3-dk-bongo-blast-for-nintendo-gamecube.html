<p><ul>
<li>Donkey Kong and his pals have gotten their mitts on some high-powered Barrel
Jets - incredible engines that boost when struck by a pilot. By beating on the DK
Bongos controller, players can make their character swoop up, bank side to side
and launch attacks on rivals. (The game also can be played using a Nintendo
GameCube controller.)
<li>Players challenge the Kremlings or up to three pals on five worlds, each boasting
3-D aerial maps filled with countless obstacles and powerful items. With four
people beating the bongos as they battle for the skies, this game is more party than
race.
