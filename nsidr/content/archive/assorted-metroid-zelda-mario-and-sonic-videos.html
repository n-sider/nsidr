<p>There are things text simply cannot convey.  For those occasions, we have video.  Below is an assorted list of quirky, interesting and sometimes strange Nintendo-related motion pictures.  They're worth checking out so here's to hoping you have a fast connection.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=a8q-elxC6gU">N64 Surprise</a></b> - A young boy and his sister receive a Nintendo 64 for Christmas.  His response?  Just make sure the volume on your computer is at a minimum.<br><br>

<li><b><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=JbVM-l2Oku4">Michael Jackson & Sonic</a></b> - A mini-documentary about a possible connection between popstar Michael Jackson's music and that used in Sega Genesis' Sonic the Hedgehog 3 game.  The truth is out there...<br><br>

<li><b><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Wt_m_iW-Xsw">Mario Super Show Intro</a></b> - This clip highlights the intro to "The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!" that began airing on September 4, 1989.  The cartoon was based on the Super Mario Bros. series and showcased the stars Mario and Luigi, as two Brooklyn plumbers.<br><br>

<li><b><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=GpXYKm2tmu4">Zelda Film Trailer</a></b> - A <a href="http://www.legendofzeldaseries.com">group of fans</a> has gotten together to create a movie based on The Legend of Zelda series.  The trailer is somewhat impressive for being a fan-based project.  The date on the full feature, if one is even coming, is not known.<br><br>

<li><b><a href="http://kodansha.cplaza.ne.jp/e-manga/club/manga/metroid/vol01/">Metroid Comic</a></b> -
Kodansha has published several Metroid flash animations. Although they are entirely in Japanese, a few minutes of examination prove to be enough to decipher the action within the scenes. At the very least, the imagery is worth seeing.  There's also a second part to the video which can be seen <a href="http://kodansha.cplaza.ne.jp/e-manga/club/manga/metroid/vol02/">here</a>.
  </ul>
