Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>While not explicitly reconfirming the lack of high-definition support, Iwata claimed that on standard sets, gamers would not see a discernible difference between Revolution games and those on the PS3 or Xbox 360.</li>
<li>Iwata said Nintendo considers mainstream appeal more important than graphical superiority, and also hopes that buyers of the PS3 or Xbox 360 will also consider Revolution as a second console.</li>
<li>Iwata noted that Western publishers were initially wary of the Revolution's controller until the analog stick attachment was introduced.</li>
<li>Iwata once again confirmed that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> is not headed to Revolution, but is instead still headed for Gamecube.</li>
