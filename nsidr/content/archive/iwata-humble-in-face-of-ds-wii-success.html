Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> has <a href="http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/760/760751p1.html">given an interview</a> to the Japanese Yukan Fuji blog, in which he was asked about Nintendo's success with DS and Wii.<br />
<br />
Iwata realizes that despite early success with Wii, there is still much work to be done.  "Any system will sell well following launch, but there will definitely come a time where it will stop selling. Even the DS hit a rough spell after selling 1.5 million units a month after launch. The flame was really lit a year after launch, after Nintendogs and Brain Age became big hits. With the Wii, we have to make good software just as we did with the DS."<br />
<br />
After offering apologies for continued shortages of Nintendo DS hardware, now extended beyond Japan and into North America, Iwata also explained his attitude toward possibly being the front-runner in the video game industry again.  "So long as we continue the fight against the lack of interest in games from the general consumer, Nintendo will always be the challenger. For example, one challenge is in developing software that keeps people from saying they're no longer interested in swinging the [Wii Remote]."
