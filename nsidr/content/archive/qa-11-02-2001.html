<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
Do you know anywhere I can get the GameCube a game and a memory card please can
you try to find a place cuz I don't have enough for that bug bundle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>-GPextreme</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> A store, perhaps?<br>
<i>Brent:</i> Bug bundle? What the bloody hell is a bug bundle?<br>
<i>Brenden:</i> I say bloody hell all the time, I'm part Irish.<br>
<i>Dean: </i>Bloody hell is British u knob.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> Haha. Dean's right. It is.<br>
<i>Brenden:</i> Believe me, Irish use it too.<br>
<i>Brenden: </i>Scots as well.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> Stupid Irish people ripping off Britain's catchphrases.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> So are we going to answer that bloody question?<br>
<i>Brenden:</i> Which bloody question?<br>
<i>Brent:</i> The first bloody question.<br>
<i>Brenden</i>: Ah. That bloody question.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> Nah, let's not answer it. Move along.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
Hey Guys,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Yeah. The Q&A is finally back! I just wanna know, if
you will be doing a "closer look" report of Rogue Leader Like you did
with SSBM. Thanks. Q&A is back!!!!!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- LC</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> Yes, indeed, the Q&A is back. Better than ever I might add,
out of over 70 questions submitted, we weeded it out to these 15 you see here
today. As for Rogue Leader, we may get one of our editors to put something
together before or after its release.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
Hey guys, I'm planning on buying the system at launch and 1 game (I've got a
tight budget), but I'm not sure which game to get... I'd want a good
single-player game, so Smash Bro's doesn't really interest me, and I've heard
some less-than flattering things about Luigi's Mansion, so at the moment I'm
leaning towards Wave Race... What do you think I should get?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Doctor</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Dean:</i> Personally I'm picking up Rogue Leader, and Luigi's Mansion at
launch, with Wave Race if I can find the money, it really depends on the type of
game you want. If you want the classic Miyamoto-Inspired prodigy, get Luigi's
Mansion, sure it may only play for just over 12 hours, but Its a definite rent,
if anything. If you don't mind the fact that it's Star Wars, and want a great,
awesome looking game, get Rogue Leader. It seems to be the Cube's killer App.
Don't forget about the slew of other 3rd party titles available at launch, I
suggest you rent a few games first, see what is your favorite, and then purchase
that one.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:<br>
</b>What is the Super Nintendo Satellite System?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Joe P.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><br>
<i>Brenden:</i> Nintendo released it in Japan in 1995. Basically, it allowed
players to interact with chat rooms, multiplayer and game downloads.
Unfortunately, it never flew due to it's limitations. <i><u><font size="2">Dean's
Note: and people say Nintendo doesn't know online, sheesh.</font></u></i></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
Will every GameCube game need a memory card, and if so about how many pages will
one game take?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Rowel Magno</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden</i>: Yes, every game will require a memory card.<br>
<i>Dean</i>: I believe its 12-18 pages. Depending on the game.<br>
<i>Brenden</i>: Unless Nintendo has implemented some kind of magical disc
burning technology without informing anyone, there's currently no other way to
save games.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> Which they haven't. So yes, you need a memory card.<br>
<i>Brenden</i>: 3 pages for Luigi, 12 for wave race, 19 for Pikmin, 11 for SSBM</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
Why has it [The QA] been inactive for 6 months?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- duffman</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Dean: </i>Well, after E3 things got pretty hectic around N-Sider.. So we really
never had time to do a QA, after we closed for the redesign, and reopened, it
became sort of a forgotten child. We made some rearrangements to our staff, and
hired Brenden to help us with the QA. The new format (roundtable) that you are
reading today is what we ended up with, but be rest assured it's back. Every
Friday. Booja.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>Brenden:</i> Hey... I do more than that... I get made
fun of too you know.<br>
<i>Dean:</i> go back to your cage, slave boy.<br>
<i>Brenden</i>: Yes sir</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
How noisy are the GameCube's fans? Dreamcast is noisy, ps2 makes a soft noise.
How does the GCN stack up in the background noise dept. As well as the noise
Disk searching makes (I can still hear the bzzz bzzzzzzzz bzz bzz noise the PS
made).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Kyle S.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Dean</i>: While it was hard to hear at e3 (due to the noise around us), and none of us have import units, we can't knowingly answer this question with 100% solid information. I am going on my assumption that the cube is very quiet, it has one fan on the left side, I doubt you will hear anything more than a faint humm, but don't forget, the games will drone out any sound the system makes.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
What are the chances of GameCube getting GTA3?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Tye B.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Brent:</i> Given that Nintendo is viewed as a company that makes games for kids,
we may never see GTA3 on the system. Grand Theft Auto 3 is a super violent game
and I doubt it would ever come to GameCube. I would like to see DMA or Take Two
make a bold move and put the game on GameCube and see how well it sells, but
they haven't announced anything yet and it's something that may never see the
light of day on GameCube.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
Since I couldn't get a preorder for my GC, I will be camping out in front of
Best Buy. How early should I start my camp out? As soon as they close or
midnight? I WANT MY GAMECUBE ON LAUNCH so I will do anything possible. I've been
waiting for GC since May 1999, when images of Dolphin infested my mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>-BW</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Brenden:</i> GO! Run to the store NOW! I bet there's a line-up already!<i><br>
Brent:</i> That's a terrible answer.<br>
<i>Brenden</i>: I know.<br>
<i>Dean: </i>Get some DEPENDS too.. never know when nature will call, and
besides, you dont want to lose your place in line.<br>
<i>Brent</i>: And speaking of depends, it all depends on the store. Some places
like Wal-Mart may sell them at midnight. EB may sell them when they open and may
even open early (they did for the Dreamcast launch.) Whatever the case, you need
to check with all the stores in your area and see what they're going to be doing
for launch.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
Love the site, especially that excellent in-depth review of Smash you did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Anyway, something has been REALLY bugging me lately. What
on God's green Earth is that fancy little teaser commercial which is ALWAYS at
the top of your page? I click on it and a nifty-ass drawing of our favorite
sheiken ninja-chick shows up with the cryptic word BANG and the phrase
"coming soon" written under it. Well it's been "coming soon"
for months now!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">But for the love of all things holy, tell us what it is!!!
A hint? Something?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Thanks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Paul</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Dean</i>: N-Universe is, quite simply, an online trading card... thingy. You
know, how you play Pokmon with your friends, its somewhat like that. I'm not
'allowed' to give out specific details, but be rest assured we have a huge
(upwards of 6 artists) art staff working on this project, you won't be disappointed
when we finally unveil it.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
My dad just bought a 53 inch Sony that is Hi Def ready...I hooked up my N64 and
it looked like crap. My question is how will my GameCube look, will it be hi def
or will it also look crappy?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- S.P.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><font color="#800080"><br>
Fran:</font></i> By their very nature big screen televisions enlarge what is a
640x480 picture. So at 53" those pixels are going to be very big. The good
news with GameCube is that the games feature much sharper texture work. This
lessens the problems you're seeing with your N64. I suggest getting a component
cable hookup, and if your TV is truly HDTV it will support progressive scan.
This will look even more beautiful. However, I really would only want to play my
games on, at its largest, a 36" TV. But, I like clarity over size. I think
four-player Wave Race: Blue Storm in progressive scan mode on a 53" TV will
be awesome.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question</b>:<br>
Is the GameCube controller really that good?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Dean</i>: <b><u>No</u></b> <font size="1">(gotcha!)</font>... I mean, Yes, the
GameCube controller really is that good. It fits your hands perfectly and almost
molds right to them. After you play a game for 5 minutes you'll have mastered
the controls, and you might even forget you're even holding the controller.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
This has been bothering me for quiet some time.. since the GameCube will have a
modem adapter for its system will you be able to connect to some one directly
through a phone line? I got this idea because of two things: one it would be
easier for a company to make a direct connection this way then have to worry
about internet servers; two I also heard that the modem will be available on
release while the broadband adapter won't be available for some time. Thanks in
advance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Spawned by VeeG</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Dean:</i> Its very possible, yet I doubt any games as of right now will support
it, Most games, that will be online, will be for the masses. So a developer will
most likely make you connect to a network (like battle.net), and play. The days
of peer-to-peer gaming are gone.. Its so sad.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b><br>
I've heard that in Super Smash Brothers Melee, you can look up Peach's dress and
Link's toonic. Can you do that? I hope not!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Alexspikachu</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Brent:</i> Cory, answer the Peach dress thing.<br>
<i>Brenden:</i> Yeah... Brent wants to know<br>
<i>Brent:</i> Yeah, I'm anxious to know if I can look up Peach's dress.<br>
<i>Cory:</i> Heh... well in certain circumstances, if you pause and rotate the
camera, you'll most likely be able to look up Peach's dress. I bet you'll be
disappointed, though, since there's no way Nintendo's going to digitize what you
want to see.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> Darn.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b> <br>
I heard that X-Box's CPU is like, 756 MHz and Nintendo's is only 485 MHz. I
know, that it is an IBM CPU but, does Nintendo's compete with X-Box's?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>- Steve</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b></font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/xboxorder.jpg" width="411" height="640"></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>Brent:</i> Yes, it does compete.</font></p>
