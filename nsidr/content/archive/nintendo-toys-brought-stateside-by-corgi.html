Corgi has been a supplier of collectible die-cast models since 1956. Through the years it has acquired other companies that supply trading cards, movie prop replicas, and toys.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, Corgi International Limited announced a license agreement with Nintendo to release various Nintendo products outside of Asia from now into 2010.<br />
<br />
These new Nintendo products will range across many popular franchises such as Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda and includes action figures, playset environments, iconic replicas, plush dolls, vinyl figures, and more. Finally, Nintendo fans outside of Asia can enjoy these Nintendo toys and merchandise without having to import.
