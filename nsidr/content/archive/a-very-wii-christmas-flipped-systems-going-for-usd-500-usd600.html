Even without new entries in the Wii franchise on the horizon, flippers (folks who buy merchandise with the intent to resell it at a higher price online in the face of high demand) are managing to get prices on the upside of US$550 for the system&#8212;more than twice the system's retail value.<br />
<br />
Wii systems have been hard to come by for a full year now, and if these prices are anything to go by, the holiday season is going to be a full-bore repeat of last, with shoppers and flippers alike buying up entire shipments of the console the minute store doors open.<br />
