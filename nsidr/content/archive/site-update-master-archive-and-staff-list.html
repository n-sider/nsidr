<P>Two new elements of the site are now up and running - the <A HREF="archive.php">Master Archives</A> and the <A HREF="about.php">Staff List</A>.</P>

<P>The Master Archives contain a monthly listing of all articles that have appeared on the front page, and are accessable through the "N-Sider Archive" link below the Cover Story cell.</P>

<P>The Staff List is simply a list of all staff members who work for N-Sider, with links to their profiles.  The profiles have yet to be completed, but each staff member's associated articles are listed on their pages.  The Staff List can be accessed through the "About" link in the main site navigation.</P>

<P>More site elements will be added over the coming weeks, so watch the news section for the latest updates.</P>
