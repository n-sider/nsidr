Following up on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2646">yesterday's numbers</a> indicating Wii in the lead with 45% of January console sales, Nintendo of America today also noted a few other sales-related tidbits for that month.<br />
<br />
Sales of the Nintendo DS Lite proved to be a success for Nintendo as well, though not on the scale of Wii; DS Lite units moved nearly 239,000, accompanied by 2.4 million pieces of software.  With all gaming consoles and portables in the mix, Nintendo said they had 46% of the total market between their two offerings.<br />
<br />
On the software charts, four of the top ten best-sellers in January were Nintendo titles.  Nintendo also lends credence to the anecdotal evidence of constant Wii sellouts, noting "The only limit on Nintendo's success is the availability of Wii and DS systems, which continue to sell out as fast as Nintendo can ship them. Shipments are being made continuously to feed the huge demand around the country."
