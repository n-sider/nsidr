The latest Famitsu revealed a sequel to dungeon-crawler extraordinaire, <i>Sekaiju no Meikyu 2: The Royal Grail</i>, or <i>Etrian Odyssey 2</i>.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The labrynth is <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3063-1.jpg">back</a>, as well as a new area to explore&mdash;the flying castle.</li>
  <li>There are <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3063-2.jpg">three new classes</a>: the Doctor Magus, a combat mage with healing properties and offense boosts; the Gunner, who uses elemental bullets; and the Pet, which is simply an animal, such as a bear. Players can also create up to 30 characters for their guild, now.</li>
  <li>The map-making capabilities have been <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3063-3.jpg">enhanced</a> with three different colors and more icons and arrows to use.</li>
  <li>Other improvements include a quicksave function, new rules and types for FOEs, and stats being displayed for characters when purchasing new equipment.</li>
  <li>Komori, the writer of <i>Etrian Odyssey</i> and <i>Princess Crown</i>, is the director for EO2. She says that Atlus decided to make a sequel to the first game because they realized they could improve the balance of the calculations and skills, and brush up the existing formula.</li>
  <li>The character, monster, and sound design are all being handled by the same team as the first game.</li>
  <li>The game is 70% complete and set for a release this coming winter in Japan. A more specific release date will be announced soon.</li>
  </ul><br />
