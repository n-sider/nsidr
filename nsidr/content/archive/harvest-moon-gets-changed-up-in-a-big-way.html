<p>IGN DS, among others, has posted news that <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/663/663341p1.html">a completely original Harvest Moon title</a> is headed for the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>The title is called Rune Factory, and changes up the traditional Harvest Moon formula significantly.  Described by the producer as Harvest Moon with a sword, Rune Factory has players capturing monsters, raising them on their farms, and setting out on adventures with them.</p>

<p>Jeux-France has <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news13062_rune-factory-annonce.html">screenshots of the new title</a>.  Rune Factory is being developed by the Neverland Company and is slated for a 2006 release in Japan.</p>
