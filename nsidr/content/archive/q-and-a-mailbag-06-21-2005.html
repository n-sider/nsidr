<p><b>Edition: 06-21-2005</b>

<p>This is kind of a special edition of the mailbag. Im only including three letters, due to the length of one of them. All three have to do with <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i>, which is nice. There isnt much else to say, so be sure to send your questions, criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>.  

<p>Travis, James, and I fill this edition with Zelda magic. Topics of interest are Nintendos overall stance on simple games, voice acting in Zelda, transparent storylines, and whatever else Matt Griffis talks about in his 2,400 word letter.

<h3>Voice Acting in Zelda</h3>
<p>N-Sider,

<p>With all this talk about how Zelda could be made stronger than it already is, the story and storytelling seems to be the next direction after graphics for the Zelda franchise. I think what the storytelling needs to nudge it over the edge is some quality, well written and acted voice acting.

<p>People talk about how Wind Waker's story was much more complicated, deep, and well written. I for one, however, found the lack of voices to be somewhat... distracting. Especially glaring is the final sequence with Ganondorf, Zelda, Link, and the King of Red Lions on the top of the tower. There was fantastic story telling, wonderful atmospheric effects and beautiful animation. However, as far as vocal audio went, there were merely grunts from Ganondorf (with some wonderful villain dialogue) gibberish from the King, and a giggle from Zelda. Such opportunities exist for great voice acting. Link doesn't even have to talk, others talk to him.

<p>I think it's one avenue that Nintendo should definitely be looking down, and I wanted to hear your opinions on the matter.

<p>Thanks for reading,

<p><i>- Andrew Salter</i>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Well, I kind of agree with you. While I definitely dont think that Nintendo HAS to have voice acting in Legend of Zelda games, it would be nice. I dont believe Link needs to talk, but as you pointed out, there are instances where the lack of voices can ruin the drama of the moment a bit. It puts all of the emotional baggage squarely on the shoulders of the composer. Luckily, as a series, Zelda has always featured the very best in music. Nevertheless, I too noticed the lack of voice acting in instances like that (when you are first talking to the Deku Tree in <i>Wind Waker</i> its very apparent). I sincerely doubt that <i>Twilight Princess</i> will have any form of advanced voice acting, but I hope Nintendo invests in it for future games. 

<p><b>Travis: </b>I admit that I wouldnt be adverse to voice acting in a Zelda title, but it is not something I sincerely wish Nintendo would get around to.  I happen to love all the grunts Zelda characters make.  I find it gives us an idea of what they would sound like while still allowing the use of a little thing I like to call imagination.  Its just part of the charm with me.  Having said that, I admit that the direction for dialogue heavy scenes in <i>TWW</i> didnt seem to take the lack of voice acting into account.  I dont know what it is, but when I watch a scene in <i>OoT</i> or <i>MM</i>, which also lacks voice acting, it seems fine.  When I watch certain scenes in <i>TWW</i> it feels like the game is muted.  As a result, I can certainly understand why someone would want Nintendo to explore the voice acting route.  Im just not one of those people.

<h3>Transparent Storylines</h3>
<p>I don't know if this is the address to write q & a to or not, but it looked like it on the website?

<p>anyways, all i wanted to say was that I think people don't notice the storyline in a zelda game because they are the one's living/experiencing it.  There's some kind of storyline or plot to your actual, real life, but most people don't notice it because it is transparent to them.  The same kind of thing goes for zelda games.  I think Majora's mask is a perfect example of a game with an INCREDIBLY complex story with plenty of established characters.  just because it isn't spelled out for you in text and motion videos doesn't mean it isn't there.  I'd say it's there is short story about how each character is living out what they think/don't think are the last three days of their life, not to mention link's own story.  Links ability to travel back to the first day is a really clever way to let the gamer discover the story of every character he interacts with.  And that doesn't even take into account the different races (zoras, humanoids, gorons...) of characters responding in different ways collectivly to the impending doom of the moon.  Then there's the shifts in urgency from the first day to the last, and the overall helpless feel the player gets after a while when you realize that no matter what you do, you can really only help/save one group of people or person at a time (until you beat it of course). before i get all carried away though, that's mostly all i wanted to say.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>I agree. If only Matt Griffis (whose letter is below) understood where you are coming from

<h3>Longest-Letter-EVAR!11 </h3>
<p>I'd just like to follow up on my lengthy Zelda letter that was posted in the latest mailbag, 'cause I think you misunderstood some of what I was trying to say.  First, regarding the story--I guess it's a relative thing.  You say that if I don't consider OoT, MM and TWW (augh, too many acronyms!) to have an epic story then I must be a little crazy, and you're right that, compared to let's-drop-you-right-into-the-game-without-even-an-introduction Zelda I, those games are the War and Peace of the interactive story scene.  But let's compare.  Against an RPG like Tales of Symphonia, the Final Fantasies or Xenosaga, The Legend of Zelda has nothing.  Before you slam me for bringing in a story-focused genre which has at LEAST twice the number of hours to deliver the tale in, consider also Beyond Good and Evil, which has the best friggin' story and characters I have EVER seen in a videogame, and busts it all out in half the time that it takes to finish Wind Waker.  BG&E is an epic story and no Zelda compares.  I don't mean to dismiss the Zelda series as having no story at all, and I didn't mean to imply that the tale was lame, either.  

<p>But to me, a compelling and epic story requires two things: strong characters with Development (capitalized because it's so important), and a complex and involved narrative arc which dangles mystery and plot twists in one's face until the very end when everything is resolved.  Wind Waker, for all its greatness, has little of either.  The fleshing out of Ganondorf's personality (I empathized--a little--with the bugger by the end, and that was a nice touch) notwithstanding, the Zelda series has never featured very many characters with actual personalities, and those that have them don't really change in any significant way.  I still LIKE the characters, but I never cared for Zelda or even Link half as much as I did for Jade and Pey'j by the end of Beyond Good and Evil.  The characters in the Zelda games, because of the primarily-solo-wandering nature of the game, don't really get much of a chance to come alive in any way and imprint themselves upon my consciousness.  I therefore have little emotional involvement with the various NPCs and that, in my opinion, hurts the story--after all, what is a play without its actors?  

<p>As for the scenario arc, or whatever you want to call it, while it's true that there is a great deal in between the dungeon-crashing and boss-bashing, how is it not just embellishment atop the latter?  We know, from the moment we boot up a Zelda game, what's going to happen.  We may not know that we will climb a fortress, knocking out searchlights and whacking a huge bird with a ridiculously-large hammer (heh heh heh), or just what form the next dungeon will take, or what secrets lie in that cave in the distance, but we still DO know that eventually we're going to proceed to that next dungeon, collect something cool to power up with, and then do it again and again until we can throw down with the G-Man (or Majora's Mask, but you get the idea), and there really isn't anything beyond that. RPGs may also break down into something similar, but they manage to disguise it in a way that the Zelda series does not.  In Tales, you play 20+ hours only to discover that the goal you've been striving for all this time is not the end, and that there's a whole new quest to embark on--and then that quest goes places you could never have imagined.  Xenosaga is a space opera, for crying out loud, which makes you feel like something HUGE is going on and you're not going to know what it is till you're through it.  BG&E, again negating the length requirement, does that sort of thing too.  I play (and love, mind you) the Zelda series because it has excellent and compelling gameplay.  I do not play it because of the story.  Am I at all compelled by it?  Yes--each of the games still has its moments, no argument.  Do I feel like I'm part of something big and breathtaking while playing, and remember the story with emotion afterwards?  No, and it is for this reason that I don't consider the Zelda stories to be epic.  Link may save the world of Termina from fiery destruction by the creepiest evil moon/mask combo in the entire universe (probably the only one, too), and that, I suppose, is epic in magnitude, but it nevertheless doesn't come off as an epic, far-reaching, captivating tale. 

<p>GREAT game, but not an epic tale to my mind.

<p>Now (after that huge monologue), did Beyond Good and Evil have to sacrifice exploration and imagination-provocation (heh) in order to deliver such a kicking story?  I'm not so sure.  It's hard to become Jade like you can impose yourself on Link (and kinda pointless), and the world may not be quite as open and free-roaming, but there's still plenty of exploration to be done and magic to unearth.  I see no reason why a Zelda game couldn't present a story on this scale and this involving, while still preserving the Zelda spirit.  Make Link interact with people more!  Make lots of characters like Sheik who keep on popping up but give them more active roles, deeper personalities, and true development so, by the end, you really worry at the possibility of one of them kicking the bucket (which is a danger).  Make the story more than just an extension of Evil Dude rears his ugly head so let's level up and beat him down; give true plot twists that aren't just "gasp!  You're really _____!"  You're right--WW does have a deeper, more focused story than Ocarina and MM.  Let's see that sort of jump again, but add in the characters and character development and mysteries beyond the "Oooh, I wonder what's on THAT island" sort.  Surely this is doable, and I can't believe it would make anyone UNhappy.  And hey!  I've been pointing out how the length of an RPG isn't necessary because a game like BG&E can pull of a masterpiece like none other in 10 or 15 hours, but with the rumored promise of a 70+ hour playtime ( http://cube.ign.com/articles/606/606585p1.html ) for the new Zelda, it'll have just as much time as an RPG anyway!

<p>At any rate, we may just have different definitions of "epic," but regardless I hope you now understand what I'm talking about.  Oh, and speaking of different definitions, as for gameplay--I'm not at all dismissing the power of gameplay tweaks.  But they are, as you said yourself, tweaks.  Look at how much difference the tweaking of combat made in WW--think how much difference a fundamental change to the formula could bring.  That said, I'm not positive I ever actually said that I WANTED massive changes, and I'm still not sure whether I do or not.  If anything, such would be related the story changes described above.  Altering the game to greatly increase the role of NPCs would go a long way towards enriching the story AND making the game a different beast, and I think the Zelda series could use such a shakeup, if for no other reason than for us to possibly discover that we PREFER same ol' same ol'.

<p>And Jeff, I meant that Nintendo has little reason, in terms of consumer demand, to RADICALLY change anything between WW and the new Zelda besides graphics.  I've heard the opinion voiced that the new Zelda's incredible realism is a way of assuaging the tempers of all those who didn't like "Celda," and whether or not one accepts that theory, the outcry WAS over the graphic change.  What does it prove?  All those gamers could see was graphics they didn't like, and now they're getting the graphics they wanted. 
  
<p>If everything else was crud, they'd still be unhappy (or at least one would like to think so), but as long as everything else remains AS good--but not-necessarily changed in any large way--I firmly believe there will be a lot of people who will be satisfied.  As for story, what it comes down to is this: there are, I guess, two types.  There is the sort of story which you really have to wrap your mind around, one that captivates you, mystifies you, and never lets go through all the cyclonic developments and earthquakes of plot twist until the very end, and it is this kind I consider "epic."  Then there is the simple story, which can be just as masterfully delivered and interesting but requires considerably less emotional involvement and (this sounds negative, but isn't) thought, the sort you can read and enjoy and then more or less forget about until the next time you pick up the book. 
 
<p>Legends can fall into this category, and, unsurprisingly, it is this sort which I consider the Zelda series to be.  There is nothing wrong with either sort.  I'd just like to see a Zelda game with an epic story, that's all. It doesn't have to make my brain hurt like Xenosaga (or Xenogears...), but I would like more than what we've gotten.

<p>And finally, because this topic will never be let go: Wind Waker's looks...I NEVER denied the beauty of the game.  I am, in fact, one of the few whom I know who was not at all upset by the graphical change when it was first announced.  It IS a wonderful-looking game.  But you cannot deny that there were, and perhaps still are, plenty of gamers who felt differently.  That's all I was saying.  I don't agree with them, but they do exist.

<p>As for the latest N-Banter, I think you came down far too hard on Matt (and not because he has the same name as I).  Matt is doing exactly what a fanboy does NOT, which is to look at the cold, hard facts.  I don't think he wishes Nintendo to produce the N-station 3 at all, and he's perfectly willing to give simple stuff a chance.  His point is simply that the gamers who own PS2s and X-Boxes (the majority, in other words), are still happily buying the same games with the same, tired game designs, and have given no indication that they intend to do otherwise in the future.This is reality. To therefore ignore this entire consumer base, convinced that they don't really want what they're buying when they clearly do, is a huge mistake.  To design a console which does not support the same ol' stuff is to alienate all of those gamers and the companies who make games, and that would be financial suicide.  But, as you pointed out, Nintendo has no intention of doing that.  I think Matt is just worried that they'll focus TOO much on producing the simple stuff and not support the old-school crowd enough, which could doom their chances of dominance and indeed continued market presence.  As a Nintendo die-hard, he doesn't want that.  You're right that, prior to the NES, gamers didn't know they wanted it.  How could they?  But there have been a LOT of other new ideas that gamers STILL didn't want after the stuff came out.  What happens to Nintendo if this is the case with Revolution, especially when they've already got games and systems they're happy with?  Disaster, that's what.  You suggest Matt doesn't understand Nintendo's philosophy, that he's too fan-boyish and uneducated.  But take a look at this paragraph which I jacked outta the offending IGNCube mailbag:

<p><i>"According to Nintendo, players are declining, or will decline in the future. However, this only seems to be true of Nintendo players. I look at sales of PlayStation 2 and Xbox games and they are on the rise. Sales of Halo 2 did not decline compared to the original. Sales of San Andreas did not see a dramatic reduction compared to its predecessor. The market is healthy. There are millions of gamers out there buying these titles. Why ignore that? For a company that always reverts to the bottom line, which is profitability, going against the grain of the industry and its consumer base doesn't seem the most logical move."</i>

<p>Now, explain to me how this is uneducated in any way?  Seems perfectly logical to me.  He doesn't want Nintendo to just follow in Microsoft and Sony's footsteps, but he wants it to realize that there are a LOT of already-established gamers who are, and maybe they should receive just as much attention as the theoretical five-million more Revolution might attract.  This is well-reasoned and good business.  Nintendo cannot just blindly assume that gamers will follow its whims if it wishes to survive--its lackluster position in the current market is evidence enough of that.  I am a hardcore gamer, and though I love Nintendo most I am willing to play other consoles (originally only 'cause Sony snagged Square, but what can you do).  I still want what the current crop of games delivers.  I can't wait to play through Ratchet & Clank: UYA and Jak III (once they go to Greatest Hits and my cheapo budget can afford them).  I'm excited about what the Revolution offers, but I'm more interested in deep gaming experiences than simplistic ones (RPGs are my favorite genre, after all), and I'll keep wanting them for a long time yet, whether Nintendo thinks so or not.  Why should I be neglected?  Nintendo says it will continue to fully support those of us who want this big-budget, big-deal stuff, but it's said things like that before (continuing strong GBA support, post-DS, anyone?), and what I'm worried about, and what Matt's worried about, is that it will not deliver, and will thus abandon the current crop of gamers in quest of a dream that might or might not come to fruition.  Innovation does not have to exclude everything else.  You suggest Matt is too skeptical and has no faith, but if you read all of his mailbags you'd know that he has plenty of faith...it just isn't blind.

<p>And finally, so that there will be SOMETHING that I can be reasonably sure we'll agree on...BEYOND GOOD & EVIL ROCKS THE FREAKIN' HOUSE DOWN!!!!!!  It is the ultimate crime against humanity that the gaming world forsook that gem, and thus hurt me personally by denying me any possibility of a sequel, an especially nasty truth after the game's ending...

<p>Do I have the Longest-Letter-EVAR!11 Award?  ;)

<p>Peace

<p><b>Jeff: </b>(Before I begin, this is an older letter that Ive been avoiding answering due to how freaking long it is. <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/columnview.php?columnid=121>Here</a> is a link to the mailbag where his first letter can be found and <a href= https://www.nsidr.com/columnview.php?columnid=119>here</a> is a link to the edition of N-Banter we discuss.) Before I begin, Im pretty much letting James respond to the Revolution portion of the letter.  Travis is tackling NPCs. As for myself, Im in a state of bewilderment.

<p>This letter is probably one of the major reasons why Mailbag updates have been so scarce lately. When I received your 2,400 word rebuttal, I knew exactly what I wanted to say. I knew exactly what counter arguments I was going to make and was thoroughly prepared to make them in my typical detailed and elongated fashion. But then I hesitated. I no longer had any desire to say what I had planned because I realized one thing: it isnt going to change your mind. The Legend of Zelda games have moved me in ways that I cannot describe and I feel more connected to their stories than any other game series. Nothing can change that. No amount of words could ever make me believe that <i>Xenosaga</i> or even <i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> (which I loved) featured better, deeper, and more memorable stories than <i>Wind Waker</i> or <i>Ocarina of Time</i>. This is not the same for you. You dont share my connection to those games, and no amount of arguing will change that. 

<p>Perhaps <i>Twilight Princess</i> or future Zelda games will merge our opinions and provide an experience we both feel to be near flawless. Perhaps not. In either case, were both happy. You have the games that connect to you on that deep level and I have mine. After 2,400 words, Im no closer to understanding your point of view as you are my own. So with that I will let it rest. 

<p>However, I do have a little something to say about some of your Revolution comments. Before James gets to do his thing and spew out exactly what I believe, in a cleaner and more precise way than I could ever state it, I do have one quote that Id like to postif not only to ensure that everyone has read it. When <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=885>Wired News</a> asked <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170>Shigeru Miyamoto</a> what Nintendo plans to do to get the Japanese video game industry out of the decline it has been in for several years, he responded with the following: 

<blockquote><font size=2>I don't really think it's a Japanese problem. I think it's an industry wide and worldwide issue. In fact, I'm surprised how well the U.S. has held up; I think the U.S. is more the exception rather than the rule. What's happening with video games is the same thing that happens with anything new and interesting. At the beginning, everybody wants to see what it is. They gather around and check it out. But gradually, people start to lose interest. The people who don't lose interest become more and more involved. And the medium starts to be influenced by only those people. It becomes something exclusive to the people who've stuck with it for a long time. And when the people who were interested in it at first look back at it, it's no longer the thing that interested them. 
<p>So obviously, it's very important for us to create brand new things that bring back those people. But it's just as important to create the kind of games that current gamers know they like. <br><b> Shigeru Miyamoto</b></font></blockquote>


<p><b>Travis: </b>I havent read any N-Query updates in a while and am no longer very up to date on the news regarding Matt over at IGN so Im going to sit that subject out.  In regards to Zelda, I will say that I still think youre crazy.  I fully see your point this time and admit I didnt quite understand before . . . I just dont agree.  When you say that Zelda NPCs arent very involving and lack character development I disagree with my mind, body, and soul.  I find Zelda NPCs to be the most involved of any Adventure/RPG title.  In <i>Final Fantasy</i> or other traditional RPGs you get what I like to call Robot NPCs because they have no depth at all.  I find character development only from those that can also be in your party and a couple other characters (the villain, mainly).  Meanwhile, in Zelda we see massive character development, but in the form of subtlety.  Im not going to say youre wrong, but you certainly see things differently.  Its true that, currently, no one is playing through a Zelda title in fear that they are about to be betrayed or that another character is going to die.  I dont think those sorts of elements are the only way to have character development, however.  You may be happy with <i>Twilight Princess</i>, though, as it seems to have more interactive NPCs and a storyline where anything goes based on the E3 demo.  Look for more details in the N-Depth article that I co-authored with Chris Carson on <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=466><i>Twilight Princess</i> at E3</a>.

<p><i>Beyond Good & Evil</i> is good though.  But from my point of view most Zelda games have a deeper storyline.  This brings me to a point I didnt feel like fitting into my large first paragraph:  Link.  Link isnt exactly supposed to be a character with lots of development.  Hes <i>you</i>.  Hes every gamer.  Jade, on the other hand, is her own character and by playing <i>BG&E</i> we experience her adventure.  This is not a knock against <i>BG&E</i> just as you never actually knocked the Zelda games.  I simply suppose that part of the reason I find Zelda titles to be a deeper experience than the games you insist upon is because I <i>am</i> Link.  I am on the adventure; Im a part of the world.  The best way to create a deep story is by drawing the gamer into it.  It could be argued that this is why I do care about the NPCs in Zelda games.  I feel like <i>Im</i> the one interacting with them and I care about the people I interact with.

<p><b>James: </b>I think the key problem here is that we are on slightly different tangents.  In regard to Matt, I do not mean to pick on him specifically - I just think that much of what he says is kind of indicative of certain types of Nintendo fans.  By that I mean, people who are fans but who aren't quite looking at the whole picture.  One of the examples that I mentioned in N-Banter was the N-Query articles and how they often seem to have an argumentative tone, with some questions phrased in ways that appear to misunderstand Nintendo.  I already mentioned the N-Query article that suggested Nintendo believes the current industry is "broken."  Obviously that question implied that Nintendo had actually indicated this belief, though it clearly hasn't.  It's almost like putting words in Nintendo's mouth - it's a misunderstanding of the company's philosophy.  But there's a lot more to it than that.  Let me take a moment to answer your points a bit more specifically.

<p>In a sense, what you are saying is right.  Traditional games and traditional game consoles are still selling.  That much is definitely true.  But Nintendo is not trying to suggest otherwise; Iwata has gone to great lengths to explain that Nintendo will continue to cater to that core audience.  However, Nintendo has another intention: to avoid a future industry collapse.  I feel that Nintendo's intention in this regard is misinterpreted by some as the company simply giving up, because it somehow can't compete with Microsoft and Sony on their own turf.

<p>Sure, Nintendo can continue to chase existing gamers; it can continue to pursue the very same audience and it can try to wrestle some of that space away from its competition (as I'm sure it will do to some degree).  However, the industry is experiencing a problem that continues to snowball as time goes by.  The problem?  Sharply increasing development costs, coupled with lower profitability.  It's a dangerous cycle that threatens every game company, including Sony and Microsoft.  Microsoft has already acknowledged this problem, by introducing the XNA initiative for their next generation Xbox.  And part of Nintendo's response is to make development for Revolution as cheap and easy as possible.

<p>However, that's only part of the solution.  Nintendo also seeks to expand the overall market - it seeks to create new avenues for revenue.  I would make the analogy of a car traveling down a road with a dead end.  The car keeps picking up speed; with every mile that goes by, the car gets closer and closer to hitting that brick wall.  How do you avoid hitting the brick wall?  You take the off-ramp and head for a different road.  I think it is clear that this concept plays a large role in Nintendo's philosophy with both DS and Revolution.  Nintendo <i>isn't</i> trying to say that nobody cares about existing games.  Nintendo <i>isn't</i> saying that nobody cares about Halo or Gran Turismo; it's simply saying that in addition to these games, it is possible to create interactive entertainment that attracts people who perhaps haven't played games before - or even those who stopped playing games some time ago.

<p>In reference to the quote you posted, I think it is basically true, except that it makes the suggestion that Nintendo is ignoring the core gaming market when it isn't.  However, that single quote also doesn't acknowledge the industry's current path, which has several inevitable negative consequences.  In coming generations, if costs continue to rise (and they will), we are talking about less game developers surviving, longer development times, much larger development costs and potentially significantly higher prices for games at the retail level.  Such a situation isn't sustainable and if that trend continues, something has got to give.

<p>So yes, the market is currently healthy.  Yes, there's plenty of room for companies such as Nintendo to be successful with core gamers.  But that acknowledgement is limited and simplistic; it ignores the future and forgets the lessons learned from previous generations.

<p>You suggest that Nintendo has a lackluster position in the current market, <i>despite</i> the fact that it is the most profitable of the big three hardware makers and <i>despite</i> the fact that Game Boy Advance SP and Nintendo DS continue to sell very strongly.  It's the same logic that says "biggest number of units sold = winner".  How is someone the winner if they aren't making any money?  The sheer amount of units sold is almost irrelevant if one ignores the actual amount of money being made.

<p>You also said that you're interested in deep gaming experiences rather than simplistic ones - you therefore assume that Revolution will only entertain simplistic game concepts.  That is <i>exactly</i> the kind of misunderstanding I'm referring to.  When Mr. Iwata talks about simplicity, he isn't talking about the depth of a game's puzzles or story.  He is talking about how easily accessible a game is - he's talking about how one interacts with the game.  As you know, there are plenty of games that are very "pick up and play", but that are also very deep in terms of gameplay and strategy.  This misunderstanding / misinterpretation is exactly the type of thing that I was referencing in N-Banter.

<p>So to finish my all-too-long response, it's not that I think Matt is too skeptical and has no faith.  It's simply that I think he sometimes misinterprets Nintendo's philosophy and position.  My support of Nintendo doesn't come from any kind of blind faith, it's just that I understand what Nintendo is trying to do.  Does that mean I think Revolution isn't a risk?  Does it mean that I think Nintendo will automatically achieve success with its current approach?  Of course not.  For all I know, this entire strategy may completely bomb; Nintendo may not have the answers to several of the looming problems that the industry faces as a whole.  But whether it has the answers or not, I maintain that its current approach is still misunderstood by a lot of people out there.  I tend to chalk it up to what I call "the 16-bit mentality"; that is, a mentality that doesn't acknowledge many of the changes in the industry over the last few years.  It's a viewpoint that doesn't recognize the depth and breadth of the industry, the various problems with current development trends and the idea that games remaining forever identical isn't necessarily a good thing (for gamers or the industry itself).
