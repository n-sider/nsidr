<p>Chris Kohler from <a href="http://blog.wired.com/games/">Wired Magazine</a> reports that Nintendo is showcasing Super Smash Bros. Brawl. "They showed us an ass-kicking video featuring new characters like [Konami's] Solid Snake and [Nintendo's] Kid Icarus, and Wario," he said.  "They're having Miyamoto and Sakurai, the designer, talk about it."

<p>Other characters are said to include Zero-Suit Samus from Metroid and Meta Knight from Kirby.  The game will also feature online play, although it is unknown if it will be four players.  Wario will have a fart move.  Also, players will likely be able to use the GameCube controller to play.</p>

<p>Super Smash Bros. Brawl won't be available at Wii's launch.</p>

<p>When asked about the possibility of Sonic the Hedgehod appearing in the game as well, Shigeru Miyamoto said: "There are probably possibilities for other third parties as well, and it maybe that even know there are corporate discussions going on about including some of these other characters."</p>
