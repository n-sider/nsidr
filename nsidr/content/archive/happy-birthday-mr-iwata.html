<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/employees/satoruiwata-09.jpg" border="0" align="right">Nintendo Co., Ltd. president, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a>, turns 46 today.  N-Sider wishes the man -- who has provided Nintendo with a renewed and passionate vision -- a very healthy and happy birthday.<br><br>
Through the years, Iwata's motivation and charisma has been relentless.  He began his career as an unknown programmer at an unknown company named <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/hal-laboratory-company-profile">HAL Laboratory</a> and rose through the ranks of HAL to attain the position of president.  He turned HAL around, saving the company from financial peril, and soon acquired a position within Nintendo as the head of its Corporate Planning Division.  It wasn't long before he was named and succeeded <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=382">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> as the fourth president in Nintendo's history.  More of Iwata's interesting past can be found <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/profileview.php?profileid=1">here</a>.<br><br>
<i>"On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer."</i> - <font size="2">Iwata during his <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/595/595089p1.html">Heart of a Gamer</a> speech</font><br><br>
N-Sider hopes to see Iwata continue to grow and prosper as Nintendo's leader in the exciting years ahead.  Don't worry Iwata, 46 is still young!
