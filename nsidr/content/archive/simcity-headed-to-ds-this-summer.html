Electronic Arts announced today that it plans to bring <i>SimCity DS</i>, recently released in Japan, to the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
SimCity DS, a version of <i>SimCity 3000</i>, puts players in charge of planning, building, and running a city.  The DS version of the game adds things like signing proclamations with the stylus and blowing into the microphone to put out fires.  Wireless data exchange will let players of the game communicate, and a "wide array of recognizable international landmarks" will also feature.<br />
<br />
SimCity DS is slated to drop to retail sometime this summer.
