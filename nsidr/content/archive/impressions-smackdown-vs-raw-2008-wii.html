<i>WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2008</i>, which we previewed at Barker Hangar, dispenses with the days of button mashing and replaces it with   the Wii Remote equivalent&mdash;swinging your arms wildly.<br />
<br />
Graphically, the title looks alright but doesn't sport a high level of detail. Tons of graphical glitches were present in the E3 demo (my wrestler straddled an invisible rope), and it left a lot to be desired.<br />
<br />
The controls are fairly simple: Use the analog stick on the Nunchuk to move, Z button to pin, and the rest is done by waving the Wii Remote around and pressing either A, B, or both. Any moves you make feel like they're happening at random.  Hopefully the controls will see some attention before release, as SmackDown! vs Raw is apparently a "game made from the ground up for the Wii"&mdash;but it just felt to me like a new-generation button mashfest.
