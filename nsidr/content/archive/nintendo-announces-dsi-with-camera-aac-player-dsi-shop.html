While those of us with day jobs were sleeping, Nintendo was holding a conference over on their home turf where they unveiled the DSi, the latest in the Nintendo DS line.<br />
<br />
The DSi will be available in Japan in both white and black colors November 1 for &#65509;18,900, which works out to $180 at current exchange rates&#8212;but it's only about 13% more expensive than the DS Lite sells for in Japan, so we could see DSi for less here.  Maybe.<br />

Features of the new hardware include:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Very slightly thinner, a little longer, and a whopping 4 grams&#8212;less than 2%&#8212;lighter than DS Lite</li>
  <li>Screen size increased by Â¼", battery life reduced 25-50% over DS Lite</li>
  <li>Additional indicator light for wireless communication</li>
  <li>Power button on the inside of the unit</li>
  <li>An SD slot on the side where the DS Lite's power button is</li>
  <li>0.3 megapixel camera (likely VGA or 640Ã—480 resolution)</li>
  <li>A new interface including new software such an AAC (not MP3) music player and photo-editing software for the camera</li>
  <li>A new DSi Shop featuring downloadable titles purchasable for 0-800 Nintendo Points, Wii Points' new moniker</li>
  <li>DSi Shop will have a new web browser available</li>
  <li>Slot-2 is gone&#8212;no more GBA games or Option Paks&#8212;but can play both DS software and new DSi software</li>
  </ul><br />
Regional Nintendo offices in Europe and the U.S. have conferences of their own that will be taking place very soon; hopefully, we'll have some more details then about what we can expect regarding DSi as customers outside the Land of the Rising Sun.
