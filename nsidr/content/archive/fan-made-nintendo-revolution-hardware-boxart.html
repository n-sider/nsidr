<p>Crafty photoshop-wielding fans have taken to the task of envisioning the boxart for the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Nintendo Revolution</a> hardware.  I'm not sure where they're going with the handle.  Stay away.  The images come via <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/nintendo_rev/66475.html">LiveJournal.com</a>.  Overall, they've managed to take the simplicity of the console design and apply it to the boxart well enough.  Hats off, although I'm still confident we'll be more impressed with what Nintendo's designers ultimately come up with.</p>
