<p>Datel has announced the development of Advance Game Port for the Game Boy Advance.  The Advance Game Port is an all-in-one device that allows you to play Game Boy Advance and SP games on your TV and also create and use cheat codes.  The Advance Game Port is similar to the Game Boy Player in that it allows you to play your Game Boy games on television using your GameCube controller.</p>
