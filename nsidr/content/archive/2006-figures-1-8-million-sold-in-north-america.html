In a video report on CNBC, market analysts NPD have said Nintendo has <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=158897930&play=1">sold 1.8 million Wii consoles</a> between the console's launch this past November 19.  Anecdotal reports, as well as this reporter's personal experience, suggest that even to this day, Wii shipments to retail sell out within hours of store openings.<br />

NPD also mentioned Wii's competition: during the November and December period, Microsoft's Xbox 360 moved 2 million units, edging out Wii slightly (though with an 18-day advantage, as the console launched last year.)  Sony's brand-new PlayStation 3 sold 750,000 units, according to the firm's estimation.
