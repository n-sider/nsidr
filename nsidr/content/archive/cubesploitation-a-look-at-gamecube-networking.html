  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Homebrewing has been around for a 
    while on different consoles. The PSX, Dreamcast, PS2, and Xbox all have development 
    communities (which won't be linked here) that provide tools and guides on using 
    your console for reasons other than gaming. An interesting fact about GameCube 
    development however, is that no hardware modification is needed at all - which 
    means no modification chips, and your warranty isn't voided either. Below are 
    basic definitions of the programs mentioned in the article, for easy reference:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em><strong>Program A</strong></em> 
    - The initial program that allowed the interception of the network signal - 
    it tricked the GameCube into thinking a user's PC was actually a SEGA server.<em><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Program B</strong> - </em>A simple disc browser used to see directories 
    and filenames off of a swapped GameCube disc<em>, </em>helpful to create custom 
    Action Replay codes. <em><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Program C</strong> - </em>Essentially a glorified Dex-Drive, this program 
    allows users to upload and download memory card files to and from their PC.<em><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Program D</strong> - </em>Allows a user to swap their disc from PSO 
    to another game, and stream all the data from the GameCube drive to an image 
    file on the user's PC hard disk.<em><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Program E</strong> - </em>Allows a user to load homebrewed applications. 
    A modified version of this program was made to load illegal GameCube game images.<em><br>
    <br>
    <strong>Program F</strong> - </em> A central GUI (<strong>G</strong>raphical 
    <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>I</strong>nterface) which provides an easy-to-use 
    approach at copying and loading games / homebrew.</font></p><br>
  <i>WAN</i> - Wide Area Network, simply a direct connection to the internet with no other workgroup PCs involved.<br><br>
  <i>LAN</i> - Connecting through a PC workstation, usually typical Cable connections use a LAN function - shared connection.<br>

  <p>The following are excerpts from a Q&A from Nintendo.com's "Legal Information".</p>
  
  <p><b>Can I Download a Nintendo ROM from the Internet if I Already Own the Authentic Game?</b></p> 
  
  <p>There is a good deal of misinformation on the Internet regarding the backup/archival copy exception. It is not a "second copy" rule and is often mistakenly cited for the proposition that if you have one lawful copy of a copyrighted work, you are entitled to have a second copy of the copyrighted work even if that second copy is an infringing copy. The backup/archival copy exception is a very narrow limitation relating to a copy being made by the rightful owner of an authentic game to ensure he or she has one in the event of damage or destruction of the authentic. Therefore, whether you have an authentic game or not, or whether you have possession of a Nintendo ROM for a limited amount of time, i.e. 24 hours, it is illegal to download and play a Nintendo ROM from the Internet.</p>
  
  <p><b>How Does Nintendo Feel About the Emergence of Video Game Emulators?</b></p>
  
  <p>The introduction of emulators created to play illegally copied Nintendo software represents the greatest threat to date to the intellectual property rights of video game developers. As is the case with any business or industry, when its products become available for free, the revenue stream supporting that industry is threatened. Such emulators have the potential to significantly damage a worldwide entertainment software industry which generates over $15 billion annually, and tens of thousands of jobs.</p>
  
  <p><b>How Come Nintendo Does Not Take Steps Towards Legitimizing Nintendo Emulators?</b></p>
  
  <p>Emulators developed to play illegally copied Nintendo software promote piracy. That's like asking why doesn't Nintendo legitimize piracy. It doesn't make any business sense. It's that simple and not open to debate.</p>

A Look at<br> GameCube Networking</font></strong></font><br>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

<p>Have you ever sat down and looked at your GameCubes disc tray and wondered 
  When will it play burned games?  Im sure many of 
  you have and that same group of you has dismissed that question with the answer: 
  Never. And that, my friends, is true for the most part. In the 
  last year, an initiative has started; just as it did for the PlayStation and 
  Xbox. And that initiative, is known as Homebrew GameCube development.</p>
<p>Before I venture any further into this article, Ill give you a little 
  rundown on what homebrew means:</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Homebrew  n.</em></strong><em><br>
  An alcoholic beverage that is made at home.</em></p>
<p>Alright, so take that definition and replace the alcoholic beverage with GameCube 
  programs and in a nutshell youve got homebrew coding. In the following 
  sections I will provide a brief but informative overview of how piracy works 
  on the GameCube, why its possible and a quazi-chronological history of 
  its development. <br>
</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">The GameCube</font></strong><br>
  Its no secret that the GameCube is the most secure console out there 
  when it comes to piracy. The discs are rumoured to be read in a reverse manner 
  (outside to in, instead of inside to out), the discs are specially sized, and 
  finally the disc tray itself is unable to hold discs larger than a GoD 
  (GameCube Optical Disc). Combine these elements with built in barcode detection, 
  and dummy files to throw off copying attempts, and youve got one tough console 
  to mess with.</p>
<p>When the GameCube was released, people immediately began trying to find ways 
  to begin home development on the system, much of this research was in vain until 
  Sega announced plans to bring <i>Phantasy Star Online Episodes 1 & 2</i> to the 
  GameCube. Nintendo released the Modem and Broadband Adaptors when PSO was released, 
  and people quickly jumped on the chance to network their GameCube to a PC  
  opening a whole new realm of access to the console.</p>
<p><br>
  <font size="4"><strong>Phantasy Star Online: An Orgy of Bits</strong></font><br>
  If you dont know by now, you may be wondering why PSO was such a stepping 
  stone in terms of GameCube piracy. Why would a Sega game, of all games, be the 
  key? Well there is one very simple answer to a complex question: Network configurability.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/wanlan.jpg" width="450" height="100"></div>
<p>Releasing PSO with the ability to configure every aspect of your network (IP 
  address, Subnet Mask, Gateway, and DNS servers) was no doubt a risk Nintendo 
  / Sega had to take. However, this was also essential to connecting the GameCube 
  to the PC and not the Sega master server, as originally intended.</p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a perfect world, a cable modem 
  would be connected directly into your Broadband Adaptor, and it would auto detect 
  your IP settings and connect to the Sega servers  which works. The reason 
  manual configuration was included was so you could connect to a LAN network, 
  and use a shared internet connection  meaning the GameCube was always 
  meant to be connected to a PC workstation in the event this needed to be done. 
  Its notable to mention that the recently released <i>Phantasy Star Online 
  III</i> appears to only support WAN connections, and it seems Nintendo and Sega 
  have corrected the piracy issue with this new release.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  <strong><font size="4">Establishing a Connection</font></strong></font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/standard.jpg" width="450" height="100"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  When homebrew development began, a program was released (for the purposes of 
  this article, we will call it <em>Program A</em>) that could connect to the 
  GameCube and upload homebrewed code. Before <em>Program A</em> would work however, 
  the connection protocols and ports that the GameCube used had to be discovered. 
  There are commonly used ports and routines for this. In essence, networking 
  between a GameCube and a PC was born.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How were these homebrewed programs 
  loaded? Whether it be from a buffer overflow (as common on the Xbox, which is 
  how the homebrew front began there), or PSOs rumoured ability to accept 
  executable code on each subsequent server connection, programs can be loaded 
  once the system is fooled into connecting to your PC via <em>Program A</em>.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/program_a.jpg" width="450" height="100"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The obvious, but never admitted goal 
  of the initial homebrew coders was to find a way to copy GameCube games, then 
  reload those games without the use of the original disc. Thus, <em>Programs 
  B, C, </em>and<em> D</em> were born. <em>Program B</em> was a simple disc browser 
   allowing users to swap discs and browse a list of files located on a 
  GameCube disc. <em>Program C</em> was also simple as it allowed the browsing, 
  download, and subsequent upload of files from and to a GameCube memory card. 
  Between the releases of <em>Program C </em>and<em> D</em> were the first releases 
  of GameCube game images, no one knew for sure how these came about for quite 
  some time, until <em>Program D</em>, which allowed the ability to stream all 
  the data from a GameCube disc was released. The final program, <em>E</em>, was 
  released soon after. This program allowed the loading of game images to the 
  GameCube  bringing about the beginning of the <i>illegal</i> side of homebrew 
  coding.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br>
  The Evolution of a Revolution</strong></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  As homebrewers got more and more into GameCube customization and exploitation, 
  all the previously mentioned programs were combined into one central GUI tool 
  (Graphical User Interface), as everything before was done through the command 
  prompt. The introduction of a central program (well call <em>F</em>) 
  allowed a standard (albeit amateur) user to illegally rip, and load GameCube games through 
  the PSO-Exploit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An interesting tidbit with the GameCube 
  is the region free play of PSO-Exploit games. If a Japanese or PAL version of 
  a game is loaded, an NTSC GameCube will play them without problem and the game-saves from the other regions can also be saved on your NTSC formatted card.  This occurs without any corruption errors as if they were the actual discs in the system.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/loading.jpg" width="450" height="100"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Program F</em> has since become 
  upgraded to a point where games can be illegally ripped with the ease of clicking only 
  one button.  A database of settings for loading individual games has also been 
  incorporated, ensuring the best possible results are displayed on your television 
  screen. Furthermore, amateur piracy has been growing  which has led to 
  rumours that this is the very reason PSO 1 & 2 is no longer available. Or 
  that the extremely limited supply of Broadband Adapters at retailers may be 
  a direct result of this as well.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The list of tools for GameCube homebrewing 
  are growing as well  an NES emulator has been written allowing users to 
  load up certain NES ROMs (only a certain type of mapper is compatible) the same 
  way they would load a GameCube game via the PSO-Exploit. The NES games are loaded 
  entirely in the GameCubes RAM and played internally on the 'Cube, whereas 
  GameCube images are streamed from the PC as if it were one giant GoD.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most notably however, is the rather 
  new but evolving illegal Nintendo 64 emulation on the GameCube (games are also loaded entirely 
  into memory, unfortunately imposing a size limit to the ROM). When Nintendo 
  released the <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time & Master Quest</i> for the GameCube, a professional 
  homebrewer sought out to isolate the loader for the games  as it was 
  widely believed that the games were simply being emulated onto the GameCube.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This was found to be true and after 
  a few weeks, an N64 loader was released that supported a very small array of 
  first generation games  the only ones that worked were Nintendo made, 
  as they all ran on similar engines. The working games of the initial release 
  included Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, Ocarina of Time, and a few others like Pilot 
  Wings and Mario Tennis. Since that release, it has evolved into supporting more 
  and more games like Duke Nukem 64 and Super Smash Brothers. Apparently all of 
  these N64 games run almost flawlessly, and save games are created on your memory 
  card with each respective game name in the title area. Needless to say it has 
  evolved quite a bit and shows no signs of slowing down. It is widely believed 
  that the second Zelda Collectors disc, the one that includes Majoras 
  Mask, will support an even wider array of N64 games due to the increased size 
  of the Majoras Mask ROM.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Projects are in the works to illegally port 
  SNES games to the GameCube (sources say Super Bomberman is currently the only working 
  game, but suffers major slowdown and sound errors), and a GBA emulator is also 
  being toyed with.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4"><br>
  Thinking Outside the Cube</font></strong><br>
  Now that the GameCube tools are evolving steadily, other utilities are being 
  created on the PC side of things. A GameCube image browser is available, allowing 
  you to pick out certain files and directories and load them on to your hard 
  drive. You want that intro movie from Jedi Outcast? No problem. A certain sound 
  file from Mario Sunshine? Theres a GameCube sound converter out there 
  for direct rips. Ever wanted to browse the internet with the PSO browser? Well 
  you can, and somewhat successfully as well. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite this, the games are far from perfect. Sometimes they load very slowly  the videos are choppy, and the game 
  play, while most of the time perfect, has occasional slowdowns and tends to 
  lock up the Cube. Illegally ripping a game from a disc takes approximately an hour, and 
  the file sizes are upwards of 1.4GB  although there are tools to remove 
  excess garbage data (mentioned earlier), they take time to apply.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The PC side of 'Cube development doesnt 
  stop there. Recently, the same guys who got Linux running on the Xbox have also 
  gotten it to boot on the GameCube with Ethernet capabilities - basic kernel booting 
  and a NFS file structure with full Windows X support. Their future hopes are 
  to support streaming media and a full O/S through a loadable image.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4"><br>
  What it all Boils Down to</font></strong><br>
  <img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/pirate.gif" width="160" height="140" align="left" alt="Arr ... thar be homebrew on tha horizon">GameCube homebrewing 
  is more than just piracy  in fact, piracy is a small but significant 
  part of the entire scene, creating a competition between pro-piracy versus pro-development. 
  While amateur users will simply want to use the method for illegally copying and loading 
  games, the enthusiasts and developers truly interested in the system will use 
  it to their benefit, programming and porting code to work on the GameCube console.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The development of open source projects 
  on the GameCube is a first for Nintendo fans; allowing user created games to 
  be run on the hardware without any physical modifications to the system itself, 
  the PSO-Exploit may very well be beneficial to those parties who wish to further 
  expand their knowledge of console programming.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The homebrew initiative on the GameCube 
  is still in its infancy and this article will be updated when new developments 
  and breakthroughs in legal homebrewing occur.</font></p>
