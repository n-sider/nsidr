<p><b>N-Side The Game</b>

<p><b>Worlds</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Episode 1</b>
<li>Forest - The first world and customed for beginners. A very tranquil setting filled with slow moving monsters.
<li>Caves - Dark inner terrain filled with several poisonous enemies.
<li>Mines - Futuristic mines full of circuits and all sorts of new age technology. Robot guardians are trained to kill anything insight.
<li>Temple - The final and most difficult level of Episode 1.
<br>
<li><b>Episode 2</b>
<li>Beach - New world where players can now fight on the shallow waters. Physics come into play both in the sand and shallow water movement.
<li>Sanctuary Surface - Remodded from its original form. Once only used for battle modes in the Dreamcast original (version 2). Now on the GameCube Episode 2, it's a full blown level.
<li>Jungle - A savage and cluttered darker cousin of the Forest level. Featuring some of the toughest enemies.
<li>High Top Planes - Taking place high on top of all the other worlds. Elevation and constant inclines and declines are very present.
  </ul>

<p><b>Characters</b>

<p><b>Rangers</b> - Artillery based offense. Great attack range and accuracy from long range but weaker in close combat.<br><ul><li><b>Type:</b> RAmarl, RAcaseal, RAcast, RAmarl.</ul>

<p><b>Hunters</b> - Weapon based offense. Extremely agile and dangerous in close range combat. Weakness very apparent in long range attacks.<br><ul><li><b>Type:</b> HUmar, HUnewearl, HUcast, HUcaseal.</ul>

<p><b>Force</b> - Weapon and magic based offense. Magic attacks and staff weapons give the Force class the ability to combine the strengths of the other two though neither as good. <br><ul><li><b>Type:</b> FOmarl, FOnewm, FOmar, FOnewearl.</ul>

<p><b>Outlook</b>

<p><i>Phantasy Star Online</i> was an amazing experience on the Dreamcast. I was initially unconvinved that the game would run smoothly online, but was happily proven wrong when I became addicted to one of the smoothest and most intuitive online experiences I have ever had. Unfortunately, I missed out on the minor update titled <i>Phantasy Star Online Version 2</i> on the Dreamcast which was basically a bug fix and added new things like the ultimate mode and the long awaited battle mode. This new GameCube version is NOT a port ladies and gentleman! It is including the original version 1 and version 2 compiled in Episode 1, alongside a new set of worlds in the GameCube sequel Episode 2. On top of the Chapter 2 levels, the game also has a host of new characters, expanded options, enhanced visuals for the older levels (new levels obviously are going to take advantage of the GameCube hardware), new music, and even a 4-player splitscreen offline option. I can only hope to control my anticipation and await the game's tentative Summer to Fall American release date.
