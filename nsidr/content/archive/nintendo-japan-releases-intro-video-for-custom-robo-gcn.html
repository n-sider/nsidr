<p>Nintendo Japan has released the intro movie for the as yet unreleased GameCube title <i>Custom Robo</i>.</p>

<p>You can download the video from Nintendo of Japan's official <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ngc/gxcj/movie/movies/OP.wmv">Custom Robo GameCube webpage</a>.</p>

<p><i>Custom Robo</i> is a sci-fi role-playing game featuring an extensive first player story and multiplayer modes. In the game, players get to customize their own battle robot using more than 200 different body parts and weapons and then put it to the test against other robots in one of the game's 30 battle arenas.  <i>Custom Robo</i> successfully combines two highly addictive gameplay elements - Pokmon-style roleplaying and one-on-one shooting action - into one package.</p>

<p>Nintendo's <i>Custom Robo</i> series originated on the Nintendo 64 from developer Noise and agent Marigul. The Nintendo 64 versions of the game never saw release outside of Japan.</p>
