<P>Super Smash Brothers for the N64 managed to garner a very strong following.  With arguably the most addictive and entertaining multiplayer modes available on the system, SSB completely consumed the lives of many members of the gaming public.  When Super Smash Brothers Melee was announced and shown for the GameCube, these uber-fans all simultaneously messed themselves.  With new levels, new characters, new items, and graphics that simply blow the mind, SSBM has the potential to eclipse the original in every way.  And when a game is anticipated to this extent, sometimes a mere preview won't cut it.</P>



<P>As such, N-Sider is proud to present the most in-depth and accurate coverage of Super Smash Brothers Melee currently available.  Level descriptions, new character moves, advanced techniques, and more.  Use the navigation bar on the right to move through the pages, and be sure to check back periodically.  Whenever any new SSBM info hits the net, you can be sure that this feature will update accordingly.</P>

    <TD WIDTH="300">Thanks to N-Sider reader Peter Hudson, I've been directed to a great site that's more or less a direct translation of the official Japanese SSBM site.  Being able to read the site without having to resort to laughable internet translators proved a very valuable experience, as I managed to find loads of new info that I had simply overlooked before.  I've updated pretty much every page of the feature with these new tidbits, so start browsing again.  You just might stumble upon something you didn't know before.<BR>
