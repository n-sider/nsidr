<H3>Secret Characters</H3>



<P>The original Super Smash Brothers had 4 secret characters; Jigglypuff, Captain Falcon, Luigi, and Ness.  While two of those four have made it back into SSBM as standard characters, the other two have joined an additional <B>nine</B> to make up the new roster of secret characters.  Current screens of the player select screen only allow for a total of five secret characters, so check the mockups below to see what the finalized screens will probably resemble.</P>

<P>At the moment, N-Sider can only confirm three of these eleven secret characters.  The rest will have to wait until the game is officially released, though you can make some guesses based on the potential characters list.</P>

<P><B>Potential Secret Characters</B></P>



<UL>

<LI>New Pokmon.  One particular Pocket Monster was originally planned for inclusion in the original SSB, but he was scrapped at the last moment.  I wouldn't be surprised to see him pop up in SSBM, nor would I be surprised to see a new addition from the Gold/Silver edition of the game.

<LI>More characters from old Nintendo franchises, akin to the Ice Climbers.  Characters from Balloon Fight and Excitebike have been officially de-confirmed by NCL's official SSBM site, so they're a definite no-no.  There might be something from even farther back in Nintendo's past, however.  After all, SSBM is being pegged as a compilation of Nintendo's history, what with the massive gallery mode and all.  Anything's possible.

<LI>Characters known only to Japanese audiences.  There are several Nintendo franchises that never made it to American shores, and characters from these games could definitely find their way into SSBM.  Before you screech in outrage about characters you've never heard about and don't care about, just keep in mind.  This <I>is</I> a Japanese game, after all.  HAL would be a fool not to cater to their homeland audience.

<LI>Some more characters that will most likely make gamers exclaim, "What on earth were they thinking?!"

  </ul>



<P>And a bit more de-confirmation.  Rumors have been flying around about which characters could be available in SSBM.  I'll say right now that no characters from any second-party games, such as Banjo-Kazooie, will be included, nor will any from any third-party games.  That means no Diddy Kong, no Joanna Dark, and certainly no Sonic the Hedgehog.  Also, from what I can tell, Pit from Kid Icarus isn't a playable character either.</P>
