<P>SSBM naturally has quite a few new items that you can exploit in battle.  Like in the original SSB, there is an Item Switch option in the configuration menu that allows you to turn certain items on or off, but it is unknown if you have to manually unlock this mode somehow.  Anyways, on with the items.</P>

<LI><B>Heart Container</B> - Restores 100% worth of health

<LI><B>Ray Gun</B> - Fires large blasts of energy with the A button

<LI><B>Beam Sword</B> - A light saber that apparently varies in size depending upon who holds it

<LI><B>Home-Run Bat</B> - If used in conjuction with a forward smash, the bat can kill someone in a single hit

<LI><B>Green Shell</B> - A turtle shell that can knock a person very far if thrown at them

<LI><B>Red Shell</B> - A turtle shell that slides back and forth over the ground between the edges of whatever it's on

<LI><B>Flipper</B> - From Balloon Fight, a two-pronged device that you can place in the air to knock away characters

<LI><B>Freezie</B> - From the original Mario Brothers, this block of ice slides across the ground until it hits someone, at which point it freezes them in place.

<LI><B>Mr Saturn</B> - A little guy from Earthbound, Mr Saturn can be used as a projectile, and he collects other items in his free time

<LI><B>Pokball</B> - Throw a Pokball, and a Pokmon will come out and do your bidding.  The Pokmon in SSBM include Seaking, Lugia, Charizard, Blastoise, Snorlax, Wheezing, Chikorita, Entei, Scizor, Unown, Wombuffet, Voltorb, Bellossom, Articuno, and Moltres.

<LI><B>Bob-omb</B> - If left alone, this bomb will start to walk around.  If thrown as a projectile, it will knock someone FAR away on impact.

<LI><B>Motion Sensor Bomb</B> - After being placed on a surface, it explodes upon contact with another character or item

<LI><B>Starman</B> - Grants temporary invincibility

<LI><B>Parasol</B> - Helps you come back from the edge by slowing your decent

<LI><B>Paper Ball</B> - If thrown, will raise itself into the air and drop food all over the level.  Occasionally, however, it'll drop a bunch of Bob-ombs instead.  You'll have to be careful if you don't want to be nuked.

<LI><B>Kirby's Star</B> - Flies your character into the air, and smashes them down on one other character

<LI><B>Mushroom</B> - Causes your character to grow in size, increasing their strength in the process.  There's a small chance of it actually shrinking your character, though, and taking away from your strength.

<LI><B>Fire Flower</B> - Burns enemies until it runs out

<LI><B>Super Scope 6</B> - The SNES accessory returns!  Can either shoot rapid fire, or charge up and shoot a larger blast.

<LI><B>Hammer</B> - Whoever gets the hammer is near-invincible and can knock a person out with only a couple hits.  The hammer can be broken if attacked correctly, however, rendering the user vulnerable to attack.  The hammer effect is temporary.

<LI><B>Star Rod</B> - Launches stars if used with a directional attack, knocks enemies downwards if thrown

<LI><B>Paper Fan</B> - You can use the fan to quickly hit the enemy, and usually hold them in one place.  It's very good at breaking shields, and knocks an enemy straight up in the air if thrown at them.

<LI><B>Bunny Hood</B> - From the N64 Zelda games, the Bunny Hood increases your character's speed and jumping ability.

<LI><B>Screw Attack Powerup</B> - A black ball with Samus' logo on it, this powerup allows any character to perform Samus' Screw Attack every time they jump.

<LI><B>Cloaking Device</B> - Makes your character largely invisible, leaving only a slight distortion in the background to be seen.

<LI><B>Metal Cap</B> - Straight out of Super Mario 64, this cap gives you the same resistance to attacks as Metal Mario in the original SSB.
