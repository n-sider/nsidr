<H3>Multiplayer Levels</H3>



<P>The multiplayer levels in SSBM are designed to inspire the most hectic battles imaginable.  While the levels in the original SSB were relatively static and only had a couple moving platforms, the levels in SSBM have become increasingly interactive.  Some of them can be broken into multiple pieces, and others have elements that occasionally just fall apart.  Also, may levels have things going on in them completely independently of what the characters are doing.  Cars race down the track in the Mute City stage, acid occasionally rises on Brinstar, and Kremlings jump through the rapids in the Kongo Jungle.  It's not just for atmosphere, though.  If you don't look out, the denizens of the level that you're battling in can deal you some serious damage.</P>



<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-levelselect.jpg"></P>



<P>SSBM gives you 18 stages to choose from at the start, and there are 5 more waiting to be unlocked.  The levels are all based around specific franchises in the Nintendo universe, and each franchise has two stages that correspond to it.  For example, the Kirby franchise spawns the Fountain of Dreams level as well as the Whispy Woods level.  The Ice Climbers franchise is the only exception to the rule, having only one stage to call its own.</P>

Just like in the NES game, this stage continually scrolls upwards and downwards.  If you don't keep up, you're toast.  Should make for some very frantic battles.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Princess Peach's Castle:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-mariostage1.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

No longer taking place up high in the sky like in the original SSB, this level is one of the larger stages in SSBM.  There are two floating platforms on either edge of the castle roof, and the main spire juts out significantly in the middle of the stage.  Several buttons around the level cause the platforms to rise and fall, while other buttons launch huge Bullet Bills at the level, which burrow into the surroundings and explode.

Taken directly from the last level in Super Mario 64, characters battle it out on this flying ship.  It continually scrolls forward, so if you fall off the back you'll have trouble getting back on.

The Kongo Jungle stage takes place on a series of log platforms over a raging river.  The barrel from DK's stage in the original SSB returns, moving much quicker this time.  A Claptrap occasionally swims down the river and jumps into the barrel, injuring anyone in the way and preventing them from using the barrel.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Treehouse:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-dkstage3.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

This level also takes place over a river, but this time the water can rise and injure the players.  It's got the nice sunset background found in the original DK level in SSB, but the music is a rendition of the "DK Rap" found in the beginning sequence of Donkey Kong 64.  As such, let us never speak of it again.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Great Bay:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-zeldastage1.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

Taken directly from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, this stage pits characters against each other on an island off the coast of Termina.  Tingle the map salesman is floating around waiting to be knocked down, and the turtle on the right side of the screen will leave if you hit him too much.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Temple:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-zeldastage5.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

Originally assumed to be at least three separate stages, this level is in fact one <I>gigantic</I> floating island.  A completely fabricated location based loosely on the surroundings found in Zelda 2 on the NES, this level is an assortment of well constructed ares, some ruined architecture, and other areas with rocks and soil.  It's definitely the largest level in the game, far exceeding the width of the Great Fox in the original SSB.  It should be interesting to see if it remains playable when players stretch it to its limit.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Yoshi's Story:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-yoshistage.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

Yoshi's it somewhat similar to Kirby's stage in the original SSB.  There are several platforms over a main arena, which is fairly small.  There are clouds on either end of the stage, and Shyguys occasionally fly by with food.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Super Mario World:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-yoshistage2.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

A brand new level, this stage is based on Super Mario World on the SNES.  A giant Bullet Bill occasionally flies across the screen, and you can get items by hitting blocks from underneath.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Fountain of Dreams:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-kirbystage1.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

This stage is very simple, with a small main area below three small platforms.  The platforms on the sides periodically rise and lower on top of jets of water.

  </TD>

  </TR>

  <TR> 

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Whispy Woods:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-kirbystage3.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

This stage is a remake of Kirby's level in the original SSB.  The tree returns in the middle, and there are now two additional areas on either side of the main island.  In between the three areas, star blocks fall and block off the pits.  If a bomb block falls, it can be hit to destroy all of the star blocks.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Corneria:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-starfoxstage1.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

This stage is largely identical to the one in the original SSB, except that now the Great Fox is significantly smaller than it used to be.  As it flys through Corneria it occasionally charges up and shoots its main guns, and Arwings periodically pass by.

  </TD>

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Venom:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-starfoxstage3.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

For this stage, the Great Fox is flying directly at the screen.  You battle it out on its four sets of wings as it flys through various environments on Venom.  Occasionally Star Wolf ships fly by, blasting anyone in their way.

Brinstar is much smaller than it was in the original SSB.  The stage can be broken in half if enough force is applied to the center, and the acid still rises periodically to injure anyone around.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Onett:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-earthboundstage1.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

Onett is a small city in Earthbound on SNES.  In the SSBM level, you jump on rooftops, awnings, and trees, trying to avoid the cars the screech by below.  At several points during the match, a sign at the top of a building will fall down, causing the awning platforms to collapse.

  </TD>

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Fourside:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-earthboundstage2.jpg">Screenshot</A> (Secret Level)<BR>

This level takes place on top of some skyscrapers in the midst of Fourside - a very large city in Earthbound.  There's even a UFO for you to fight on top of.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Mute City:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-fzerostage.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

Mute City is one of the more interesting stages.  You fight on several platforms over the race track until those platforms drop into the ground.  Then a new platform comes up, and zooms over the course.  If you're not on it when it leaves, you're dead.  It then eventually settles down on a new section of the track and the process repeats.  All the while, race cars are zipping by and damaging anyone who gets in the way.

  </TD>

  </TR> 

  <TR>

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Big Blue:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-fzerostage2.jpg">Screenshot</A> (Secret Level)<BR>

Like Mute City, players will traverse the entire track while they battle.  This time, however, they're running the whole way.  You can apparently ride on top of the cars as they pass by, and it remains to be seen how you can interact with the cylindrical areas of the track.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Pokmon Stadium:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-pokemonstage.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

The Pokmon Stadium stage has two small platforms above it, and a giant screen in the background that shows all of the action that's going on.  Occasionally the level will morph into different locations, significantly altering the layout.

    <TD WIDTH="400" BGCOLOR="lightgrey"><B>Super Mario Brothers:</B> <A HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ssbm-nd-retrostage1.jpg">Screenshot</A><BR>

A remake of the Mario Brothers stage in the original SSB, this rendition is a pixel-perfect rendition of the original Super Mario Brothers on the NES.  Pipes transport you across the stage, and two hanging platforms are connected by a line and act like a scale if a character steps on one of them.

  </TD>

Possibly Subcon from Super Mario Brothers 2, but that's only a rumor at this point.</TD>
