<P>The original Super Smash Brothers started you off with 8 famed Nintendo mascots to choose from.  SSBM nearly doubles that number with a total of 14 characters right from the get go.  This includes all of the original base characters in SSB, two of the original secret characters, and 4 newbies.  Add in 11 secret characters, and you've got one hell of a cast.</P>



<P>The next few pages will shed a bit more light on the starting lineup in SSBM, as well as provide some insight on the potential secret characters.</P>

Mario was one of the most well-rounded characters in the original SSB, and the same looks to be true this time around.  His attacks are quick and effective, he can perform a variety of evasive acrobatics, and he's very good at coming back from the edge after being knocked off.  Add in his new cape attack that can reflect projectiles, and a new meteor smash that can knock enemies straight down at incredible speeds, and Mario has very few weaknesses.  But what else would you expect from Nintendo's most prized mascot?</P>

Pikachu is all about speed.  He can run up to you, knock you in the air, hit you 4 times, and teleport a full stage away before you even know what hit you.  The majority of his most effective attacks involve dashing at the enemy and hitting them with his head, which is exactly what his new Side-B attack does.  Plus, his thunder attack can hit enemies right before they fly off the top of the screen, making him a very effective kill-stealer.  His smash attacks suffer slightly, having either limited range or limited speed, but his agility more than makes up for it.</P>

Bowser makes his SSB premiere as one of the slow heavy-hitters.  His size makes for very powerful attacks, but he can't get around very quickly.  Some of his more effective techniques involve sliding across the screen towards an enemy while deflecting projectiles, and simply falling over and crushing enemies.  The finer details of how he handles aren't known at the moment, but only because he wasn't playable in the original SSB.</P>

Accompanying Samus as the second female character in the game, Peach's moves are very similar to those she had in Super Mario Brothers 2.  For example, she can pull turnips out of the ground and toss them at her enemies, and she can float horizontally across the screen for an extended period of time.  Peach isn't so much focused on powerful attacks as she is on coming back to the stage after being knocked off.  With her floating ability and parasol, Peach will always manage to find a way to get back.</P>

Yoshi has always been about defense.  He can't be knocked out of his second jump, and his shield puts him in an egg that still protects him while he rolls.  In SSBM, he also gains the ability to jump and move around while still inside the egg.  However, he's still fairly slow, and his jumps are difficult to deal with.  Especially since he doesn't have a third jump.  Usually his strong smashes can keep him in the game, but it takes a lot of practice to get good at the guy.</P>

Next to Bowser, Donkey Kong is the largest character in the game.  He relies largely upon brute strength to beat up on his opponents.  One advantage of this strength is that he can pick up characters and carry them before throwing them.  This also allows him to grab someone and jump off the edge, pulling his unfortunate foe down with him.  Don't expect to be making any friends with that particular move.  It's also worth noting that since DK has one of the largest faces, you'll be seeing a lot of emotion out of the guy.  If his taunt is any indication, funny monkey faces will flow freely.</P>

If you hit B again while winding up, Donkey Kong will unleash his giant punch.  After he's charged up to the max level, he'll sparkle slightly.  At that point, pressing B won't charge up any more.

Captain Falcon was an interesting case in the original SSB.  A racer from F-Zero, he had no particular powers that could be exploited in a fighting game.  Leave it to HAL to give him some of the most damaging attacks around.  Captain Falcon is one of the quickest guys in the game.  Put him in a straight out sprint against anyone, and he'll leave them in the dust.  It's an odd compromise, since the majority of his attacks take a long time to execute.  The Falcon Punch, though devastating, takes a very long time to wind up.  It's a similar case with many of his other attacks.  If you can get the timing down, however, Falcon can be a force to be reckoned with.</P>
