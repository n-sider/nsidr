<H3>Adventure Mode</H3>



<P>Super Smash Brothers Melee's brand new Adventure mode lets you play through classic Nintendo locales in a sidescrolling fashion.  While the finalized game is sure to have many of these levels to explore, we currently only know about a few of them.  Forgive the blurry shots - they were taken via a handheld camcorder.</P>

<P>Princess Peach's Castle is a romp through the Mushroom Kingdom.  You start by coming out of a pipe, and proceed to fight off Koopas and Goombas as you progress through the stage.  Halfway through, you'll have to face off against the Yoshi team from the original SSB.  After jumping over some more pipes and platforms, you end this part of the level by walking past the flagpole (taken directly from Super Mario Brothers).  Lastly, you have to fight Mario and Peach atop the Peach's Castle multiplayer stage.</P>

<P>Taken straight from the Legend of Zelda games, this level has you wandering through an underground dungeon.  You must battle through Octoroks and ReDeads as you progress, and you end up fighting Link 4 times in miniature battle arenas.</P>

<P>This level starts you out fighting Samus on the Brinstar multiplayer stage.  Once you defeat her, you must escape the planet before it explodes.  Just like in the end of Super Metroid on SNES, you must leap from platform to platform in order to reach the surface of the planet before the whole place goes to hell.</P>
