Famitsu magazine has gathered several Japanese analysts to offer their thoughts and speculation on the next-generation consoles. IT journalist Hiroshige Gotoh said he feels Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> will be successful due to its innovation and unique controller.  He concludes that these advantages will successfully compete with the technology focus of competitors, similar to how the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> has been consistently outselling the Sony PSP.<br><br>

Senior Analyst Eiji Maeda believes the Revolution could be available in Japan as early as June for around $250.  Despite such a quick release, he also feels the Revolution will debut with a larger software launch than that of which will be available for the PlayStation 3.  Meanwhile, Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> recently said he hopes to have the Nintendo Revolution available in North America before Thanksgiving.  Adding to this is Achim Schmaus, Nintendo's new European brand manager, who will be "responsible for the pan-European marketing activities for the next-generation home console which launches in 2006."<br><br>

2006 it is.
