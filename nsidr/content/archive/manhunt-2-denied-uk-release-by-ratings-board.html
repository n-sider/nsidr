MCV has the news this morning that Rockstar's ultraviolent <i>Manhunt 2</i>&mdash;contender for the highest level of potential controversy ever&mdash;has been <a href="http://www.mcvuk.com/news/27545/BBFC-rejects-Manhunt-2">rejected</a> by the BBFC, meaning the game will not be able to be legally stocked on UK shelves.<br />
<br />
"Rejecting a work is a very serious action and one which we do not take lightly," said David Cooke, BBFC director. "Where possible we try to consider cuts or, in the case of games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's published Guidelines.<br />
<br />
"In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible."<br />
<br />
Manhunt 2 is likely one of the fruits of Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime's lobbying of Take Two to make games for Wii.  The title is also being released on PlayStation 2; the Wii version has motion controls simulating the graphic killings and enhanced graphics added.  Both versions of the game were rejected by the BBFC.
