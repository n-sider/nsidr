The latest Famitsu <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3149-1.jpg">revealed</a> a new DS game from Sting, the developer of <i>Riviera: The Promised Land</i> and <i>Yggdra Union: We'll Never Fight Alone</i>, two GBA games previously brought to America by Atlus and since ported to PSP. Sting's new game, <i>Knights in the Nightmare</i>, is currently planned for a 2008 release in Japan. An American release is currently unconfirmed. The game features the following:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>The main character is a wisp, who takes control of knights by charming them and giving orders.</li>
  <li>It is a "turn-based RTS"&mdash;each turn (both offensive and defensive) is time based and plays out in real time, but it controls like a turn-based trategy game.</li>
  <li>The top screen shows the gameplay while the bottom screen shows a wire-map of the battlefield.</li>
  <li>Players control the wisp with the stylus and use it to give knights orders.</li>
  <li>Demons will aim for the wisp. Players have to avoid the demons, like in a shooting game.</li>
  <li>The heroine is a female knight named Maria.</li>
  <li>It is the fourth entry in the "Department Heaven Episode" series&mdash;the first being Riviera, the second being Yggdra Union, and the third being unknown.</li>
  <li>Shinichi Itou is the game director. He directed previous entries in the series.</li>
  <li>Satoku Kiyuzuki is responsible for design creation. He was the main character designer for Yggdra Union.</li>
  <li>Sunaho Tobe is handling illustration. He was the main character designer for Riviera and illustrated the cards in Yggdra Union.</li>
  </ul><br />
