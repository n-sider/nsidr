<h3>Tracking a Dream - Press Start To Play</h3>

<p>Looks like we gotta real hot mic here. <i>Hot mic.</i> Hey everyone. 
How's it goin'. Just answer silenty to yourself because I can't hear you 
anyway. This is my first time writing for N-Sider. My first time writing 
ever actually, so things may get a little awkward. If at anytime during the 
procedure you feel uncomfortable just imagine me in my underwear.

<h3>The Life and Times of a Budding Game Designer</h3>

<p>Now that most of you left, I will direct the rest of my comments to the 
few that bravely stuck around. I am going to try and write a series of 
articles/journal entries documenting my <i>Adventures in the Game Design 
Industry</i>. While I haven't made it there yet, that is what the focus of 
these writings will be. I am going to attempt to get a job in the industry 
and take you every step of the way. I know a lot of you out there would love 
a position making video games for a living. However, unlike a lot of you, I 
am actually take steps to make that a reality, and failing a lot along the 
way. However tragic they may be, I am going to share my failures and 
successes with you all in hopes of helping you avoid my stupidity. Perhaps 
along the way I can teach someone a thing or two.

<p>As this is my introduction entry, I thought I would let you guys in on a 
little about me and my world. (If there are any small children with heart 
conditions that are present, please leave the room 'til the end of the 
presentation. If you are one of these people, please take this time to yell 
at God for toying with your lives.) Since I have no friends and my family 
doesn't like me, I will be conducting the interview myself. Here goes and I 
hope you will join me inside my head for the adventure that lies ahead 
(pictures of me included).

<p><h3>Press start to play</h3>

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Hi Matthew, it's 
good to have you here with us today. Don't even think about leaving with my 
pen because you'll be frisked on your way out as well as several times 
before, during, and after the interview.  With that said, tell us a little 
about yourself!

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Thanks Matt, it's good to 
be here. I've never done anything like this before, I'm a little nervous. 
And if I touch your pen for any reason it will be to stab you in the eye.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Touche. Everyone 
may be most familar with you by your work on Reading Rainbow as the 
endearing Lavar Burton. Tell us what it was like to play him and if you 
share any similarities with the character.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Huh...TV is sin. And I am 
white. I am an artist on the N-Sider website. It's such a wonderful place to 
work and the people are so kind-hearted. (actual opinions may vary)  The 
first thing I did for the site was the set of "Ganon eyes". Now I hope to be 
doing a lot more work on N-Universe and really whipping that into shape.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> How did you get 
the books to move like that? It doesn't work, I've tried. Lavar's belly must 
be full of magic.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Can I borrow your pen for 
a second?

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Ha! No... So 
tell me, why do you want to be a part of the gaming industry? Aside from the 
obvious perks such as fame and women. Of course by fame I mean the fact that 
only your fellow co-workers know you (fame gained from the sound your nerf 
gun makes when you unload on them) and by women, I mean overweight male 
gamers with a C-cup.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Well I think, like a lot 
of people, games have really touched my life growing up. They have been a 
huge influence since I can remember. My first video game memories are 
playing <i>Donkey Kong</i> on the ColecoVision. There was also this game 
called <i>Looping</i> which I just loved. In the game you controlled a plane 
that had to shoot ballons and avoid pipes. Crazyness.

<p>I lived in a trailer with my six brothers and sisters (three brothers, 
three sisters) and my parents. I'm the youngest out of everyone. We didn't 
have a lot of money. I remember wanting a <i>Voltron</i> so badly, he was 
roughly about my height at the time. But my folks just couldn't afford it so 
I had to build one out of Legos. I took him to preschool and some fat kid 
ate it. Video games were my source of entertainment, aside from tea parties 
with the neighbor chick (and yes they really did happen, dandylion necklaces 
and all).  There was also swimming in the yard when it rained a lot. The 
storm drain would get stopped up and the yard would fill with water. There's 
nothing like frolicking in water and seeing a dog turd float past your 
head...

<p>I used to do a lot of spider catching as a kid.  There were big banana 
spiders in our yard. Huge yellow and black demons and if you weren't careful 
you would walk face first into them in tall grass. If you've ever played 
<i>The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time</i> you know what I am talking 
about. I would catch them in jars and throw them into the creek and watch 
them suffer...red eyes...demons...sorry, I get off track.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Oh sorry, I was 
rubbing my initials into my arm with my eraser. Ha, look!  We have the same 
initials.  What did you say?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Nothing. I think I'm 
leaving

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Wait, I still 
have a lot of things to ask you.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Could you please not put 
your hand on my thigh?

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Oh...right...I 
just thought you were giving me all the signals. When someone points to 
their leg and says "Touch this" the signal turns green for me.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Ask me something else.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Well, you never 
answered the first question so why don't we go back to that, hmm? Maybe you 
should put on your helmet so you don't hurt yourself this time.

<p>So tell me, why videogames?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Well, if I were to really 
say what I want to say about games I think it would upset a lot of people. 
But I guess I should be honest with my fan base, they both deserve it. I 
guess I feel the same as other game players in that games could be better. 
Developers really need to take their ideas and push them further than they 
have been. That's not to say there have not been a lot of brilliant games 
out there.  I know time plays a huge factor, but I honestly feel something 
needs to be done. If I can get into the industry and show people what that 
is, then I will have met my goal.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> You're a very 
handsome fellow, has anyone ever told you that you could model?  Possibly 
for <i>Jimmy Dean's</i> selection of breakfast meats. Your face would be 
great for anything dealing with hamburger really.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> I hate you.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> So, I'm a little 
confused about what you said, making games better? Elaborate and take your 
fingers out of your mouth this time.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Well, I am just saying, 
and I know I am going to get a lot of hate mail for this. (I can be reached 
at anytime day or night at the home of Jason Nuyens. Please feel free to 
e-mail me for the number) Games like <i>Mario Sunshine</i> and <i>Metroid 
Prime</i> could have been better. A lot better. Take for example <i>Mario 
Sunshine</i>. I feel this is the weakest game in the Mario franchise. I will 
use Princess Peach for this illustration. Why was she such a cardboard 
cutout character in that game?

<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/matthewhair.jpg" width="300" height="276"

<p>I'm not a feminist by any means and whoever in the audience just called 
me <i>nancy</i> is lucky that I am wearing heels and can't run very fast or 
your a** would be grass. You know who you are. Back to my Peach comment. Why 
would anyone even want to attempt to save someone like that? Let her burn I 
say. It's like those people that save bacon grease in a can. I don't know 
what that meant but you get my point. These are characters, and are in 
desperate need of just that; <i>character</i>. Not only are they characters, 
they are Nintendo characters. We have come to expect endearing qualities. 
Characters you feel you know, you empathize with. Not this...and that's only 
the beginning of some of the problems.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> It looks like 
we're short on time and the fact that I don't care what you think makes me 
want to finish this interview later.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Matthew M:</font></b> Yeah, but I have a lot I 
wanna say...about...things.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Interviewer Matthew:</font></b> Please, no 
speaking.
<hr>
<p>And the interview continues next time. Or maybe it doesn't. I haven't 
decided. I promise the next entry will have a bit more content. As of now I 
am 22 years old. I live at home with my parents and my grandmother once told 
me I am pretty. I finished school a few months ago. I went to school for 
Computer Animation. I hope to cover my experiences later in a series of 
entries. You're in for a treat there. I am now currently working on my 
resume and portfolio and sending out applications to some potential 
companies. Some huge, some not so huge, but all equally important. We'll 
touch base on a lot of things I think are important in the game industry 
today. Hope you'll tune in next time.

<p><i>You never know where you'll end up next when you're under the Reading 
Rainbow. </i>
