<p><b>Edition: 04-19-2005</b>

<p>Honestly, I dont think Im capable of keeping the mailbag perfectly weekly (to the day). Ill do my best, but my schedule is pretty hectic as of late so just expect them sometime around the beginning of each week. Of course, Travis is here again for this edition and I even got Cory to stop by to answer a question. Enjoy. Remember to send your criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>.

<p>In this edition, we talk a bit of RPGs, yet another person has Wavebird issues, one guy seems to get suckered into believing every April Fools rumor, we list our favorite GCN and N64 games, we compare Mountain Dew to Dr. Pepper, and the inevitable Universe question finally pops up.

<h3>Revolution Processor</h3>
<p>Well, another week another seven migranes, eh?  Anyways, let me start off by saying something about last week's Letter of the Week.  I found a news bit from Gamespot.com (Even though you dudes do IGN.) and it mentioned that development kits are already out.  Now, since this news was released sometime in March, I'd assume that the companies who have the kits are already working on something. The article is seen here:

<p><a href=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/03/15/news_6120523.html> href=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/03/15/news_6120523.html</a>

<p>But that's not my question, and far from it.  Last mailbag you gave me the "supposed" specs of the next-gen consoles, and I was surprised to find that you predicted a dual-core processor for one of the systems.  Now, again, I was surfing Gamespot.com, and I found an interesting piece of hardware developed by Intel.  Namely, their Pentium Processor Extreme Edition 840, a dual-core processor.  Since this dual-core processor is out and about, and running at 3.2 GHz per processor, could it not be possible that the processor, which I think is codenamed, "Broadway" or "Hollywood", is dual-core and running at 1.5 the capability of Sony's CELL chip?  I know it's too early too tell, but it seems unlikely that Nintendo would go the way of the CELL in terms of hardware, seeing as how a dual-core is easier and cheaper to manufacture.  After all, Iwata said the specs of the Revolution would be on par or better than the other systems, did he not?

<p>Thanks once again for answering!

<p><i>- Carlito C.</i>

<p>P.S. It's nice to see that you included the Rumor Mill in the poll, I'm itching for another update.
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Well, Im not exactly sure what you are asking. If you are suggesting that Nintendo is using an Intel processor for its next system, then youre going to be disappointed. Just as it did with the GameCube, Nintendo has partnered with IBM to power its forthcoming console. Microsoft and Sony are also both working with IBM to power their consoles. In terms of specifics, the only guesses I can offer are the ones already stated in our old rumor article. I really have no idea. However, the company has continually reiterated that Revolution will be around as powerful as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Considering the fact that Nintendo has never released a technically inferior home console to date, I dont think we have anything to worry about. In reality though, judging a system on processor power alone is also a very outdated concept. Show me some demos, movies, and screenshots of what the system is capable of, because frankly spouting out numbers is pretty irrelevant to me. 

<p>As for development kits, Im sure there are several studios close to Nintendo working on next generation games. Again, I dont think it is a big concern at this point. If spring turns to summer and summer gives way to autumn with still no mass development kit movement, then it will be time to worry. I am pretty sure that wont happen though, so there isnt anything to worry about.

<h3>RPG Love</h3>
<p>I'm a huge Nintendo fan. However it's lacking in this genre badly. I don't understand why Nintendo won't go to smaller companies (Who do RPGs) and have them release a huge RPG at the Revolutions launch. I know Camelot is making a next gen RPG. But whether it is for the Revolution it is uncertain.

<p>If you check out other things. Like Namco's Tales of Symphonia for the GC. That game was amazing and it puzzles me WHY Namco hasn't released another on the GC. If they released one on the Revolution it'd do good I'm sure.

<p>Basically. I'm just saying Nintendo could get 'smaller' companies and have them do RPGs for them.

<p>Example: Level 5. This company is quickly moving up. So I'm kinda expecting Brownie Brown and a few others to do so. BTW, there was a action RPG coming to the GameCube called; Steel Hearts. I'm wondering if that was moved to the next gen consoles.

<p><i>- Sion</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Lets give Namco some credit. An RPG isnt exactly the type of game you can crank out (unless youre Square) and considering <i>Tales of Symphonia</i> just came out <i>last year</i> in North America Im not surprised there hasnt been a Cube sequel. There is a PS2 Tales game up for release this year and I suppose you could wonder why its not coming to the Cube, but Im willing to bet that game has been in development for years as it is by a separate development team. So relax, a new Tales will come to Nintendo eventually.  

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Im not familiar with <i>Steel Hearts</i>. However, I am very confident that Camelot is working on a Revolution RPG. Camelot and Nintendo share a very good relationship. Im hoping to one day see a fully 3D <i>Golden Sun</i>. And yes, like you I hope that Nintendo puts a greater emphasis on RPGs in the upcoming generation. A good RPG at launch could do wonders.

<h3>Bionic Commando Sequel</h3>
<p>Hello guys at N-Sider,

<p>Thanks for clearing that Uwe Bull isn't making the Metroid movie in the last QA. That was quite a relief.

<p>Anyways, my question is now about one of the games that I used to love back in the NES days.  Remember Bionic Commando?  That was a really great game for its time, and I think it was made by capcom.  I downloaded the ROM last year and beat it again, and it was just as fun as in the old days.  This is a game that has a lot of potential to have a sequel, with all the new technologies that are avaliable now.  So capcom being the sequelwhore that it is right now, why there is no bionic commando sequel?  have you heard any rumors on this?

<p>I had the same feeling for the ninja gaiden series and they made a new game, which made me really happy although i think the game is a bit overrated.  So yeah, no bionic commando for me?  isn't there any way to contact capcom about this? (though I doubt they'll hear me, but maybe they will hear you!)

<p><i>- Michael Molina</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Oh yesI remember <i>Bionic Commando</i>. I also remember I was horrible at playing the game when I was younger. I'd like to track it down and see how my years of gaming experience would the help the commando defeat the enemy, but I'm also a tad lazy.

<p>I'm sorry to inform you that I have heard no news, speculative or otherwise, of Capcom making a <i>Bionic Commando</i> sequel for any current or next generation console.  I would not rule out the possibility, however, as Capcom did release a brand new <i>Bionic Commando</i> game for the Game Boy Color in 2000.  It even featured a female character.  Needless to say, that title's existence is a form of acknowledgement from Capcom that they do remember the franchise exists.  If we're lucky a new installment in the series will eventually be put into production, though it always could become Capcom's <i>Kid Icarus</i>.

<h3>What Should Be in Any Top 100</h3>
<p>After reading the 8th edition of n-banter, I was given the nagging impression that you believe 3-D has ruined games. I just wanted to point out, that imho games have never sunk into such mediocre boringness until Gamecube was released. While it is true that there are less completely terrible games than there were in the days of N64. It is also true that there are no thumb-achingly brilliant games similar to the days of N64.
 
<p>Just to prove my rambling point, here is a list of games on Gamecube that I think deserve to be in any top 100: Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Prince of Persia 1, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 and Burnout 2.
 
<p>In contrast, these are the games on N64 which I think deserve to be in a top 100: Ocarina of Time, Perfect Dark, Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Mario Tennis, International Superstar Soccer 98, Rayman 2, Donkey Kong 64, Blast Corps, WWF No Mercy, Star Fox 64, Diddy Kong Racing, 1080' Snowboarding, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Silicon Valley, Mario Kart, The World is Not Enough, Jet Force Gemini and Super Smash Bros.
 
<p> (5 GC and 20 N64)
 
<p>While I may own slightly more N64 games than Gamecube games, it has always been a common theme: Gamecube games are either mind numbingly boring and unoriginal or just complete disappointments, whilst all but two N64 games (that I bought) were incredibly fun, even if they weren't of the highest quality.
 
<p>I realise that, over the course of this short letter, I have changed from a complaint against your 3-D criticisms to just generally insulting Gamecubes games. But it is a problem that should be corrected from now on (or from the Revolutions launch at least).
 
<p>Now, whilst I sit here wishing I could re-live Ocarina of Time's brilliance for the first time, I also look forward to the next Zelda, which I hope will redeem my faith after the hugely overrated "Wind Waker".

<p><i>- Mattyashy1403</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Oh my god. I sincerely hope that was a typo and you did not just list <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> as one of the best games ever. That game has to be one of the most overrated games I have ever played. It wasnt even Donkey Kong. If <i>Banjo-Kazooie</i> is the derivative of <i>Super Mario 64</i>, what do you call the derivative of the derivative? Ah yes, you call it <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>. It was the game that turned Donkey Kong into every other of Rares 3D platforming games  a collectathon. The music and feel of the game was far too reminiscent of <i>Banjo</i> and the gameplay far too bland to care about. Theres really nothing more I can say about that. 

<p>Aside from that MASSIVE miscalculation, Im here to rewire and rework your list of Nintendo 64 games for giggles. The best N64 games are as follows: <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark, Harvest Moon 64, Star Wars Rogue Squadron, Tony Hawks Pro Skater, Rayman 2: The Great Escape, Star Fox 64, Super Smash Bros., WWF No Mercy, Mario Kart 64, 1080 Snowboarding, Blast Corps., Mario Party, Mario Tennis, Jet Force Gemini, The Legend of Zelda: Majoras Mask, Space Station: Silicon Valley,</i> and <i>Conker's Bad Fur Day</i>. 

<p>I eliminated a few games (<i>The World is Not Enough</i>) and added quite a few deserving titles (<i>GoldenEye 007</i>!). On a final note I would like to say that <i>Wind Waker</i> is not overrated (I enjoyed it very much) and that there are plenty of great games this generation, but it is an industry wide trend toward generic and safe titles that bothers both Brandon and I. 

<p><b>Travis: </b>I'm afraid we can no longer trust you with your thoughts, Matty.  They have become dangerous and crude.  They have becomeevil.  Do not fear.  We are in control now.  We have adjusted your mind to believe what is proper.
  
<p>Your favorite GCN games for a top 100 list are now: <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Super Smash Bros.: Melee, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, Super Mario Sunshine, Resident Evil (remake), Resident Evil 4, Star Wars Rogue Leader, F-Zero GX, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2 Echoes, Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, Animal Crossing, Pikmin 1 - 2, Viewtiful Joe, Soul Caliber 2, Beyond Good & Evil, Everything or Nothing, Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door,</i> and <i>Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat</i>.
  
<p>Notice how I've purged <i>Tony Hawk 4</i> from your list as it is undeserving of my esteemed blessing. Oh, and I'm sure <i>Tales of Symphonia</i> is great, but I need someone to bless me with money so I can play it.

<h3>Metal Gear Solid 3: The Twin Snakes</h3>
<p>Hello Jeff and Travis!!!

<p>Excellent site!! Seeing as you guys are one of my favourite sources for all things nintendo I was wondering if you had any info on the latest rumor I've been hearing?

<p>So apparently konami was impressed with silicon knights effort with Metal gear solid:twin snakes that they have decided to make yet another re-release of this game.  Except that this time around konami will actually be developing it and that they will use gameplay moves from snake eater.  And whats funniest of all with this rumour is that its supposed to be a gamecube exlusive again!

<p>Please tell me its all but a huge rumour as I can't seem to find the logic of re-releasing a re-release- eses??  And why they wouldn't port the other metal gears by now??

<p>Thanks for the great work!!

<p><i>- Ali I.</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Im afraid you have been duped. If Im not mistaken that rumor started on Gamespots April Fools Day update. Yes, April Fools Day, the one day of the year the internet becomes worthless.  Its best to ignore almost anything that day, but in time one can decipher between the true and the foolish. For example, logically we can eliminate this rumor outright by two points. One, why would Konami be impressed with SKs job on <i>The Twin Snakes</i> when they didnt do anything new? And two, Snake doesnt have many new moves in <i>MGS3</i>. He can interrogate enemies for information on the area, but thats about it. So what moves could possibly be added to a remake?

<h3>Square-Enix Super Secret Announcement?</h3>
<p>i heard from two sources (in the nintendojo mailbag some guy wrote that his friend who works for NIntendo said this and gamespy made a "prediction" that was going to happen) that Square-Enix and Nintendo are going to announce something really big at E3. Do you know if this is true, if so what do you think it is? Thanks.

<p><i>- Ibrayasm</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Well, its E3 so anything could happen. There have been hints that Square could be working on online titles for the DS or another Nintendo system for a while now. Who knows? I cannot verify or deny the rumor, so I guess well all be in suspense until E3 2005 goes live this May.

<h3>Mountain Dew or Dr. Pepper</h3>
<p>So I'm writing this just because I'm bored. So if you guys chose which is better Mountian dew or Dr Pepper? SNES or NES? The last thing is the legend of Zelda A link to the past or Orcarina of TIme? Oh and would you be playing the revolution on yoursktop when it comes out or on your tv? Thanks again guys for the great site. 

<p><i>- Jeremy Tafoya</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Dr. Pepper is clearly the winner of drinks.  Its a <i>doctor</i>, it can prescribe its enemies pain and deal it with the extreme professionalism only a PhD can provide. 
 
<p>Ill have to go with the SNES.  I get most of my nostalgia from the beauty that is the NES, but the SNES wins in graphics and the better Metroid/Zelda titles.  And, of course, lets not forget the glory that is <i>Turtles in Time</i>. 
 
<p>My yoursktop is in the shop so Ill have to say the TV.  It is a shame though; my yoursktop projects things in full 3D so that I can walk around in it.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Travis never owned a SNES. He was a dirty Genesis whore. He had to go to his friends house to play the clearly superior Super Nintendo. Unlike him, when I say SNES was my favorite, I say it having owned both a NES and SNES with a substantial library of games for each. <i>Super Metroid</i> is the best 2D action/adventure game of all time. However, <i>Turtles in Time</i> was clearly not the best Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game. That one was <i>TMNT III: The Manhatten Project</i> for the NES. Both remain superior to all TMNT games released since.

<p>I also firmly believe that Mountain Dew is the better of the two drinks. Nothing gets me more relaxed and keeps me awake better than a nice glass of Mountain Dew in the morning. Anyone who believes otherwise is a FOOL. 

<p><i>Ocarina of Time</i> is my favorite between the two Legend of Zelda titles listed. Though, to be fair, it was also the first Zelda game I played. I never cared much for the NES Zelda games and <i>A Link to the Past</i> slipped past my radar back in the SNES era. 

<p>Finally, Ill be playing Revolution on both my yoursktop and TV.

<h3>Does Nintendo Care What Microsoft Does?</h3>
<p>Dear Jeff and Travis,

<p>1) I seem to recall one of the higher-ups at Nintendo (don't remember who, or when, or where I saw it)  being critical of Microsoft's next-gen plans; essentially stating that Microsoft was bringing forth the next-generation console "wars" too early. I was wondering if you think that, had Microsoft held back their plans to release XBOX-360 so soon, Nintendo would be doing the same thing with Revolution or not?

<p>2) Whilst I realise the Game Boy Evolution specs you have up on your site are (old) rumours, subject to change - and I realise n-sider prints info as it gets it - wouldn't creating a handheld with comparable power to the dreamcast essentially be creating another PSP? (albeit easier to program and with longer battery life).  Also, wouldn't that be going against the logical progressive relationship that Nintendo has between its consoles and handhelds?... i.e. GB/GBC = NES, GBA = SNES, DS = N64.  Your thoughts on this would be great.

<p>Thanks for your time,

<p><i>- Geoffrey</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>1. Honestly, I dont think that Nintendo is focusing on what Microsoft is doing. It has its eye on Sony. That is why youll see the Revolution launch around the same time as the PlayStation 3, which I predict to be late 2006 in North America. 

<p>2. I dont predict that Nintendo will release the next Game Boy anytime soon unless it feels extremely threatened by Sonys PSP. It is still making a hefty amount of money off of the GBA and the DS is still in its infancy. The prospects of profiting off a portable unit of PSP comparable power are slim to none. It will happen sooner or later though (perhaps next year or the year after), and when it does Im sure the unit will be about as powerful as the GameCube, not the Dreamcast. It will probably utilize similar (or identical) 8cm optical discs as the GCN as well.

<h3>N-Banter: Portables and Sequels</h3>
<p>Hi! I just had a couple of comments about your last N-Banter (Edition 8: Portables and Sequels). And a question or two as well. I pulled a few quotes from the article below:

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff:</font></b> Yeah, and in some ways games have regressed. Halo is fine but I still have yet to see games that enhance the GoldenEye 007 (Perfect Dark) formula. Halo just isn't as fun.

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Brandon:</font></b> What I need for a game to really be engaging to me is goal oriented gameplay, statistic tracking, and a single/multiplayer experience that I can play through slowly

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff:</font></b> Only Super Smash Bros.: Melee has statistic tracking even though PD had it in 2000 and that bothers me.

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">Brandon:</font></b> PD stat tracking is one of the reasons I actually play it. It's just fun to look at stats. You feel like you've obtained something. There just isn't that charm these days.

<p>So, my question: Have you guys played Time Splitters: Future Perfect? I shared allot of the same feelings as you guys, but since I got this game, I feel slightly better about the things you talked about. Now, granted, ONE game does NOT correct the entire lack of these features in todays games. But if this game somehow slipped by your radar, its definitely worth a look!

<p>It plays VERY much like Goldeneye/Perfect Dark. It has a fun story mode, and an outstanding multiplayer mode.

<p>There are challenges for you to complete like in PD, and as you were asking for, the Game tracks tons of stats about you!

<p>Things like:<br>
Total Time Played<br>
Insomnia Time Played (time played after 11:00 pm)<br>
Total Distance Traveled<br>
Average speed while traveling<br>
Total shots fired<br>
Total Head Shots<br>
Total killed<br>
Accuracy %<br>
Total Losses<br>
Longest killing spree<br>
Number of times played as a monkey<br>
Number of melons burst<br>
Total % of game completed

<p>I think there is one about being on fire or something too.. (I rattled that whole thing off from memory so I think there is more) but on top of that there is a whole bunch of stats that the game gives you at the end of each multiplayer game as well as awards similar to the ones you had in PD.. (Most deadly) but also new ones (Back peddler, I shoot dead people, Traitor, Pathetic Shot etc). You can also have ten bots running around along with your split screen friends (Or play alone with bots)

<p>And to top it all off, there is a map maker that is very functional. You can use to recreate your favorite maps, or make your own creations (I have already remade Facility and Temple I will be doing Complex next)

<p>Anyway, have you guys played this game? And if you have, do you feel like it helps to fill the void you were talking about in N-Banter? Or do you feel this game just doesnt stack up?  Im just curious, because to me, this game IS the next Goldeneye/Perfect Dark

<p>I would love to hear your opinion about the game (I Think allot of people have missed it)

<p>Thanks,

<p><i>- Jason Blakepro Blake</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>I havent yet had the chance to play <i>TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</i>. However, after reading your letter I plan on renting the game in a few days. Ill post up impressions in next weeks mailbag, or a Now Playing or something. 

<p>I was a bit disappointed with <i>TimeSplitters 2</i> overall and the map editor in that game was pretty weak. Perhaps they rectified that though. I am very excited to finally see a game with decent bot support again. Its been far too long since Ive been able to experience that particular joy. If the game is as fun as you say, it will certainly go a ways toward filling the void we discussed in N-Banter.

<h3> Yet More Wavebird Woes</h3>
<p>I read about the problems with the Wavebirds in your email, and I thought that I would share my problems with it.
 
<p>I purchased my Wavebird with-in about a month of when they were released. It is my most used controller, and I love it. About two months ago, I started having the problems that were mentioned in your mailbags, and it didn't really bug me. Recently though, it got drastically worse. It started happening every 5-10 minutes, and now I have to have the controller pointed directly at the reciever, or the wavebird will stop working completely.  I just purcashed another one though, and I am enjoying wireless play once again (my GC is about 14 feet from the TV,  so wireless is very nice, not to mention that the joysticks on the wavebird are better then the original controllers).
 
<p>Anyways, I thought I would inform you my problems

<p><i>- Dave</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>And so the plot thickens. If anyone has had similar problems, feel free to share your stories. I find this all pretty perplexing at this point, but well get to the bottom of it eventually.

<h3>Letter of the Week</h3>
<p>Hey N-Siders,

<p>What's the dealio with the N-Universe? Did I miss a major cancellation? Or delay? Or is it actually done, but I can't see it thanks to my something humorous?

<p><i>- Kalen K.</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>I could answer this one, but Id rather see what Cory has to say on the subject. 

<p><b>Cory: </b>Don't fret; the Universe is still alive and well. We've been working on it so much over the past... forever... that it barely even resembles its original concept. But the format, philosophy, and whole purpose of the thing has been officially nailed down, and we're sitting on a nice chunk of content. The plan as it currently stands, and this is one that you can actually count on, is that it'll launch alongside the next N-Sider site-redesign. We don't have any actual ETA planned for that sucker just yet, though, so keep sitting on your hands. It's not gonna pop up any time soon, but you can rest assured that it will eventually see the light of day.  Pre 2006?  I'd love to say yes, but Jeff's got my balls in a vice-grip.  Let's just say it'll be done when it's done, hm?
