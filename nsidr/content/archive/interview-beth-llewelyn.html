Nintendo of America was kind enough to give us some time with Beth Llewelyn, Senior Director of Public Relations for NOA yesterday afternoon.  We asked her a number of questions about what Nintendo showed, what they didn't show, and some of the concerns that have been on our and our readers' minds.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> We came in with a lot of expectations that we'd see a lot of titles that weren't in the show. For example, Eguchi was talking about <i>Wii Motor Sports</i> last year, a number of the Wii-branded titles we'd seen last year, and of course <i>Pikmin 3</i> that everyone's been asking for, and <i>Animal Crossing Wii</i> too. Are those still coming?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Beth Llewelyn, Senior Director of Public Relations, NOA:</span></b> There's obviously a lot of stuff in the works back at Nintendo that we chose not to focus on. You know, it's a very different show so we approached it differently. For one, it's very difficult timing in July, it's so far in the development cycle, so to take people off the games they're working on and create something specifically for E3, it's very hard to do that. So we made a strategic decision to show <i>Mario Galaxy</i>, <i>Wii Fit</i>, <i>Metroid</i>. We just really wanted to hone in on key titles.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> When can we expect to see more titles? TGS?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> It's kind of tough to say when right now, but rest assured you'll get your time with these games before they launch. In past E3s, it was a massive amount of games, and we just really took a different approach this year.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> We had a look at the press kit and there were a number that weren't shown anywhere here as well.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Yeah, that was our opportunity to show things and say, this is what's coming for the rest of the year, so it was a good opportunity there.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Yeah, <i>Endless Ocean</i> was one that a lot of people didn't think would make it over here, and stay in Japan... but a lot of people were circulating that screen shot around with the guy under the stingray.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Yeah. (<i>laughter</i>)<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> One specific question: There's a Zelda spin-off game featuring Tingle in Japan, and NOE announced it this fall for Europe, and we never thought it'd make it outside of Japan&mdash;it's an incredibly weird game, but we love it&mdash;any plans for that here?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Not on our list right now.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Is it going to fall into that <i>Mother 3</i> territory of never coming out?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> (<i>laughter</i>) You know, I don't know, it may end up on the list at one point, but things change.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Related to that, how does Nintendo of America decide what kind of titles to select for release here? It seems that sometimes a decision is made... "hey, this is suitable for Japan, this is suitable for North America".<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> You know, It really depends on the title&mdash;look at the lineup, look at what is coming out, look at how much work has to be done on a certain title in localization.  It's just balancing the portfolio, if there's something not coming out right now it's not to say it won't come out a few months down the road.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> When you announced <i>Wii Fit</i> this morning&mdash;a little while ago, Miyamoto had said he was working on a new intellectual property and had been for a long time... is this it, or is that still coming?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> (laughter) You know, it's hard to tell with Miyamoto, he's always working on something so this could be it, or it could be something else.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Still on Wii Fit, what is the board powered with? Batteries? USB? Pikmin?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> They haven't finalized it just yet, but right now it's batteries.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Is the Wii Remote used at the same time? Is the board recognized as a player spot?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> It's a one player experience, but the pad isn't read as a "player" position.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> On to the new IPs now: is Nintendo working on new IPs that could be considered for the core gamer?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> What, aren't Metroid, Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart.. Smash Brothers.. enough for you?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> I think we're talking about new and original IPs, and newer ones like Pikmin was for GameCube<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Yeah. We'll see.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Let's jump to Virtual Console games&mdash;they are relatively inexpensive, but a lot of our readers think they're pretty high priced amongst the "downloadable content" world of XBLA and PlayStation Network. Geometry Wars is five bucks like an NES game, but it's a completely new game on Live Arcade. There's a number of titles for two dollars as well.  We've heard a lot of people say they feel they can't just go try things they haven't tried before... they stick to what they know. Any considerations for lowering prices?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Certainly not something we're talking about or focusing on right now, but down the road we'll have to see.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Is there any kind of rental system being considered?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> We've talked about it, but right now we're not focused on it.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> What about being able to bring a Virtual Console game to someone's house, for multiplayer games? Any mechanism for people to take it to other Wiis?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> I don't know the answer to that.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> External storage.  It's been said that's something you've said you're "absolutely not doing," but really now, is that something you're "absolutely not doing" or is that changing?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Uh, well, again that's not something we're focused on right now.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> As far as today's press conference goes, what was the motivation behind all the YouTube videos, the community aspects of it all? And where was N-Sider in it?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> (<i>laughter</i>) Maybe you didn't give us permission?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> No one asked us!<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> You were probably in the mix, and there's so much out there right now about Nintendo, user content, it was a fun and different approach to how we presented ourselves.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> A lot of people are asking, when will Wii Montage come out?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> (<i>laughter</i>) It was just a fun thing to do, and there's so much out there we're sure no one's seen it all.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> A few months ago there was a little bit of a marketing shake up&mdash;moving it to Silicon Valley and New York... You were also one of the ones rumored to be leaving, so what's going on there?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Yes, we are moving our teams to San Francisco and New York&mdash;we're not talking about what individuals, the focus is E3.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> What about Nintendo Power We've heard that was being outsourced?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Yeah there's some changes going on internally there, but the magazine will continue to be published.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Can you say what the idea was behind the move was?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> It all has to do with being in the important markets in the country. Seattle is a technological powerhouse, so is Silicon Valley. New York being the media capital, we needed a presence there, so we're kind of thinking long term for Nintendo and branching out.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Are there more Nintendo World stores planned?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Not that I've heard, it's been doing well, but no plans at this point.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> What's your favorite moment over the years from Nintendo that you could share?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> There're so many&mdash;many E3 press conferences, certainly last year was a highlight from showing Wii. I remember showing the trailer for <i>Wind Waker</i>, and then </i>Twilight Princess</i>&mdash;and no one thought our next version of Zelda would be realistic, so that's something we'd never forget.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> One more question to ask: What's the company structure like at NOA? Do certain development teams have priority over others, and what about marketing and others?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> NOA isn't much different than any other companies,  you have your executive division, but the rest of them are equal — no one has any more pull than anyone else. And that's true for any other company. All the teams focus on entirely different things, and when development finishes a game, they go to marketing and it everyone gets their time.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Moving on to the games, what about that Mario Kart wheel? What's the purpose behind that?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> It's similar to the Zapper, just a more comfortable way to play the game.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> It's just a piece of plastic the remote snaps in?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Yeah.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Will there be an alternate control method for the game, so you don't have to control it in the same way you would in <i>Excite Truck</i>?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> You know, we haven't gone through specifics yet, we just showed it today and it's certainly something we'll look at in the future.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Did we spot some DS tracks in that video?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> There are new tracks, not all new tracks, but there are definitely new tracks.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Moving on to Smash Brothers: there's a couple features about the game that we'd heard about early on&mdash;specifically the orchestrated score, but all the audio released on the Dojo website thus far has not been orchestrated. And the other feature, is that it'd be online at one point; it looks to us like it won't be, but no one's said anything concrete about that yet.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> We're not talking about that yet. Just stay tuned on the website.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Other than Dr. Wright, are there any more characters you can tell us about?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Well yeah, there are four... (<i>laughter</i>) Just kidding.  Not talking about it yet, keep checking the Dojo.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Reggie mentioned the Zapper would come with software, maybe Duck Hunt?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Uh, not confirming any specific title, so we're still working out all the details, but at the 19.99 price point it'll be worth it.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> So maybe like a Wii Play type of software?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> No specifics that I can talk about, it's a little early to talk about.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> The Wii Fit mat, does it come bundled with the game?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> Not talking about that, we wanted to introduce it today and that's what we did.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Any other games planned for the mat?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> It certainly lends itself to future games, but we're not talking about anything right now. I'm sure you'll see more down the road.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> If hypothetically there was a Wii Sports 2, what games would you personally like to see in it?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> I love bowling. You're asking the wrong person, I'm totally not an athlete.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> You're just trying to think of the ones that are in it so you don't say them, aren't you?<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> (<i>laughter</i>)<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #0052A3">N-Sider:</span></b> Okay, that was kind of a non-question. I believe that's all we've got, so thank you very much.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #4A9E00">Llewelyn:</span></b> You're welcome.<br />
<br />
We'd like to thank our friends at Golin/Harris and Nintendo of America for the interview, and keep checking back for more of our E3 coverage throughout the week.
