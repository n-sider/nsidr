Majesco has announced their subtitle for the previously-announced <i>Cooking Mama 2</i> for Nintendo DS; the complete title is <i>Cooking Mama 2: Dinner With Friends</i>.<br />
<br />
Along with the title, we've got a few new details about the title.  150 cooking minigames will make an appearance alongside 80 new recipes ranging from shark fin soup to apple pie.  Perhaps most interesting is how your performance is ranked, though: an Iron Chef-like panel of nine dinner friends will taste and judge your meals.  Multiplayer makes an appearance with the Challenge Mode, which works with single-card DS Download Play, and players can customize their kitchen and Mama herself in Decoration Mode.<br />
<br />
Majesco promises to tell us more about the Wii version in due time.  They're also presently mum on the release date, but we're sure to hear about this soon as well, with Europe releasing the title in early '08.
