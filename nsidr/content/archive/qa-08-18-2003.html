<hr><h3>"Surprising and unique"</h3>
<p>
<b>
Hey Planetgamecube...just kidding (what a goofball)
<br>         Well it's been quite the busy week in the Nintendo camp.  Nice to hear that Wario Ware's making an appearance on 

the cube; very cool to hear that the Nintendo Club deal will come into effect here in America; and would you look at Namco 

showing Nintendo mad love this generation with DK on their plate. Those are all nifty little announcements; however, what's 

really tickling many-a-fancy here is this "surprising and unique" new product to be unveiled next spring.  I'm sure 

everyone's going crazy with speculation....is it a handheld? a console? if it's a console what's so surprising and unique 

about it? is it a hybrid?  One thing's for sure, when announcements like this are made, people begin salivating over what 

they hope will be the second coming of Nintendo--a spectacular system with mass-market appeal as well as an edgy "N5" image.  

Nevertheless everything is entirely speculation at this point and the last thing I like to do is get my hopes up for some 

high and mighty Nintendo renaissance when next Spring they end up announcing a Gamecube version of Gyromite that has neat GBA 

connectivity features. This is the part in my email where I actually ask a question.  I'd like to know what YOUR guesses and 

opinions might be on this matter.  Thanks and keep up the great work as always!

<p><b>Josh:</b> Good question, Michael. I do think that the announcement will concern Nintendo's console and/or handheld 

following the GameCube and/or GBA. The interesting part, obviously, is how these products will be surprising and unique. Some 

kind of innovative new way to play games on the console, such as a 3D display? A Virtual Boy 2, retaining the ideas behind 

the original Virtual Boy, only making them actually playable and successful this time around? These are admittedly 

far-fetched and likely not at all representative of the actual ideas, but this just goes to show that the concepts could be 

anything. Unfortunately, we've not heard anything even hinting as to what the ideas will be, so rampant speculation like this 

is just going to have to continue for a while.



<hr><h3>Dead Phoenix, TGS, etc.</h3>
<p>

Hi! Great site, i would like to ask you some questions;<br>
1-Is it true that Dead Phoenix was cancelled?what about the rumor about the game changing to Kid Icarus?<br>
2-TGS is coming and i would like to know if you have any insight about the 2 new Sega games.Also does MGS:TS going to be 

showed with a new build?<br>
3-Speaking of MGS, any news about the 2nd Silicon Knights game?Ign is saying that Too Human will be a launch title on GC2, 

can you confirm anything regarding this?<br>
4-Geist, what about this one, when is this game coming out?also is it true that n-space was bought by Nintendo?<br>
5-Zoonami, i've read that their about to reveal their game to the world, is this true???<br>
 
Thanks for the attention.
regards,

<p><b>Josh:</b> 1.) Yes, the game has been cancelled. Is it now Kid Icarus? It's possible...but for now, it's also doubtful. 
<br>2.) Sorry, I've got nothing concerning any new Sega products. MGS:TS will likely not be shown.
<br>3.) The next Silicon Knights GCN title is anyone's guess, but I do know three things: Silicon Knights <i>does</i> have 

one more GCN game coming, this game is <i>not</i> Thornado (it was cancelled a long time ago, regardless of what anyone is 

saying now), and it is also probably not Too Human, which is <i>very</i> likely being developed for the launch of the GCN 

successor.
<br>4.) Don't expect Geist for a while -- I'm going to say late Q3 or Q4 of 2004. N-Space has not been bought by Nintendo; 

the two are merely collaborating on Geist. 
<br>5.) Game Zero is progressing, that's for sure. Keep your eyes peeled.


<hr><h3>Graphics goodness</h3>
<p>
<b>
we can probably assume that xbox2 and ps3 will be around the 300 dollar range.  So  why doesn't Nintendo use all of that 300 

on graphics goodness  instead of that other non gaming junk that microsoft and sony will use??  :-)

<p><b>Josh:</b> Assuming Nintendo's console is cheaper to produce, the company would probably want to leverage that low-cost 

production to price the GameCube 2 lower than the competition's machines. This would give them a much greater advantage 

market-wise than having an extra couple thousand polygons on the screen.


<hr>
<h3>Nintendo and Microsoft?</h3>
<p>


<b>
Please tell me that nintendo's next announcement isn't that  they are working with microsoft  :-)  This is far fetched, 

right???    I hope :-)

<i>-Maxzzzzzz</i>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Don't let messageboard rumours fool you -- Nintendo and Microsoft will not be partnering anytime soon. They 

are each hard at work on their own respective consoles. <hr>
