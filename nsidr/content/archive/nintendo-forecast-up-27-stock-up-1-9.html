<p>The Mainichi Daily News reports this morning that Nintendo <a href="http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/business/news/20060404p2g00m0bu039000c.html">has raised its net profit forecast</a> by almost 27% for the fiscal year ending in March, following brisk sales of the Nintendo DS and foreign-exchange gains on a weaker yen.</p>

<p>The news drove Nintendo stocks up 330 points, or about 1.9%, on the Osaka exchange.  The gains come as <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=1802738">the Nikkei went flat</a> on profit-taking and bargain-hunting.</p>
