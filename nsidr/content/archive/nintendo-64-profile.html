  <p>In the mid-1990s, Marc Andreessen co-created Mosaic, the first easy-to-use Web browser.  In April 1994, at the age of 23, he moved to Northern California where he co-founded Netscape Communications Corp. Eight months later, the Netscape Navigator Web browser premiered. The following is from an interview published in the San Francisco Chronicle on December 7, 2003, recalling the events that led up to the creation of Netscape.</p>
  
  <i>
  <p>"After I got out here, the original business plan that Jim Clark (the former chairman of Silicon Graphics) and I worked on was for interactive television.</p>
  
  <p>We were going to make software for interactive TV, and we said, "OK, great. Which interactive TV platforms will it run on?" And we couldn't come up with any, because there weren't any. Then we said, "OK, so how widely proliferated are those going to be in three years?" And we said, "They're not."</p> 
  
  <p>Nintendo was about to come out with Nintendo 64, and we said, "Let's do an online gaming service with Nintendo 64, because that's going to be a volume platform."</p>
  
  <p>We almost did that, except that Nintendo 64 was supposed to ship at the end of 1995, and we were starting in early 1994, and figured that was too long to wait. <b>If they had shipped a year earlier, we probably would have done that instead of Netscape.</b></p>
  
  <p>We were starting to get really depressed because none of our ideas were working."</p>

  <p>Nintendo 64 is the result of a collabration between Nintendo and Silicon Graphics. (Note: Silicon Graphics were responsible for the frighteningly lifelike dinosaurs in Jurassic Park.) Nintendo and SGI teamed-up to literally shrink a $10,000 workstation into a $250 video game system. The result of this is Nintendo 64, the world's first true 64-bit home video game system.</p>
  
  <p>Two 64-bit processors, a custom 64-bit MIPS RISC central processor and the 64-bit Reality Immersion graphics processing unit, provide a power and speed for incredible gameplay with an unmatched list of features for its day: tri-linear MIP map interpolation, anti-aliasing, unparalleled memory speed, real-time 3-D, Z-buffering, mediarisc architecture, wavetable synthesis sound, and a 32-bit color palette.</p>

Ice Blue proved to be the most popular color.  Atomic Purple was also sold in a bundle with an extra controller while Jungle Green was bundled with <i>Donkey Kong 64</i> and the RAM pak.</p>

<p>The story begins on Monday, August 23, 1993, when Nintendo announced a magical partnership with Silicon Graphics (SGI) to create a 3D, 64-bit Nintendo gaming console, codenamed "Project Reality".  The news instantly knocked the share price of 3DO - creator of the 32-bit 3DO console - down by $4.50.</p> 

<p>A technical presentation called "drive flight simulator" was used to show the capabilities of the Silicon Graphics graphic workstation.</p> 

<p><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/database-n64gi-042404silicon01.jpeg" border="1">
<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/database-n64gi-042404silicon02.jpeg" border="1"></center></p>

<p>The presentation expressed a vast 3D town that could be freely traversed. Nintendo characters including Mario stood on the rows of houses.  With the 3D prowess of the Silicon Graphics machine, Nintendo suddenly realized it no longer had a use for its <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/snes-cd-profile">Super Famicom CD</a> hardware.  With that new-found knowledge, Nintendo pursued the development of the new Silicon Graphics hardware.</p>

<p>According to the agreement, Silicon Graphics would collaborate with Nintendo to develop the console and Nintendo would license it. Nintendo and SGI touted the machine as one which would <i>run faster, show more colors, look smoother, and play more realistically than any system made before it</i>. The initial goal was to create a piece of hardware that could be priced under $249 and would launch in late 1995. According to vice president of Nintendo of America, Howard Lincoln, "Our work with SGI enables us to actually skip a generation by diving straight through to 64-bit, 3D video entertainment."</p> 

<p>Competing systems from both Sony and Sega were to be 32-bit (3DO and Atari made short appearances, but quickly bailed on the extremely competitive console industry).  Three months after Nintendo announced the Nintendo 64, Sony announced its Sony PlayStation of which it predicted would retail for $499.</p>

<h3>"Dream" Team</h3>

<p>The infamous "Dream Team" was created around this time.  The Dream Team was a group of American and European companies pushed by Nintendo of America who signed on to develop games and/or provide technologies exclusively for use with Nintendo 64. All Dream Team partners agreed to one-year exclusivity for one game under development. In exchange for an exclusive title, Dream Team partners received early access to the development kits and early development help from Nintendo and Silicon Graphics.</p>

<p>On March 30, 1994, Rare Ltd. and Williams announced themselves to be the first "Dream Team" software partners for Project Reality.  As part of the deal, Rare was to develop arcade-like games (ex. Killer Instinct) and Williams was to market them under the Midway name. Nintendo touted Project Reality's power to be equivalent to that of arcade machines.  DMA Designs Ltd. (known for Lemmings) was the next to join the "Dream Team" in May of 1994.</p>

<p><blockquote><p><hr></p>

<font size="4">"...many were not ready for the costs of arduous Nintendo 64 development cycles on top of a risky cartridge format..."</font> 

<p><hr></p></blockquote></p>

<p>The majority of the companies were alleged PC experienced, who were hoping to truly be the forefront of 3D technologies. Unfortunately many were not ready for the costs of arduous Nintendo 64 development cycles on top of a risky cartridge format. Little by little, half of the companies returned to PC development or just went bankrupt.</p>

<p>In addition to the "Dream Team", there were also several Japanese companies supporting Nintendo including Konami, Imagineer, SETA, Kemco, and Hudson Soft.</p>

<p><h3>The Ultra 64</h3></p>

<p>On May 5, 1994, Nintendo gave the "Ultra 64" its name and revealed it would use standard cartridges that could hold up to 100 megabits.  The Ultra 64 would use cartridges, rather than the CDs that were being used in competitor's 32-bit consoles. The main competitors of the Ultra 64 would be Sony's PlayStation and Sega's Saturn.</p>

<p>The cartridge format had many advantages over the other CD-ROM-based consoles. For example, there is a huge difference in loading times between a CD and a cartridge, with the cartridge having the major advantage. There were drawbacks however, as cartridges are costly and also cannot give the same "CD-quality" sound.</p>

<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/database-n64gi110103ultra64logo.jpg" width="112" height="110"></center>

<P><center><a HREF="https://static.nsidr.com/media/database-n64gi110103ultra64big.jpg"><img SRC="https://static.nsidr.com/media/database-n64gi110103ultra64small.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="220" BORDER=0></a></center>

<p>Nintendo refused to use CDs, claiming the CD-ROM drives were still too expensive. Also, many of Nintendo's influential designers such as Shigeru Miyamoto, expressed that extended load times, which are inherant in all disc-based games, was something Nintendo wished to avoid in its software.  Finally, there was the issue of piracy with CDs (this would prove to be a huge problem for Sony's PlayStation, with estimated losses being in the hundred of millions of dollars).</p>

<p>These excuses, however, didn't cut it for third-party game developers.  In 1994, CD-ROM technology, although still pricey, had already begun to catch on and was predicted to drastically decrease in price in just a few years. (Including a CD-ROM drive in the Nintendo 64 at launch may have raised its price by almost $99.)  Moreover, to avoid load times in games, Nintendo could have simply added more RAM to the console to speed up the memory access times.  (However, this again, would raise the price of the console.)</p>  

<p>Instead, to many developers' dismay, Nintendo - thinking rationally and perhaps stubbornly at the same time - gave the ideas of a non-cartridge format the cold shoulder.  Nintendo was afterall, thoroughly content with itself being the only supplier of game cartridges.</p>

<p>Third party developers, on the other hand, were wary about Nintendo's choices.  Many felt the jump from developing for 16-bit consoles to 32-bit was much smaller and easier than the tremendous leap from 16-bit to 64-bit.  On top of Nintendo's outrageous royalty costs - collected from every game developed for the system - third party developers also had to deal with the high production costs for cartridges.  The cost of producing cartridges totaled in dollars, while CDs cost only cents.</p>

<h3>Video Games Become 3D</h3>

<p>Then on June 23, 1994, during the Summer Consumer Electronics Show, Nintendo gave a behind closed-doors preview of Rare's <i>Killer Instinct</i> and Midway's <i>Cruis'n USA</i> to selected developers and press.  Also at the show, Acclaim announced <i>Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter</i> for the Ultra 64.</p>

<p>Howard Lincoln went on to say, "Game players will be able to play these same games with no compromise in graphics, sound, or gameplay next year at home when Ultra 64 is launched." What Nintendo forgot to tell everyone, was the fact that <i>Cruis'n USA</i> was running off Williams' arcade hardware and not the Ultra 64.  The Ultra 64 was scheduled to launch less than a year away and there were still no games, even in an early stage, running on the hardware.</p>

<p>On Monday, July 18, 1994, Nintendo announced the Ultra 64 would use Rambus, Inc.s 500 MHz memory technology to accommodate fluid three-dimensional graphics.  Also, the first licensee development kits shipped from Nintendo to third-parties.  A month later on October 5, Williams Entertainment announced it had begun development of DOOM for the Ultra 64.</p>

<p>On Monday, November 21, 1994, the night before Sega Saturn was scheduled to release in Japan, Nintendo hoped to steal some of Sega's spotlight by announcing Shigeru Miyamoto's involvement with Paradigm Entertainment to produce an Ultra 64 game called "Pilotwings". It was revealed the game would arrive at the Ultra 64's launch.</p>

<h3>Competition Heats Up</h3>

<p>For the Japanese launch, Sega's Saturn sold 200,000 units during the first day. Virtua Fighter is largely credited for the early success of the Saturn as the version of the game was a near perfect conversion of the arcade counterpart.</p>

<p>On Saturday, December 3, 1994, Sony Computer Entertainment released its PlayStation game console in Japan with an initial retail price of 370,000 yen (about $387). Games released at launch included Ridge Racer, King's Field and Crime Crackers. Within a month, Sony sold more than 300,000 units. Within six months, over one million units were sold.</p>

<p>On January 5, 1995, SGI announced it had completed the chipset for the Ultra 64.  It turned out to be nearly everything Nintendo had promised in the beginning. Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation were rumored to sell respectively for $299 each.  Many questioned how Nintendo, with its superior technology, could keep its $249 price tag.</p>

<h3>Nintendo Becomes Equated with "Delay"</h3>

<p>On May 5, 1995, Nintendo announced what everyone had already predicted - the Ultra 64 was delayed.  The console was tentatively delayed in Japan until December and wouldn't arrive in North America and Europe until April, 1996, at the earliest.  Nintendo blamed the lack of complete software for the delay.  It appeared Nintendo's "Dream Team" was turning out to be just that, a dream.  Sega and Sony had handfulls of publishers working on their consoles, while Nintendo had less than ten.  This month, Sony's PlayStation had already sold over 1 million units worldwide.</p>

<p>Nintendo's delay announcement happened but six days prior to the 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo.  This gave Sony and Sega a great opportunity to encourage the press to focus their attention on the Saturn and PlayStation. On May 10, 1995, Sony announced the American release of the Sony PlayStation for September 9, 1995, at a price of $299. On May 11, Sega blew everyone out of the water by announcing that the Saturn had arrived in North American stores the day before. 

<p>Suddenly, everyone was wondering where Nintendo's steam went? Nintendo's heat had all but turned to ice.

<p>There was not all bad news, however, as it was officially announced that the public would get its first real look at the Ultra 64 at the 1995 Spaceworld Exhibition (Shoshinkai).  In addition, Nintendo eased the bad news by signing up new studios to make games for the Ultra 64.  These included big names such as LucasArts (Star Wars games) and Electronic Arts (Madden and other sports games).  News of the Ultra 64's "new revolutionary controller" also surfaced.</p>

<p>It wasn't until November 24, 1995, when Nintendo Co., Ltd., officially unveiled the Nintendo Ultra 64 at the 7th Annual Shoshinkai Software Exhibition. At this show, the Ultra 64 was given its final name - dubbed the <b>Nintendo 64</b>. (The name change from Ultra to Nintendo 64 was a result of Ultra 64 already being trademarked.)  Nintendo also announced a tentative launch date of April 21, 1996 in Japan at a suggested retail price of 25,000 yen (~$250).  North American and European releases were scheduled for the same time frame.  Attendees questioned the company's ability to deliver adequate consoles and games to all three regions.</p>

<p>Worries about the quality of the games quickly tapered when attendees got their hands on Super Mario 64 and the new controller.  Everyone was absolutely thrilled with Miyamoto's latest creation, calling it the "best game of all time".  The controller, with its joystick, was also a crowd favorite.</p>

<p>The number of software on display and announced to be in development consisted of thirteen titles.  These included Super Mario 64, Wave Racer 64, Super Mario Kart R, and Star Fox 64. Other games simply announced but not playable nor in video form included Legend of Zelda 64, Pilot Wings 64, Kirby Ball 64, Body Harvest, Star Wars: Shadow of the Empire, and Buggy Boogie.  It was announced at the show that each title would feature an individual sale price of about 9,800 yen (around $100 US).</p>

<p>Only two of the 11 demos were playable (Mario and Star Wars) and both were less than 50 percent complete. With the console's release scheduled a few months away, many hoped to see the games closer to completion.  The timing was something to be questioned.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>On February 1, 1996, Nintendo delayed the North American release until September 30, 1996.  In March, the Japanese release got moved back to June 23. Nintendo said there were difficulties in manufacturing enough units for distribution for America, Europe, and Japan all at once. This delay would also give Nintendo enough time to finish some of the Nintendo 64 games.</p>
  
<p>Unfortunately, this also gave Sega and Sony more time to place their consoles into gamer's homes.  Sony's library of games - including Namco's <i>Tekken</i> - was growing each day and Sega released its killer app - <i>Virtua Fighter 2</i>. The incredible hype <i>Super Mario 64</i> was receiving, was about the only thing that kept Nintendo in people's thoughts.</p>

<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/database-n64gi110103n64console.jpg" width="400" height="270"></center>

<p>On June 23, 1996, despite a meager three-title selection (Super Mario 64, PilotWings 64, and Shogi Chess), Nintendo sold 300,000 Nintendo 64s in Japan.  This was equal to the combined first day sales for Saturn and PlayStation. <i>Super Mario 64</i> was sold in an almost one-to-one tie ratio with the N64 console. In a three month time frame, (June 23 - Septemeber 9) Nintendo announced Super Mario 64 had sold 1 million copies.</p>

<p>Nintendo was not finished doling out the good news and announced it would move up the North American release date to September 29, 1996.  In addition, Nintendo made the decision to sell the console for $199 rather than its original estimate of $249.</p>
   
<p>For the North American launch, Nintendo of America shipped 300,000 Nintendo 64s to retailers along with launch titles Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64 (at a one-to-one ratio with the hardware).  It took the PlayStation three months to sell the same amount.</p>

<p>In total, for the three months following and including launch, 1.6 million consoles were sold.  For reference, from September 9 to December 25, 1994, Sony's launch figures were about 527,000, while Sega's Saturn, from May 1995 -- when Sega surprised the industry with its sneak launch -- to Christmas 1995, sold about 400,000 units.</p>

<p>For the North American launch, Nintendo together with ad agency Leo Burnett, performed a three-part series of advertisements that cost as much as $100 per unit, or $50 million in total.</p>

<h3>Price Drama</h3>

<p>On February 21, 1997, Nintendo of Japan announced it would drop the price of the Japanese N64 to $137 on March 14. A week later on February 27, Sony announced it would immediately lower the price of the PlayStation to $200 in the United Kingdom and Australia. And again, a week later, on March 3, Sony Computer Entertainment of America announced it would lower the price of the PlayStation to $149.</p> 

<p>George Harrison of Nintendo of America said Sony's price drop didn't faze his company and that NOA had no plans to likewise drop the console's price. Three days later a Japanese newspaper quoted Hiroshi Yamauchi as saying that Nintendo would indeed lower the price of the N64 in North America by $50 by the end of March.</p>

<p>Nintendo of America said the statement by Yamauchi had been mistranslated and reaffirmed that it would not be lowering prices. Nintendo of America dropped the price of the N64 to $150 two weeks later. Sega lowered the price of the Saturn to $150 in June.</p>

<p>After Sega realized the Saturn was a failure in 1997, Sega of America alone cut 30 percent of its work force. Many conclude that it was Sega's last minute decision to make the console support 3-D that led to a very sparse launch line-up of games. Launching at only four select nationwide retailers enraged those businesses that got left out, including 2 ton beasts like Wal-Mart.  Along with its "surprise launch" that upset many retailers and outrageous price tag of $400, the fate of Sega's Saturn was only inevitable.</p>

<p>Sony, on the other hand, only continued to gain momentum.  As the years passed, more and more publishers signed on to develop for the cheaper and easier to develop PlayStation. By the end of 1997, only 45 games had been released for the Nintendo 64.  This compared to the over a hundred that were already available on the PlayStation.  This is when complaints that Nintendo's games were too child-oriented began surfacing.  The Sony PlayStation, with Tomb Raider's Lara Croft headlining the movement, was being seen as more edgy and appealing to adults.</p>

<p>Square's release of Final Fantasy VII was the first sign that the Nintendo 64 would have a long and hard struggle ahead of it. In 1997, Final Fantasy VII reached sales in Japan of over 3.5 million.  PlayStation sales were already exceeding 12 million worldwide. Namco, Konami, Capcom, Electronic Arts and nearly every other large American and Japanese publisher focused most or all of their development efforts on the PlayStation.  It was mainly Nintendo and Rare - with games such as Super Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Goldeneye 007, Mario Kart 64, and Banjo Kazooie - that kept the Nintendo 64 competitive.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Nintendo kept toe-to-toe with sales of the PlayStation.  In some months, the Nintendo 64 outsold the PlayStation (and Dreamcast).  The Saturn had passed away by early 1998 - primarily due to its fans, retailers, and developers being burned by the 32x and Sega CD.</p>

<p>In January 1998, Sony announced worldwide PlayStation software shipments of over 200 million and hardware sales of over 40 million.  Nintendo and Sony were putting up a good fight.  By September 1998, the battlefied looked as follows in North America:  The PlayStation had sold 14 million units.  The Nintendo 64 stood at 11 million units.</p>

<p>On September 9, 1999, Sega gave console manufacturing one last try by releasing the Dreamcast.  An estimated 546,000 Dreamcasts were sold during the week of September 11 versus 223,000 the week before.  Seven Dreamcast games made it into the top 20 sales that month.  For the month of September, retail pricing for the Dreamcast software averaged $49, while Nintendo 64 sold at $46 and Sony PlayStation was at $33.  Nintendo and Sony suffered only a small 8 percent drop in sales.  As you can expect, the Dreamcast did not last long.  Sega ran into financial problems and could not continue marketing the Dreamcast to an audience that wasn't interested.  The console was discontinued in February 2001.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the 32/64-bit generation, releases on the Nintendo 64 dried up.  Most developers had already begun to move to next-generation development.  Sony's announcement that the PlayStation 2 would be backwards compatible (able to play both PlayStation and PlayStation 2 software) allowed developers to continue making and releasing games for the PlayStation.  This only sealed the PlayStation's domination of sales during the transition period from the current generation to the next.</p>

<p>After all had been said and done, total worldwide sales of the Nintendo 64 reached 32,920,000.  Sony's PlayStation meanwhile, has exceeded worldwide sales of 100,000,000.  Much of this can be attributed to Sony's success in Europe and other areas of the world.  Nintendo's strict policies for retailers and publishers from the NES and SNES only came back to bite it in the butt.  Sony took advantage of Nintendo's mistakes and succeeded in nearly doubling the size of the video game industry.</p>

<p>The Nintendo 64 was Nintendo's first fully 3D producing video game system. The console and its accessories contain model numbers beginning with the letter NUS and ending with a consecutive number system.  NUS is said to represent "<b>N</b>intendo <b>U</b>ltra <b>S</b>ixty-Four".  The Nintendo 64 was tentatively dubbed "Ultra 64" before being officially named "Nintendo 64".  (In the early days of Nintendo, "Ultra" was used to describe <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=employees/gunpeiyokoi.htm">Gunpei Yokoi's</a> various inventions.)  In addition, the console was code-named "Project Reality" in its early stages of development.  Here you will find detailed information regarding all aspects of the Nintendo 64 and its accessories.
