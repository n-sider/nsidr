<br />
The Wii Laptop has its own built-in 16:9 7" LCD screen with its own sensor bar and has ports for connecting an external sensor bar and monitor as well as a single GameCube controller.  It does not appear to have a battery, but does have the power supply built-in as well as storage space for the power cord.<br />
<br />
Heckerdorn plans to run a multi-part How-To series on Engadget starting next Tuesday for those who'd like to build their own.
