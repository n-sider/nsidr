Yesterday, SouthPeak's <i>Ninjatown</i> hit the Nintendo Channel in demo form.  <i>Ninjatown</i> is a tower defense-style game based on <a href="http://www.shawnimals.com/">Shawnimals</a> stuffed ninjas.  Its unique sense of cute humor has made me smile on a number of occasions as I watched the PR run-up to its release next week, and the demo was no different.<br />
<br />
Sporting six levels which are likely the first from the game and thus have a tutorial flair to them and associated easiness, I nonetheless get the impression that this is going to be a quality game.  You'll get access to new types of units and powers on each level with which you'll be tasked with taking down waves of enemies that follow the road through town, using theme-appropriate ground fighters and units with air firepower.<br />

<div class="align_left"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3791-1.jpg" width="150" height="144" class="image_nostyle" /></div>I've personally not terribly familiar with the tower defense genre&#8212;few games out of that group have ever really interested me&#8212;but the <i>Ninjatown</i> demo was enjoyable.  The interface operates smoothly (a necessity when you need to make changes while ninjas are fighting), and it's hard to not smile at the cute ninja antics.  I don't know how deep the rabbit hole eventually goes, but the core design seems quite solid.<br />
<br />
Head on over to your Nintendo Channel (stick it back in your fridge if you need to) and get the <i>Ninjatown</i> demo.  It's about an hour of good fun, and if you find yourself wanting more, the game's available next week.  You can read up more on the game at <a href="http://www.ninjatown.com/">the official website</a>.
