<p>While half of the N-Sider LA crew was out walking around the Kodak Theater, we ran into the one and only Shigeru Miyamoto.  The N-Sider staff got the perfect photo op as Miyamoto relaxed outside a Starbucks with a couple of friends.  Below are pictures of Dean, Brandon, Jess, and Smith with the gaming god himself:</p>
