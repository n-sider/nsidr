<br />
<i>Chizu Saeki Formula: Dreaming of Beautiful Skin ~Dream Skincare~</i> aims to hitch a ride on the increasingly woman-oriented Nintendo DS bandwagon in Japan, branding with Japanese skin care tycoon Chizu Saeki much like <i>Brain Age</i> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1932">attached itself</a> to Dr. Ryuta Kawashima.  The software can create a personalized regimen for users seeking to have lovely skin for a certain occasion, and features videos of Saeki doing her skin care thing.<br />

The title will hit Japan on October 18.  Needless to say, it's unlikely it'll see the light of day in any other country.
