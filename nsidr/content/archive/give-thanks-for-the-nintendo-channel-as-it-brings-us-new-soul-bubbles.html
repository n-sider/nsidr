After this morning's <i>Wii Fit</i> (which, incidentally, is making me suspect my body wants desperately to hibernate for the winter), I browsed through the <i>Nintendo Channel</i> and found a real Thanksgiving treat waiting for me: a downloadable DS demo for my GOTY, <i>Soul Bubbles</i>.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_left"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3809-1.jpg" width="158" height="119" class="image_styled" /></div>The really sweet part, though, is that it's a <i>new level</i>.  I verified this with Mekensleep's Omar Cornut, who confirmed that it is indeed mostly original, though it does contain a few pieces of levels <i>Soul Bubbles</i> owners have likely already played... which explains the déjÃ  vu that sent me to confirm its newness.  It's not as wonderfully challenging as the later levels in the game; it's certainly more of a tutorial, but it's densely packed with the same joy that the game card itself has in spades.<br />
<br />
At this point I'd usually say "so, if you've had the slightest interest in <i>Soul Bubbles</i>, or even if you own the game and would like to play a new level, check it out"&#8212;but I think that instead I will just say this: if you have a Wii, and you have a DS, go.  Download, now.  Even if you have to clean the fridge to get the <i>Nintendo Channel</i> back on your system.  You do not want to miss out on this experience.
