<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/8stars.jpg" align="left"><b><a href="mailto:jason@n-sider.com">Jason Nuyens</a>: </b>I can remember when the N64 came out there were many times where we wanted to cart around the system to friends houses to play multiplayer.  After a while we thought it would be convenient to build ourselves a game box that we could play right out of (in the shape of a suit case) and then just close it to bring somewhere else.  While it was somewhat successful, it was bulky from all the wood and took hours to make.



<p>Enter the GamePak.  Its exterior looks just like a school bag, but its interior is custom designed to hold the GameCube just right.  It has enough room for two controllers in the main compartment and room for about one or two more on the front pouch.  Basically I found this to be a great hub for my GameCube storage, especially if I needed to go somewhere with it (which happens often).



<p>To test the bag, I took it on the road with me to a friends house.  The first thing I noticed was how well planned the bag was.  The space is used very efficiently, and makes for a rather small package once fully packed.  Next I checked the quality of construction.  This is where I found a couple points to pick on.  First, the memory card holders were a great idea, but are an extremely tight squeeze.  I realized after that one of the memory card pouches was not sewn on in a perfectly straight line which made it almost impossible to get my memory card out once it was in.  Now I avoid that particular memory card pouch like the plague (and keep it in the front pouch).  Another one of the areas I need to nit-pick about are the side pockets.  They are also a great idea, but were created in such a way that the flap doesnt close securely enough, leaving two holes near the top for any important items to fall out of.  And finally, the bag only holds eight games, which isnt a big deal for some, but for someone with a large library it can be a pain.  Cherry picking eight games out of my collection when going on the road is something I dont like to do.



<p>Where the bag faults, it makes up for in one area that is particularly important for Nintendo gamers:  GameBoy Advance storage.  Even though this pack was designed for the GameCube, it comes with many more pouches to hold other accessories.  I found it extremely convenient to carry my GameBoy Advance with its big brother.  As Nintendo gamers, we have to deal with a handheld as well as the console, so being able to carry it all together with no mess is a definite plus.  Equally impressive is the ventilation on the GameCube holder.  I was very careful in making sure that the holder was designed to leave the vents <i>completely</i> open so the system wouldn't overheat.  I can safely say that your cube would rest comfortably here.  The holes on the sides are exactly the right size to allow proper ventilation on both sides all while keeping your GameCube secure.  And finally, the strap that holds the GameCube down during transportation was an excellent move to ensure the safety of the unit.



<p>Aside from a couple of weak spots, the bag is definitely a friend to those who like taking their system on the road.  If you often take your GameCube to a friends house or take business trips, I cant think of a better way to transport your baby.  You carry it around like a knapsack and play the system right out of the bag once you arrive.  Personally, after coming from a situation with a wooden briefcase system-holder to this streamlined bag, I couldnt be happier.



<p><i>Note for availability</i>:  It will be available at Fry's Electronics and Outpost.com just prior to Thanksgiving.  It is expected in retailers some time in early 2003.  Go to <a href="http://www.lasraccessories.com">LASR Acessories</a> for more info in the new year.
