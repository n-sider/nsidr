On the heels of an announcement a handful of days ago that Vicious Cycle's Vicious Engine was approved for Microsoft's Xbox 360 Tools and Middleware Program, the company has announced today that the engine has joined Nintendo's Wii Third Party Tools program.<br />
<br />
Vicious Engine is a middleware solution for creating multiplatform games.  For Wii, the engine will support the Remote and Nunchuk; multiplatform features include AI development, platform conversion, and rendering "complex, dynamic scenery".<br />
<br />
Vicious Cycle also develops for Nintendo DS and Nintendo GameCube, and was behind 2002's <i>Robotech: Battlecry</i>.
