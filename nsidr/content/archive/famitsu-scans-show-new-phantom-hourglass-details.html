New scans of Famitsu's <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i> coverage, posted <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=161781">at NeoGAF</a> by neo2046, show a number of new game details we weren't previously aware of&mdash;showing quite a bit is crammed into that little DS card.<br />

Making their first appearance that we've seen are Rupee Likes from the <i>Four Swords</i> game for Game Boy Advance&mdash;creatures that, in that game, would lure you by looking like an ordinary Rupee, only to wrap you up and suck your wallet dry when you approached.  The ship that Link crosses the ocean in also appears to be customizable with a number of items, and Link can use said ship to go fishing or treasure-hunting&mdash;the latter vastly upgraded from <i>The Wind Waker</i> with an ocean's floor view.<br />
<br />
Also seen in these scans are a number of races making their first appearance in Phantom Hourglass media, including the lovable rock-masticating Gorons and a new race of eskimo reindeer penguins.  Favorite characters like "Sploosh" Salvatore and telescope guy Old Man Ho-Ho from Wind Waker look to also be making appearances.<br />

Phantom Hourglass hits Japanese shelves mere weeks from now, on June 23.  A release outside Japan is far more nebulous, with NOA only saying "holiday 2007" at the moment.  Those interested in the game would do well to check out our now-dated but rather-in-depth <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-zelda-phantom-hourglass">E3 preview</a> from last year's show.
