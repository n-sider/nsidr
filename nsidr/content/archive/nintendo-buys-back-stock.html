Nintendo said it would acquire 2.2 million shares of its stock Friday, according to GameSpot.com. The figure represents 1.55 percent of the 130.08 million shares currently outstanding. The company will purchase the shares next week and will pay 11,650 yen ($106) a share, totaling 25.63 billion yen ($233.5 million). Nintendo currently owns 11.59 million shares (8.9 + 1.55 percent) of its stock.  This recent purchase is speculated to ward off uninvited takeover bids.
