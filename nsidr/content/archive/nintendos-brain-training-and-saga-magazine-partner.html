Nintendo of Europe will be using <a href="http://www.saga.co.uk/">Saga</a> magazine to promote its upcoming Nintendo DS title Professor Kawashima's Brain Training.  The game is described as an exercise for the brain, with a goal of reducing the brain's age to 20 by means of daily training.  Saga magazine targets a more mature audience and has a readership of over 2 million people.</p>

<p>"I think it's one of the first things that happens when people become computer literate - they get the Solitaire game, and then no doubt they go on to greater things," editor Emma Soames told <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=14344">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.  "For people in this age group who get into computers, games are a major part of their online diet."</p>

<p>Although the game provides entertainment for an older demographic, Nintendo assures that the game can be played and enjoyed by everyone.</p>
