Take-Two Interactive has announced that it will bring <i>Major League Baseball 2K6</i> to the Nintendo GameCube in Spring '06.  This comes after the 2K series' two-year absense on the GameCube console.  Recall Sega pulled its 2K lineup from the system in February 2003 during its period of trying to regain profitability.  The series was then later sold to Take-Two in January 2005.  Take-Two also acquired and became the exclusive third-party holder of the Major Leauge Baseball Player's Association license (a deal of which, however, still allowed the console manufacturers including Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo to release licensed baseball titles).<br><br>

Take-Two released <i>Major League Baseball 2K5</i> for both PlayStation 2 and Xbox in March 2005.  A GameCube version was never released.  It's unknown the reason for the change of heart.<br><br>

Nintendo previously partnered with Exile Entertainment last year to produce <i>Pennant Chase Baseball</i>.  After missing its release date, the title was quietly cancelled.  Nintendo likely began development on it after acknowleding the lack of sports presence on its console.  With the announcement today from Take-Two, it may be that the company also recognizes an opportunity.
