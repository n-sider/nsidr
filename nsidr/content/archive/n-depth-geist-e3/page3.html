<p>n-Space's new action/shooter title <i>Geist</i> - formerly under development as "Fear" - was first shown publicly as part of Nintendo's upcoming holiday line-up at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The game was displayed in video form at Nintendo's media briefing and was also playable on the E3 show floor within Nintendo's booth.  It was announced at Nintendo's media briefing that n-Space and Nintendo would collaboratively develop the game.  <i>Geist</i> will be developed by n-Space with creative and technical input and publishing done by Nintendo.

<p>Geist is a hybrid title that combines the fast-paced action and perspective of a traditional first person shooter with stealth-based game play and a unique new mechanic: <i>the ability to 'possess' other characters in the game</i>.  This enthralling innovation is what will help the game stand above all the rest.

<p>Players will take the form of a geist - German for a ghost or spirit.  The geist will allow players to advance through the game by virtually entering the bodies of other characters and taking advantage of their physical and mental abilities.  



<p>As you progress in the game you will need to possess more than a dozen unique character types - using their weapons, equipment, skills, and even memories - to complete your objectives. Possessions range from soldiers with guns to dogs and even mice.  Animals are able to assist the player by performing specialized physical tasks.  The game will give players the chance to "choose different characters and see the world in different ways".

<p>The full story of the game has not yet been divulged, however this is what we know so far.



<p><center><hr><font size="2">In the hallways, labs and chambers of a shadowy compound, an unseen power is lurking.  As a ghostly Spectral Operative, players must search for a physical body, which is mysteriously being kept alive somewhere in the enormous complex. Travel through the human world virtually unseen, using your abilities to slip through cracks, interfere with electronics, move objects and more.  Face challenges from two unique angles-as a possessed human or a lurking spirit hunting its prey.  Players won't always be alone though-as they explore, they must collect the energies of indigenous spirits to help unravel a mystery and build their own power. Some will help ...but beware, for not all the spirits are friendly.  Prepare for a first-person adventure with a spectral twist!</font><hr></center>
