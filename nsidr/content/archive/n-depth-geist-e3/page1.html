<p>The announcement that n-Space would develop a first-person shooter exclusively for GameCube came as a surprise to just about every game journalist attending the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo.  The attendees approached the game with curiousity, not quite sure what to expect.  After playing it however, nearly everyone came away with a shining smile.  <i>Geist</i> is tentatively scheduled for a Holiday '03 release.



<p>Inside you'll find a complete analysis of the gameplay mechanics, story, and an in-depth look at the <i>Geist</i> E3 demo.  Use the link below to begin.
