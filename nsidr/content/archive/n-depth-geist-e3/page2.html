<p>Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Orlando, Florida, n-Space has developed a large portfolio of game titles in its lifetime for PC, Sony's PlayStation and PS2, and currently Nintendo's GameCube.  Before I delve into the "Geist Preview" sometimes its best to first take a look at the creator before one can fully appreciate the creation.



<p>n-Space has experience developing for GameCube in the past.  Although, it's probably not what you'd expect.  The company is the developer of <i>Mary-Kate and Ashley Sweet 16: Licensed to Drive</i> which released on GameCube November 20, 2002.  The rest of the company's offerings have been for Sony's PlayStation.  Here is a full software history of games previously developed by the company.

<li>Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes (2000) 

<li>Mary-Kate & Ashley: Magical Mystery Mall (2000) 

<li>Die Hard Trilogy 2 (2000) 

<li>Rugrats Studio Tour (2000) 

<li>Duke Nukem: Time To Kill (1998) 

<li>Rugrats: Search for Reptar (1998) 

<li>Bug Riders (1998) 

<li>Tigershark (1997)</font></ul>



<p>As you can see, n-Space has released several games a year since its inception.  For a company to do this, it must be skilled, determined, as well as contain a fair amount of employees.



<p>Some might scoff at this list of licensed games.  However, it would be unwise to judge the developer's talent solely on its choice of licenses.  You can't fault a start-up developer for wanting to build up a savings in order to have financial leverage to create original titles.  It's a wise business decision many overlook.  In fact, several of these games are million-selling titles which is an accomplishment in and of itself.  n-Space has worked hard to get where it is today and should be commended.
