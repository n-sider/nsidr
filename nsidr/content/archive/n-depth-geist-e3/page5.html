<h3>Multiplayer</h3>



<p>Its unfortunate we were not able to play multiplayer in the E3 <i>Geist</i> demo.  While available in the game, it wasnt playable at E3.  The reason for this is probably because it's still early in development.  Multiplayer was shown nevertheless in screenshots as well as the Nintendo media briefing video.

<p>The multiplayer in Geist will combine first-person combat with ghost possessions - where possessing a host gives you control of his weapons and abilities.  This will provide an entire new strategy to multiplayer first-person shooters.  The variety of game play modes, levels, and other options has not yet been announced.

<p>It's not known if cooperative play will be available in <i>Geist</i>.  The screen shot below is of two-player multi-play.  A key can be observed in the picture below.  The use of it is unknown - whether it's to be used by the particular human body to open a door or employed in a sort of "capture the flag" game mode.

<p>Many gamers would like to see LAN or online play, however nothing has been announced.  In addition, it is not known if n-Space plans on taking advantage of any GameCube + Game Boy Advance connectivity.



<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>



<p>Overall, I came away from the experience thoroughly impressed.  While only given a short 10-minute glimpse of whats to come, I cant help but be excited.  GameCube owners have been screaming for a good first-person shooter, one to compete with <i>Halo</i>.  <i>Geist</i> not only has the potential to be great but to also set a standard for innovation in future games.



<p>Its clear <i>Geist</i> is still early in development. Shadows could be seen on ceilings. The life meter and bullet meter displays appear generic in their implementation. Though they may be final, it was an observation by many.  If you shoot a wall, bullet holes disappeared immediately.  This is probably another indication of the game being early in development.



<p>Regardless, the graphics and visuals present in the demo are excellent.  The blur effect, while in the form of a geist, is unique and really helps to give the game personality.  The graphics are on par with other games on the GameCube.  In addition, no slow-down was seen in one-player.



<p>The game is expected to feature a variety of different locations. Much of the action is expected to take place indoors, however there have been screenshots which show outdoor environments. 



<p>The variety of ways to play the game is astounding.  I played through the demo over ten times at E3, and each time  whether I was in the form of a geist or human - I was able to do something or handle a situation differently.  In fact, while watching people play the demo, I noticed no one person played it the same.   I think that is testament to the fact that you can play a single level and enjoy it over and over.  Its refreshing and something I havent experienced in a game in quite some time.
