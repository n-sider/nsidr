<p>The NPD Group's numbers and analysis are behind  a recent AP story highlighting <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060115/BIZ04/601150350/1013">record numbers for the US video game industry</a> in 2005, led by portable systems like <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>.</p>

<p>Hardware, software, and accessories chalked up a record $10.5 billion in sales, over the previous  2002 record of $10.3 billion.  Stateside, the Game Boy Advance continues to be quite the killer.  NPD credits both the DS and Sony's PlayStation Portable are credited for introducing older gamers to the portable format.</p>

<p>NPD also notes, interestingly, that these numbers are made even more impressive since 2005 was also the year that supply shortages for Microsoft's Xbox 360 and a consumer "wait-and-see" attitude pending Sony's PlayStation 3 and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> console's releases in 2006.</p>
