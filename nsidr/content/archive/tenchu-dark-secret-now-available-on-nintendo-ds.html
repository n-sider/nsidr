<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-08-15-tenchudarksecret-nintendods.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="Tenchu Dark Secret now available on Nintendo DS"><a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1&product%5Fid=180161">Tenchu: Dark Secret</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> for $34.99.  The title, developed by From Software and published by Nintendo, is currently only available for sale at GameStop and EBGames retail stores.  More information on Tenchu can be found at its official <a href="http://www.tenchu.net/">website</a>.</p>

<p>Tenchu: Dark Secret provides players the opportunity to become ninja assassins. The game features over 40 single-player missions and the ability to construct your own weapons and items.  In fact, the game is compatible with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection allowing players to trade their items online.  Tenchu: Dark Secret currently has a 34 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/928588.asp">GameRankings.com</a> (based on two reviews).  Looks like the secret has been blown...</p>

"<i>Import Version:</i> I wouldn't touch this game for fifty cents. It lacks every aspect necessary for a quality game. The characters have no personality whatsoever. The missions are a joke; the ridiculously horrible AI makes beating every objective a five-minute walk in the park at best. Though the game sports a Wifi connection, it has been implemented so poorly that it serves as nothing more than useless add-on for a seemingly useless game. The terribly rendered graphics will make you squint down at your DS screens, and the sound will make you cringe in discomfort. Sorry, Tenchu fans, but this game isn't worth looking into, let alone the DS cart it's programmed onto."

"<i>Import Version:</i> Tenchu DS is nothing at all like the other Tenchus and should be avoided at all costs. Annoying sound, terrible graphics, and seriously lacking trap based gameplay make the title instantly forgettable."
