If you are an Australian Nintendo fan who has not been paying attention in recent months, you may not be aware of tonight's launch of The Nintendo Experience at EB Games in Swanston Street, Melbourne.<br />

The first one hundred customers to visit tonight will receive a Wii or Nintendo DS title and a lucky few will have the opportunity to snag a Wii or DS console as well.<br />
<br />
The Nintendo Experience is a dedicated "Nintendo Gaming Area" within the EB Games Swanston Street store and will be the first of its kind in Australia.
