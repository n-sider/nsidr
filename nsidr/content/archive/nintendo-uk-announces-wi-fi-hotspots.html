<p>Nintendo Europe has <a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/news/article.do?elementId=yjuIO0kBTDj_mPtvySk0L-S3uChP4656">announced that they have a deal</a> with BT Openzone and The Cloud to provide free Wi-Fi Connection play across the country.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi play will be available at McDonalds restaurants, Coffee Republic coffee houses, Hilton and Ramada Jarvis hotels, Road Chef and Welcome Break service stations, First Great Western railway stations, over 25 student unions and city centre BT Payphones and airports, football stadiums, the British Library, and Canary Wharf.  Additional hotspots can be located by postcode at <a href="http://www.thecloud.net/">www.thecloud.net</a> or <a href="http://www.btopenzone.com/">www.btopenzone.com</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, Nintendo will be installing even <i>more</i> BT Openzone hotspots inside video game retailers and other outlets across the UK, putting Nintendo of America's "people eat things besides Big Macs?" plan to utter shame.</p>

<p>As usual, Nintendo also said that unsupported hotspots could be transformed into gaming access points by using your Windows XP laptop and the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector, which will be sold November 25 for around GBP 30.</p>
