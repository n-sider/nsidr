<li>Custom Robo: The sport of tomorrow. In the not-too-distant future, competitors battle
customized robot warriors in holographic battle arenas. Victory is determined not only by
fighting skill but also by how well Robo Commanders design their robot gladiators, so
players need both brawn and brains to survive.
<li>Players explore a sci-fi landscape as they fight toward the Custom Robo
championship, powering up their Robos as they go. With tons of unique parts,
there are literally millions of possible Custom Robo combinations, giving players
complete control over how they fight their battles.
<li>Players can challenge their friends to one-on-one Robo battles anytime and
anywhere using either Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, Multi-Card Play or DS
Download Play.
<li>Players use the touch screen to customize every aspect of their Robo, including its
weaponry, and then polish it up after every battle to bring it back to top fighting
form.
