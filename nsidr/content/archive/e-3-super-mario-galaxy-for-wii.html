<p><ul>
<li>The ultimate Nintendo hero is taking the ultimate step - out into space. Join Mario as
he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in the
galaxy.
<li>Shake, tilt and point! Mario takes advantage of all the unique aspects of the Wii
Remote and Nunchuk controller, unleashing new moves as players shake the
controller and even point at and drag items with the pointer.
<li>Mario essentially defined the 3-D platforming genre with Super Mario 64, and
this game proves once again that he is king. Players perform mind-bending, lowgravity
jumps across wild alien terrain as they experience platforming for a new
generation.
<li>Game storyline: When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario
gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy.
<li>Characters: Mario, Peach and enemies new and old.
<li>How to progress through the game: Players run, jump and battle enemies as they
explore all the planets in the galaxy. Since this game makes full use of all the features of
the Wii Remote, players have to do all kinds of things to succeed: pressing buttons,
swinging the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk, and even pointing at and dragging things
with the pointer.
<li>Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Since he's in space, Mario can perform mindbending
jumps unlike anything he's done before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves
that are all based around tilting, pointing and shaking the Wii Remote.
