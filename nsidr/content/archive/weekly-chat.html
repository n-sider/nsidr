[N-Forums] Join us in the chat

Every Sunday, starting at 9 PM Eastern (click <a href="http://www.timeconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc">here</a> for time zone convertor -- convert from time zone US/Eastern to time zone ______), we will hold a chat on the IRC server irc.opa-ages.com in the #n-sider channel. The easiest way to access the chat is via our N-Forums Java chat room located <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/chat/">here</a>.
<br><br>If you would prefer using IRC and are unsure of how to navigate/acquire the program, start by downloading <a href="http://mirc.com/get.html">mIRC</a>, an IRC client. After downloading and installing mIRC, click <a href="irc://irc.opa-ages.com/n-sider">this link</a> and mIRC should start up. The browser you use may prompt you to launch the application after clicking the link. If so, press the "Launch Application" button if you are using Firefox. When mIRC prompts you with a "Link Request" window, click OK and you will be connected!
