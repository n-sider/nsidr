<p>Lionhead Studios' Peter Molyneux, of <cite>Populous</cite>, <cite>Black & White</cite>, and <cite>Fable</cite> fame, <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=19168">was asked</a> during his "Combat&mdash;Time to Evolve?" speech at the Leipzig Games Convention Developer Conference, how he thought his ideas might work with the Wii controller.</p>

<p>"If you wanted to make a big difference, where's the best place to make that difference?"  Molyneux answered.  "I think the controller is definitely it. There's no doubt in my mind that controllers are changing, and they're changing really fast.</p>

<p>"[I thought the concept of swinging a controller like a sword was] brilliant!" Molyneux continued.  "But then I realised, when I looked at myself in the mirror, I actually looked really stupid... Even with nothing in my hand, I get tired very, very quickly."</p>

<p>Molyneux recalled a story where a hardware manufacturer approached him during Black & White's development with a glove-shaped peripheral to see how it might improve the game.  He said the user became "greyer and more pale" every day the peripheral was used.</p>

<p>The message seemed to be that he felt developers should be cautious about the use of motion-sensing technology, and to not try to use it in the obvious ways without thinking of the consequences.  He concluded with words of praise for Nintendo's other unique control experiment, saying about the Nintendo DS, "I think the DS proves that. What I've found really fascinating is not using [the DS stylus] to scribble with, but using it in a very clever, innovational way."</p>
