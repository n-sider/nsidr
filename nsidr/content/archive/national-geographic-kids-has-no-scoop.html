<p>Like many of you, over the weekend I spotted an interesting tidbit over at Joystiq: apparently <i>National Geographic Kids</i> magazine had <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/01/07/magazine-reveals-revolution-details-zelda-super-smash-bros-d/"> a scoop on how Revolution would play</a> with a few of Nintendo's popular franchises.</p>

<p>Still, the whole thing seemed a bit odd to me; surely Nintendo would opt to release information like that through normal gaming news channels?  Vindicating this line of thought, Eurogamer, fast becoming the rumor debunker of record, has <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=62378">Nintendo's denial</a>.</p>

<p>"What [National Geographic Kids] has done is imagine how existing franchises would work with the Revolution controller, rather than actually seeing anything," Nintendo told Eurogamer.  "It's all still speculation."  And while speculation certainly is fun, it's worth mentioning that the Smash Bros. control scheme in particular set off a revulsion reflex in some of the series fans I talked to.</p>
