<p>Zelda creator <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> discussed his inspiration for the game in the book Game Over by David Sheff.  "When I was a child, I went hiking and found a lake," he remembers.  "It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it.  When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this."</p>

<p>Current Zelda producer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=6">Eiji Aonuma</a> knows exactly what it takes to re-create The Legend of Zelda atmosphere.  His <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/gamedev?gameid=m-Game-0000-1849">The Legend of Zelda: Evolution of a Franchise</a> speech at the 2004 Game Developers Conference discussed the magic required to manifest the Zelda aura into each game.</p>
