Via an inquisitive fellow at <a href="http://www.insertcredit.com/archives/001445.html" target="_blank">Insert Credit</a> comes the news that <i>SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters DS</i> is indeed headed to the United States.<br />
<br />
This comes as particularly satisfying news considering the relatively uncertain nature of the title, which was in development for some time.<br />

The title will hit in the first quarter of 2007 for an MSRP of $29.99.
