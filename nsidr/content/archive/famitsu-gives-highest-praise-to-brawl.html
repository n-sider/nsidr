In a move that drove thousands of die hard Nintendo fans to insanity, <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=1004&view=overview">delayed</a> again yesterday, as we noted&#8212;it will finally hit North American stores March 9, 2008. Japan gets it only a week later than originally planned, on January 31. Europeans are still left in the dark, sadly.<br />
<br />
Good news is not far off, however! <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-2-3127-1.jpg">Famitsu</a> has given to SSBB one of its rare perfect scores, a 40/40. The <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=9343520&postcount=180">reviewers</a> seem to especially enjoy the single-player mode, Subspace Emissary, and praise the high production values and polish of the game. So, fret not, you crazy Smash fans. The wait will not last forever!<br />
