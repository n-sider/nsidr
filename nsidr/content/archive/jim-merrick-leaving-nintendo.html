<p>Confirming <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/53FFAD0D-C2AF-4449-AB96-DE1CDB6C4499.htm">the story</a> originally appearing on Game Informer Online, Nintendo has told GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick</a> is <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/news.php?aid=13996">leaving Nintendo proper</a> to pursue opportunities elsewhere.</p>

<p>Just a month ago, Merrick was said to be <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1575"> returning to NOA</a> after his three-year stint in Europe as senior marketing director.  Most recently, Merrick has been giving most enlightening interviews on the recently-launched Wi-Fi Connection and the upcoming Revolution console.</p>

<p>NOE has still not announced Merrick's replacement since the original announcement he would be departing NOE a month ago.  We here at N-Sider wish him luck in his future endeavors.</p>
