<H3>N-Banter Edition I: A Dream Deferred</H3>

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b><I>Splinter Cell</I> is outselling 
  <I>Metroid Prime</I>. :-\ 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>How do you know? 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>The UBS Warburg sales charts. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>That is sad. It leads me to wonder 
  what the industry is coming to. Not that <I>Splinter Cell</I> is a bad game, 
  because it is definitely a great title. However, it shouldn't be selling as well as Prime. It is an virtually unknown license, whereas <i>Metroid Prime</i> is the prequel to one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I don't know...I just worry for Nintendo 
  in the U.S. What is left for them to do? They have released Mario, Metroid, 
  Star Fox, etc... 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>One of the problems is that Nintendo 
  doesn't know how to advertise games. Sure they made an awesome Metroid commercial, 
  but they need to flaunt its gameplay and the many high ratings it has received 
  from respected magazines and websites in follow up commercials. Something to 
  prove that it is for adults and the coolest thing around. Not just the one trailer 
  over and over. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>And another thing is that the <I>Metroid 
  Prime</I> commercial isn't even in as heavy of rotation as lets say <I>Star 
  Wars Bounty Hunter</I>. Speaking of Bounty Hunter, its TV commercial is much 
  more memorable than Metroid's (Prime is the better one for the movies though). 
  I mean, does Nintendo even flaunt or show its logo or anything in the <I>Metroid 
  Prime</I> commercial? Nope. They are still afraid of damaging their family friendly 
  image. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Heh. Honestly, I don't think that 
  the kiddy stuff sells as much anymore, or at least anywhere near sales for titles 
  aimed at older demographics. When was the last time you saw Blue's Clues or 
  Rugrats hitting number one? I have seen them sell well, but mind you that was 
  on the PSX and at the end of both the PSX and N64's lives. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Well that is, at least, partly because 
  many of us don't even buy games based on quality anymore. Just coolness factor. 
  Companies like EA make most of the games that are in the vein of Rugrats or 
  Blues Clues. Coincidently (or not) they are all complete garbage too. However, 
  Harry Potter is selling pretty well. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, but Harry Potter has a more 
  universal age appeal. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>That's true. It seems to me that 
  many are caught up in the image of <I>Grand Theft Auto</I> as being the best 
  gaming license ever. If the best selling game for the best selling console is 
  a violent game like that it can only make other games that aren't as violent 
  seem less cool. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, I've never played the game 
  before. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I have played <I>GTA: Vice City</I> 
  a little. It has pretty poor blood effects, but is just as (if not more) addicting 
  than Pokemon was to little kids...you never want to stop. It has excellent body 
  damage to cars, control, and everything. You can just beat up anyone, steal 
  any car, or not even break the law at all. It's weird but entertaining because 
  of the freedom it gives to players. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Cool, I will have to check it out 
  sometime. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Anyway, while it's true that Nintendo 
  isn't doing the best in the U.S., I think that even if <I>Metroid Prime</I> 
  becomes a moderate success along with <I>Resident Evil 0</I> then maybe many 
  will stop thinking of the GameCube as the odd man out. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I hope so, but I think Nintendo Japan 
  has too much influence. Just look at Zelda. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah, except Nintendo of Japan's 
  commercials are even better than the ones we get here. Nintendo needs to heavily 
  market the actual GameCube console itself with edgy commercials. Perhaps kind 
  of like some of the commercials we have seen for the PS2 in the past few months. 
  Consoles are sold on "coolness" factor more often than not these days. I saw 
  one GCN commercial the other day that was very "mature" content. It had a guy 
  lying in what looked to be a hospital bed. Some rather disturbing images of 
  bones, muscle, and organs were shown; suddenly the man sat up, sweat dripped 
  off his face and formed the GameCube logo in the air. It was definitely very 
  different from anything I have seen the Big N do before. I still don't know 
  whether it will just gross people out or actually prove to be successful. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, what was Nintendo 
  thinking...releasing the purple GameCube in North America? Even though I think 
  it looks second best out of the three (Silver, Purple, and Black). It certainly 
  isn't helping their image. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Exactly. I still wonder what would 
  lead them to make such a foolish choice. If they want to change their image 
  in the U.S. they should feature only Platinum GCNs in all advertisements and 
  phase purple out completely. They need a slogan too though. "Get N or Get Out", 
  "Play it Loud", "Get into it", and the world renowned "SEGA!" are all catchy 
  enough to stick in peoples heads. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I always expect something at the 
  end of the commercialsbut get nothing except a silent logo. I find it very 
  disappointing. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Exactly. Nintendo wasted the first 
  2-3 weeks of Metroid Prime commercials by having the majority of the spots be 
  only 20 seconds long. They were so short I find it hard to believe it would 
  entice many to buy the game. I realize they were building up, but if a gamer 
  sees one MP commercial it should not be assumed he or she would see the full 
  version three weeks later... 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Nintendo doesn't even use the slogan 
  "Born to Play" much with GBA either. There isn't even a sound or the cool animation 
  of the GCN logo during commercials. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I get a kick out of watching Japanese 
  GameCube commercials. They end with a hand grabbing the GameCube handle and 
  someone saying GameCubA. However, American's are afraid of the whole communism 
  thing...so I don't think that would go over too well here. ;) 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I personally think that Nintendo 
  should try using a few of those commercials for the U.S. They are very fresh 
  and not what people are used to. The "Shinobi's Back!" commercial is repeated 
  by my little brother and his friends all the time. I think that Nintendo just 
  isn't drawing enough attention. A Japanese commercial like the ones they use 
  in Japan in heavy rotation here would be pretty different. Americans love to 
  do Japanese accentsor is that just me? 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I think Nintendo of America is making 
  steps to change its image. Look how they didn't ask Acclaim to censor BMX XXX 
  whereas Sony did. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I think they realized that the game 
  was complete garbage before making that decision too. But yes, you are right. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Also, before the GameCube and GBA 
  released, Nintendo also made Mario Club no longer mandatory. I think that has 
  allowed more third parties to develop games...even if they are of lesser quality. 
  Then again, Superman 64 managed to pass under Mario Club's radar, so I wouldn't 
  exactly trust their reliability today. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Hmm. That is a good point. Getting 
  a bit off topic here I think that this was a particularly bad year for a futuristic 
  game like Metroid. America is pretty preoccupied with Dark Age themed entertainment. 
  Metroid Prime is far from that. (Aside from Star Wars, which is oblivious to 
  trends). 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, the whole Lord of the Rings 
  and such 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yup and it's the late half of the 
  year too. Just look at the top ten this week if you don't believe me. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>So does that mean you ride on horseback 
  in Vice City, heh. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>No, but Vice City is an 80s themed 
  game. Mortal Kombat is far from futuristic; Splinter Cell and Bond are modern 
  spy stuff. Metroid Prime is the only game that is very science fiction 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah. I wonder how well Britney's 
  Dance Beat is performing... 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Maybe it's not an issue but Science 
  fiction just hasn't seemed to be as big this year in entertainment as a whole. 
  If Star Trek Nemesis is bigger then Bond this year I will gladly admit I was 
  wrong 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b> I doubt that will happen. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>It won't. But about Britney's Dance 
  Beat, if there ever was a game to push the envelope on quality and creativity 
  of videogames to new heightsit's this one. lol 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Haha. I saw you drooling over those 
  polygons. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b><a href="http://www.xengamers.com/sections/news/9339/">Take 
  a look at this</a>. Do you know anything about the Korean gaming market? All 
  I've heard is that they pirate games a lot...but that's probably just a stereotype. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Actually, I heard a bit about it 
  earlier in the year when it was said that they were using the Matsushita GameQube 
  to pirate like mad. Wait. Maybe that was Hong Kong. It was somewhere in that 
  region. I would have to know more about the Korean Market to really say what 
  I just said. Which means that I just said what I thought I didn't think I thought 
  I should say. =O 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Heh, got ya. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Do you think that the Capcom big 
  five will help Nintendo a whole lot? 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I think it will help pave the way 
  for similar announcements from other companies. Will the five games be enough 
  to change the Nintendo of the past ten years? No. But, it's a start. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>How many starts is it going to take 
  though? 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I'm not sure; I think that this generation 
  was the start. The Company has changed drastically. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>The GameCube has been getting plenty 
  of mature and teen games this past year yet the image remains intact. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Nintendo still doesn't have a GTA 
  or a Halo. "Different minds now encompass Nintendo, from the shores of Japan 
  to the coast of Washington state." This is so true, in my opinion. Nintendo 
  isn't the same Nintendo we knew just five years ago. Just look at the patched 
  up Square relationship. Rare's departure. Namco and Nintendo getting along? 
  Who would've thought? 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Nintendo did have a GTA or a Halo... 
  in plentiful numbers. But since the start of the new systems those multimillion 
  selling franchises aren't selling as much as they used to. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>What's Nintendo's GTA or Halo? Nintendo 
  had Goldeneye last generation. I personally haven't seen a game on the GameCube 
  that has had a similar mass appeal. Metroid is the closest...but lacks multiplayer 
  to keep it fresh. Super Smash Bros. Melee is great...but most casual gamers 
  are frightened by the speed and chaos on the screenmy friends often complain 
  about it being too fast. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Oh, you are referring to strictly 
  adult titles. Then yes <I>Goldeneye</I>, but that didn't really even benefit 
  Nintendo in the long term. EA has gained everything from <I>Goldeneye</I> and 
  Nintendo nothing as far as I'm concerned. <I>Super Smash Bros. Melee</I> managed 
  to break a million in the U.S. without much advertising at all though. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah it's probably the closest to 
  a game that has mass appeal. Multiplayer was a huge part of the Nintendo 64 
  experience. With me, for some reason, it seems less so with the GCN, despite 
  having games such as <I>Super Monkey Ball</I>, <I>Time Splitters 2</I>, etc. 
  Perhaps Mario Kart is that missing piece...I don't really know. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Over 15 of the best-known characters 
  in gaming beating the crap out of each other yet not even that has enough appeal 
  to attract mass audience. That says something about attitudes in North America 
  if you ask me. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>SSBMelee doesn't have a single player 
  mode though. That's what it's lacking...overall it's not well rounded. However, 
  it's multiplayer is top notch. Now in <I>Metroid Prime</I>, we're missing the 
  multiplayer. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>To the casual gamer, yes it might 
  be missing it. However, a multiplayer mode would have ruined the intensity of 
  the game and hurt its reputation with longtime fans as far as I'm concerned. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I think it would have helped its 
  appeal. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I agree that it would have helped 
  its appeal. But it also would have meant another Metroid delay and hardcore 
  fans of the series would have had a fit. Nintendo is stuck between a rock and 
  a hard place with many of its franchises. They need to come up with something 
  totally new and appealing. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Then again, Vice City features only 
  a single player experienceand that sells incredibly well. Ah well, perhaps 
  we're simple making a judgement too early. Perhaps <I>Metroid Prime</I> only 
  needs time to sink in. 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah, it's only been out a month. 
  We should just sit tight for now and see how things play out. You never know, 
  moving into next year things could make a 180. 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, we'll just have to see.
