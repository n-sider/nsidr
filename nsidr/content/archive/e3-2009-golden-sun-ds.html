To call what passes for <i>Golden Sun DS</i> on the showfloor a demo would be a bit of a misnomer.  To be fair, much of it is rendered in real-time by the system, and you get the chance to walk a dude through a room or two.  But that's literally all there is to control.  The rest is just a series of fly-bys of various locations, and glimpses at some summon-heavy battle scenes.<br />
<br />
It's enough to draw some conclusions from, though.  The graphics seem pretty incredible, at least matching what's been seen in the likes of <i>Final Fantasy IV</i>.  Your dude actually looks like a sprite some of the time, but he's fully 3D and outlined.  The summons in the battle clips are especially impressive, featuring high-polygon models, cool direction, and... occasionally some bouncing breasts.  Thanks, Japan.<br />
<br />
The battles themselves are similar in style to what you've seen in the previous <i>Golden Sun</i> games, just using 3D models.  The characters are considerably less super-deformed while in battle, evoking memories of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>'s field/battle model differences.  The top screen during battle is awash with various aimlessly-floating Djinn, little monster dudes that form the basis for many of the mechanics in the <i>Golden Sun</i> series, but they didn't seem to serve any kind of purpose.<br />
<br />
So yes there's not really much to go on here, other than the notion that there is "more Golden Sun" and it is in "three of the dimensions."  There was a brief look at the jump-over-maze-of-floating-blocks style rooms featured prominently in the previous titles in the series, so it would seem that fans are indeed in for more of what they love.  Hopefully we'll know more soon!
