Bloomberg reporter Michael White reported yesterday on a phenomenon that has become commonplace in the industry: game makers <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=amWmy6_JG16U&refer=home">having to play catch-up</a> with Wii.<br />
<br />
Electronic Arts' own story is featured prominently, using their recent release <i>The Godfather: Blackhand Edition</i> as a case study.  Designer Nick Earl had to spend eight months&mdash;presumably the period between Wii's phenomenal reception at last year's E3 show and the beginning of this year&mdash;retooling the title for Wii.  Take-Two, famous for Rockstar and their Grand Theft Auto series, is also noted as a late arrival, having gone from no interest last year to three Wii titles planned for this year.<br />
<br />
White notes that game companies had expected Sony's PlayStation 3 to take the lead as did the PlayStation 2 before it, and GameCube's relatively poor showing was taken as an indication of where Nintendo would be headed&mdash;but Wii's showing at E3 changed their expectations.
