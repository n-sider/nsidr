<P><a href="http://www.the-magicbox.com/0510/game051030e.shtml"> The Magic Box</a> has some <i>sweet ass</i> shots of the new DS RPG <i>Archaic Sealed Heat</i> from the new Square branch-off company Mistwalker.</p>

<P>The graphics are apparently pre-rendered, and simulation RPG elements will exist in the title.</P>

<P>No release date yet for any part of the world, but it certainly has <i>this</i> writer salivating as though he has been presented with a dish of meaty treats.</P>
