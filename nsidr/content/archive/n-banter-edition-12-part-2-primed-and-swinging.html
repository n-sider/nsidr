<i>Column by <a href="staffview.php?staffid=10">Jeff Van Camp</a>, <a href="staffview.php?staffid=2">Cory Faller</a></i>

<p><b>Edition: 07-26-2005</b>

<p>Two minds...one column. Two motives...one goal. Two editors...one conversation. You have now entered a dimension unlike any other. This is N-Banter.

<p>In the second (albeit late) part of our first two part edition, Cory and I diverge entirely from the realm of Harvest Moon and viciously attack 3D iterations of our favorite series. Pokmon and Sonic each take light beatings, while the Metroid Prime series is ripped apart, piece by phazon infected piece.

<p><hr>

<p><i>(continued from part 1s climactic finale)<br>Jeffs pregnancy was later proven to be a hoax. Cory, having already purchased hundreds of dollars of baby supplies, was furious.  After the ensuing bloodbath, somehow the two resumed their previous conversation exactly where it had been interrupted...</i>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Every one of these Harvest Moon games takes tiny baby steps forward here and there, but sacrifices one or another element of the HM formula to do it. And it is a formula -- a formula that has yet to attain full potency.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>There's got to be a phenomenon to the gaming industry that I don't fully understand; one where if you're close to the development of a title, you can't see the obvious flaws and their obvious solutions.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Obvious flaws and obvious solutions don't always mean easy solutions. We can talk about solutions that seem easy to us because we are passive observers, but traveling to the other side of the fence could and would dispel that notion entirely. It's kind of like writing an essay. I can write it and edit it all day, but when you get a hold of it youre going to find tons of little things that I never caught. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>There are a lot of games like that, where they never fix their obvious problems -- problems that fans have a million ideas to fix. But the thing is, it never seems like the developers CARE. From all the dev diaries and interviews I've read, they never seem concerned. They always talk about completely different things, things regarding "oh we want to do this and that," but they're ALWAYS things that are just expanding upon or adding to current concepts. I've never really seen a developer legitimately try to fix core flaws in one of their games. They always seem to ignore them and add content in a million other places, but never address the problematic ones. I fear it may be based on sales or overall perception.

<p>Two prime examples: Pokmon and Sonic. Pokmon sells like water, so they just keep making it. They might actually be afraid of changing it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I'm sure they are.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Even if it's full of issues, their alteration might alienate their audience of people who don't notice/care about the issues. Sonic, I don't know what that's about. Sonic in 3D is inherently broken. How do they try to fix it? By giving Shadow the Hedgehog guns.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>No one knows how to make a good 3D Sonic game. Not Sega, not anyone. Perhaps you, but we don't design games.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I have had serious LONG entire-night conversations with people about how to make sonic in 3D. My ideas are far from perfect, but they're LEAGUES ahead of the bullshit that Sega is churning out now.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yes, yes. I was a part of those conversations...I've heard it all. On a side note, the Sonic Advance games were great. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Of course! Because they're still 2D! The sonic gameplay works FINE in 2D (more or less), but Sega didn't try to change it for 3D! They just kept it exactly the same!

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Mario needs a 3D overhaul as well. Mario, as a series, changed completely from 2D to 3D. Somewhat for the better, somewhat for the worse.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>But see, to go from 2D to 3D, a change is necessary. Otherwise, the change doesn't accomplish anything (Kirby) or is a disaster (Sonic).

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Kirby's are still side-scrollers.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Exactly! 3D didn't add anything to them. The change was unnecessary. All it did in <i>Kirby 64</i> was make the game 2-3 times SLOWER than older ones.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Polygonal side-scrollers always seem "looser" than sprite based games. Something always feels off about them.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>They do, definitely. That's exactly why I don't like what I've seen of the <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i> on the DS. There are games that have transitioned just fine, though (in terms of adding polygons to a side-scroller). Though the VAST majority of them fail horribly. Mega Man, for example.</p>

<br>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Mega Man. Talk about a franchise that lacks the ability to evolve.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>It evolved just fine. It's called <i>Viewtiful Joe</i>. But anyway I don't consider Kirby as having ever had a truly 3D iteration. So the Kirby gameplay has yet to be realistically altered to accommodate.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Ah! <i>Viewtiful Joe</i>. That was a great 3D side-scroller. Though enemies were often 2D. The best Kirby game is still <i>Kirby Super Star</i>. I haven't played <i>Canvas Curse</i> enough yet.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Donkey Kong...I don't know if I'd consider <i>DK64</i> a legitimate move to 3D, since <i>Jungle Beat</i> brought it back to 2D. I wouldn't be surprised that if Nintendo makes a DK in 3D again, they ignore <i>DK64</i>'s foundation.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b><i>DK64</i> doesn't exist, Cory. I never want to talk about it again.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Ha. Fair enough. So, 2D Nintendo games that have yet to be made 3D: DK, Kirby. Ones that have been successfully transitioned: Mario, Zelda.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Earthbound.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Earthbound doesn't need much of a change. That's the case for the vast majority of RPGs. The gameplay transcends dimensions most of the time, since the vast majority of RPGs are isometric.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>As little a change as Earthbound needs, Nintendo hasn't been able to do it. The Wars series is trying to go 3D this year.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Wars doesn't really count. It doesn't seem like a series going from 2D to 3D.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Sure it is. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>See

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Fire Emblem is moving to 3D as well.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>HOLD ON LET ME FREAKING TALK.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Fine fine.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Fire Emblem and Wars are two series that completely transcend dimension. If you'll notice, though it's 3D, the GCN Fire Emblem is identical to all the 2D ones. If they had done it properly, <i>Battalion Wars</i> would be the same. The thing about those games is that the very CORE of their gameplay is tied to playing the game like a game of chess: a plane-based playing field with strategic movement. No one talks about moving chess from 2D to 3D, because the whole idea is plane-based movement. <i>Battalion Wars</i> isn't a 3D interpretation of the Wars series in the least. Its a strategic war game with the Wars name on it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Okay, so doesn't that mean <i>Metroid Prime</i> is a first person shooter with the Metroid name on it?

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>No. It's not the same with Metroid. In <i>Metroid Prime</i>, the gameplay is (more or less) identical to the old Metroids: exploration, moving around freely, shooting. It's just a change of perspective, not a fundamental change of mental playing style.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I say that Mario Kart never made it to 3D unscathed solely because <i>Super Mario Kart</i> is still the most fun.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I don't really count Mario Kart as a game that can make the "transition," much in the same way that I never mentioned Star Fox. Despite how archaic their freshman outings may have been, they were originally designed around the "idea" of 3D movement. There's never been a 2D Mario Kart or Star Fox.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>What about <i>Excitebike 64</i>?

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Well that wasn't really a transition at all. The games had nothing to do with each other. <i>Excitebike</i> isn't a game that can really make the "transition." The NES game didn't have enough substance to transition to anything.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah. It was pretty awesome.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>If they were gonna make a 3D Excitebike, theyd have to pretty much throw away everything from the original. Excitebike doesn't really have a "core mechanic" that can be brought out of a game that simplistic and applied to another interpretation.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Sure it does. Angle your bike right and dont overheat.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I guess the core mechanics were temperature management and bike angling, but those aren't really "Excitebike is about this!" things. Those are just natural things to find in ANY bike game.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Here's what needs a 3D update: <i>Balloon Fight</i>. Here's what doesn't: <i>Kid Icarus</i>.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>God, I don't understand the obsession with wanting that game [<i>Kid Icarus</i>] remade. Was it REALLY that popular?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Only a few hardcore fans seem to even remember it enough to care. Others just want it because they've heard it was an old NES game. <i>Dig Dug</i> could be fun.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I don't know if I ever even played <i>Dig Dug</i>.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>You missed out. But anyway, let's list what hasn't made the transition thus far.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I can't think of any series that really BEGs for it. Sure, shit like <i>Kid Icarus</i>, but it's not that important.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Ice Climbers. Haha.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Agh, the only series that really seemed unfairly skipped over in terms of 3D was Metroid, and that was addressed.

<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">A Prime Digression</p>

<br>

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Brief tangent. Remind me to return to Kirby when I'm done. I'm sick of the Metroid Prime atmosphere. I'm sick of Phazon. I'm sick of that same goddamned synthesizer sample that they use in so many of the songs -- the one that sounds vaguely like a choral note. The whole thing is starting to feel generic. I want the next game to go back to an environment like Zebes.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>The worlds don't feel alive enough. I don't like a lot of industrial-like environments. I'd rather fight weird natural creatures than space pirates and dark infested creatures

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Zebes is still more engaging as an environment than any of the MP ones. Unfortunately, the <i>MP3</i> teaser seems to imply that Phazon isn't going away any time soon. I mean, it can't just go away. The storyline with it and Dark Samus needs concluding. And I'm sure it'll be cool, but I want games that aren't full of it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It doesn't need to go away. The only thing they need to do is not make it "the" critical reason for everything like they did in <i>MP2</i>. I'd rather they go back to being somewhat about Metroids...

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Basically, I don't want "Metroid" to turn into "Metroid Prime" I want them to make games outside of that timeline instance. Like, games after <i>Metroid Fusion</i>. And I want them on the Revolution. It seems that the non-prime games are becoming limited to the handheld market. Though Prime is starting to invade there, too, with <i>MP: Hunters</i>.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b><i>Hunters</i> has no appeal to me.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b><i>Hunters</i> would appeal to me a lot more if it were online. I have no one to play it with here. As it is now, I have no reason to buy it.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Honestly, <i>Prime</i> was fine. <i>Prime 2</i> just took some easy routes out of explaining things. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I'm only interested in it based on the hope that it might have a good single player mode Though it seems like it'll be the reverse of <i>Prime 2</i>, in that it'll be designed around multiplayer, with single as an afterthought, which is something that I dislike. Metroid was never something that begged for multiplayer. I don't like that they're starting to emphasize it more. I'm sure <i>MP3</i> will have a much deeper multiplayer mode in it. Honestly, I just want it to go away. I don't like the stigmata of the FPS genre in that it demands that a game have multiplayer in order for it to have any worth. If MP was in third person, I guarantee no one would be saying "OMG WHERE'S TEH MULTI."

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Multiplayer isn't a problem. My problems with <i>MP2</i> were with its overall environments, weapons, etc. A major issue for me is that I wished I was using more standard weapons, even though I want games that don't feel the same.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Yeah, it's a weird dichotomy. I want games that are new and fresh too, but for some reason, it feels... off in Metroid. I want <i>Super Metroid</i> [environments] in 3D.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Here's the thing. I knew the second I booted up Prime 2 that I could only have four weapons. I pretty much knew everything that was coming. They all seemed like changed up versions of the guns in <i>MP</i>. That bothered me. They even looked like the old guns. The fact that I couldn't have an Ice Beam in multiplayer either was bothersome.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Very true. You knew from the start that <i>Prime 2</i> would have the same template as <i>Prime</i> -- same number of suits, visors, and guns. That's something I love about <i>Twilight Princess</i>, actually (that they remade the menu with the PURPOSE of hiding the number of items).

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yeah, I like that as well. Anyway, I knew there would be a Dark and Light Beam as well. The whole two dimension thing just seems played out. I'd rather get more into the war between the Space Pirates and the Luminoth. Does Samus actually get paid for any of this? What are her motivations? Sometimes I wonder. She goes through a lot of crap.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>They always seem to come up with reasons for her to do it for free.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I wouldn't mind it being a real assignment -- having some secondary missions or something.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>That's the thing. I think they're starting to play her off like Star Fox: a mercenary, but one that works for the government. They don't seem too comfortable with the idea of a mercenary group that's completely autonomous. Star Fox was like that in <i>SF64</i>, but <i>SF Assault</i> seems to have nerfed them. They didn't collect any money, as far as I know. It was just a "save the galaxy!" story for the sake of saving the galaxy. Though, admittedly, in the case of Samus, <i>Hunters</i> is playing strongly off the idea that she's a bounty hunter on her own terms.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I'd like to see flashbacks of her youth; to really get to know her character. There's so much room for things like voice acting. They don't even have to speak English. 

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>See, while no voice acting isn't awkward in Zelda, it was VERY awkward in <i>Prime 2</i>. It was the first game, really, with NPCs and you just had to read what they said.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Those soldiers could have talked in the logs as well.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I'm not asking for English. They made a grunt at the beginning of most blocks of text, but they could've EASILY had the Luminoth speak coherently in an alien language. Full sentences, stuff that matched up and could be logically subtitled. I don't need voice acting for the logs, but when the Luminoth talked directly to Samus it would have been helpful.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>They need to hire a cinema guy and learn how to make a cinematic game. Mixing Halo's cinematic cutscene style with a Metroid game would be incredible.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b><i>Prime 2</i>'s cinematics were a mixed bag. A few parts were REALLY cool, like Dark Samus shooting the crystal behind Samus's head at the beginning. And Dark Samus freaking out after a battle with her, kneeling in pain and reaching desperately out at Samus as she looked on, shocked. That was really cool. But then there were lame things like Samus's interactions with the Luminoth and the "secret" ending. God, that was so pathetic. I mean, it got its point across, but there was NO impact to it (the secret ending).</p>

<br>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Mixed bags don't win over audiences. The intro to the game was also terrible.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Yeah, the opening was lame as hell too. Prime is another series that has a lot of potential that's yet to be explored. In this case, solely in terms of out-of-gameplay presentation.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Don't say Prime! Say Metroid.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I'm not referring to Metroid. I'm referring to Prime. "Metroid" is doing just fine on the GBA.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>I'm sick of them all being called Prime lately.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Well to me, they're very different in terms of style and thematic content. <i>Zero Mission</i> did its shit just fine -- very brief storytelling, but very well done. I really liked how they did the storytelling in <i>Zero Mission</i>. The game had brief snippets that implied events and the rest of the actually storyline events were your actions, not cinematics.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Hmm. Elaborate on that, if you could. I haven't played <i>Zero Mission</i> yet.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Oh, well at the beginning there's a text intro as Samus lands. She says what she's doing there, what her mission is, etc. From then on all storytelling is brief drawn cinematics at key points (usually when going down an elevator to a new area). Like, a five second movie of Ridley landing his ship on the planet or a three second movie of Kraid opening his eyes.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Ooh. That sounds tense.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Then, right before the <i>Zero Mission</i> bonus content, there's another text scene like the intro to the game.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Bonus content?

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Do you want to know about it? Or be surprised by it when you play it?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Half and half. Tell me a bit. I don't care if I'm surprised. With 2D Metroids its a full experience.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Let's just say that it explains what the hell the ghost ship was doing on Zebes in <i>Super Metroid</i>, and where he hell it was in <i>Metroid 1</i>.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Ooh! Does it come with free ghosts?

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>No ghosts. It's not a ghost ship in <i>Zero Mission</i>.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Bummer. Interesting, though.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>There's a lot of cool stuff in <i>Zero Mission</i>, though. It connects the game to <i>Super Metroid</i> with that ship and connects the game to <i>Prime</i> with a whole new area (one that you'll enter very early on), though you won't see nearly all of it that early.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Did they change the layout of Zebes to more match with <i>Super Metroid</i>?

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>I think so.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Good, good.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Let's just say the game isn't over when you beat Mother Brain. You can even go back to Tourian afterward. The place is all blown up and destroyed, but still there, which explains how it's still around in <i>Super Metroid</i>. There's a super missile upgrade beneath the destroyed Mother Brain container!

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Hah, it's on my list of games to play, for sure.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Though the new content after Mother Brain is VERY different from typical Metroid content. You get to a point through it, though, that you get full control and regain Metroid gameplay. The boss is almost right after that, but you can go back and do a whole lot of new stuff after that point, with your new suit abilities.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Full control? What the crap are you talking about? How is it different from Metroid gameplay?

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>If I told you that it'd completely give away what's happening, so that part will remain a surprise.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Grr. Fine

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Seriously. Buy the game. Put it at the top of your list. It has the best speed boost puzzles ever. I love <i>Metroid Fusion</i> for introducing those to the series. That and grabbing ledges were the best additions to the franchise that the game supplied.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>And fear. That game scared the crap out of me. I always felt hunted. Even though I knew it was scripted, this knowledge provided me little solace.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Yeah, that WAS great. I wish that was in <i>MP2</i>, though <i>MP2</i> DID have some cool stuff like that. Seeing Dark Samus fucking up the space pirates behind that glass was sweet.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>It wasnt like <i>Fusion</i> though.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Certainly not like <i>Fusion</i>, though. I was never afraid of Dark Samus because I knew I could kick the crap out of her. The SA-X, though, that shit was invincible, and terrifying! I've told you my idea about how I wanted the whole "other Samus" thing to play out, right?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>No.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>The scene where the SA-X is freaking out and killing the metroids? I wanted that to culminate in the realization that YOU were the clone the whole time, and the SA-X hunting you was the real Samus. I also really hope that Nintendo runs with the largely fan-supported theory that the Metroid Prime is actually a Metroid infected by an X parasite.

<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">Back to Kirby</p>

<p><i>hours later!</i>

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Oh hey, do you want to finish up that conversation from earlier?

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Sure.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>All I wanted to finish talking about was the potential for Kirby in true 3D, since the only way it's been done so far was the city mode in <i>Kirby Air Ride</i> -- a game I have yet to play. I only played it for a tiny bit at Josh [Langleys] house. It's hardly indicative of how a true 3D Kirby should be. </p>

<br>

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Kirby has a ton of 3D potential, but HAL is already stretched thin.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>So, Kirby has the same problem Mario would have in a 3D translation. Namely, the game is all about progressing straight through the level, start to finish, finding secrets along the way. Start to finish in 3D is troublesome, so it would likely end up like <i>Mario 64</i>, with several large worlds, where you try to get a star or something in the level using powerups and whatnot to do so. Kirby would actually translate to the <i>Mario 64</i> formula better than Mario did, because Kirby levels are often structured in such a way that would be well translated to 3D.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>In some ways, yeah.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>2D Mario levels are USUALLY mostly left to right. Certainly there are exceptions, but those exceptions still generally follow that formula. Kirby levels often change locales through doors a lot, use doors to move throughout a very large area on both the X and Y axes, etc. Kirby levels are more frequently built over a large plane, while Mario levels are more or less on a line that occasionally changes directions. Again, just generalizations here, as there are many exceptions on both sides. In 3D, Kirbys flight would be interesting to handle. Assuming they let him fly without getting tired, they'd have to design levels without true platforming, since he could just fly over any platforming puzzles. Levels would also have to be a lot taller than <i>Mario 64</i> levels, since Kirbys movement is free on all axes, unlike Marios, which is limited on Y in the 3D games (since he can't limitlessly fly at all times).

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Which brings up camera issues. I'm not even satisfied with Mario's current camera system.

<p><b><font color="blue">Cory: </font></b>Yeah, camera control when you move that freely would be QUITE troublesome.

<p><b><font color="red">Jeff: </font></b>Yes, yes it would.

<p><hr>

<p>For several minutes, Cory tried to get Jeff to regain interest and talk some Kirby with him, but to no avail. It was past 4am and Jeff was too far gone for saving. Perhaps another day.
