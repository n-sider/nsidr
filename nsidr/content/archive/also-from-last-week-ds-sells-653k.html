Supplementing the numbers from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=3109">yesterday's AP story</a>, Nintendo of America said today that between November 18 and November 24, over 653,000 DS systems were sold.  Combined with the over-350,000 Wii figure and "millions" of games and accessories, the week marked the most successful for Nintendo of America in its entire history.<br />
<br />
Nintendo DS' 653,000 figure also marks an additional milestone, breaking last year's Thanksgiving-week record for Game Boy Advance of 600,000 units; DS is on track to be the top-selling system in 2007.  (DS likely had a boost from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=3104">game-themed bundles</a> which became available last week.)  Wii set a record in its first twelve months of availability as well, becoming the first video game system in history to hit 5 million.
