A trailer for Square Enix's Wii title <i>Chocobo's Dungeon: Toki-Wasure no Meikyuu</i> (<i>The Dungeon of Forgotten Time</i>) was released earlier for members of their website, but the trailer has now surfaced <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/gamepage.php?id=4975">elsewhere on the internet</a>.<br />
<br />
The trailer shows the City of Forgotten Time and surrounding area in the world of Ville in which Chocobo, the lead character, talks to townsfolk, swings, and occasionally stops for a cup of coffee. All is well here, that is, until the memories of the people start being whisked away. Chocobo then enters into an area filled with bad guys, such as crown-wearing birds, bats, and a giant bull-like creature. Chocobo freely runs around the dungeon and can engage any enemies in combat, without a transition to any sort of traditional battlefield. The trailer also shows what appears to be Chocobo returning the lost memory of a factory girl, gained from defeating a certain dungeon, which in turn allows the factory to resume operation.<br />

Graphics from the game have a similar style to the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series, featuring a mild, animated sort of look. The village in particular is full of detail and life, such as butterflies flying around, vegetation throughout, rippling water, nice use of shadows, and unique buildings and structures. The dungeon shown is a floor elevated over flowing magma, with lots of use of stone. Animations are fluid and fun to watch, such as when Chocobo is staggering around in the dungeon or after a level up.<br />
<br />
The latest Chocobo's Dungeon title marks the 10th anniversary of the original game's release for Playstation. Likewise, it will continue the series' trademark random dungeons and turn-based combat in a bigger production as it marks its first Wii release. Currently, the game does not have a scheduled release date.
