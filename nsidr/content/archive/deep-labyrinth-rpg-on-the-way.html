<p>Way back in October, 2004, Nintendo Japan released an extensive list of games headed for the DS -- this included everything from <i>Final Fantasy III</i> and <i>Advance Wars</i> to smaller, more unrecognizeable names (at least, in America) like <i>pachinko, pachinko, pachinko</i>. Yet, one title of interest was never known to materialize.</p>

<p>Interactive Brain's, <i>Deep Labyrinth</i>, originally a dungeon-dwelling, 3D epic geared exclusively toward cell-phones (the first of its kind, in fact), has received a graphical overhaul in preparation for its Japanese DS release on March 23rd. As if that weren't enough, an all new soundtrack from the composers of <i>Chrono Trigger</i> and <i>Xenosaga</i> has been added, in addition to brand-new scenarios by the writers of <i>Final Fantasy XI</i> and <i>Chrono Cross</i>. Joy!</p>

<p>It's worth noting that while <i>Deep Labyrinth</i> is known for being the first fully-3D RPG to grace a cellular, an arguably more unique aspect of the title was its "GRAPE" input system (GRAphical Pattern InterfacE). Players could cast magic spells and perform other actions by hitting pattern-based number combinations on their keypads -- a system that could almost certainly be implemented to a further degree by drawing with the DS' stylus.</p> 

<p>Negotiaions for a Western release are already underway, so expect N-Sider to follow up with more details as they become available. Until then, feast your eyes (and ears) on official artwork, videos and more at the <i>Deep Labyrinth</i> <a href="http://www.ibrains.co.jp/ds/deeplabyrinth/">homepage</a>.</p>
