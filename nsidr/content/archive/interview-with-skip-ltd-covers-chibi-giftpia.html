<p>Cubed&sup3; is running their <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/news/5575">interview with Skip</a> concerning <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=988">Chibi-Robo</a></cite>,  <cite>Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol</cite> (which we <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-chibi-robo-park-patrol">previewed</a>), and the unreleased-outside-Japan <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=416">GiFTPiA</a></cite>.</p>

<p>Chibi-Robo director Kenichi Nishi is accounted for, and notes in the interview that though he has <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1953">started his own company</a> (Route24), he still works with Skip.  Even considering this, directorial duties for Park Patrol were handed off to Hiroshi Moriyama, also interviewed.</p>

<p>Nishi also, perhaps, drops a hint as to the shape of Skip's future:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Cubed&sup3;:</b> What can gamers expect from Skip for the rest of 2006 and into 2007? Will the company continue to support Nintendo, or look towards Sony and/or Microsoft?</p>

<p><b>Nishi:</b> We cannot predict what will happen in the future. However, before very long, or ASAP, I think I am going to get a tattoo saying "Nintendo" on my arm. It is still a thing in the future, so I cannot predict what is actually going to happen....</p></blockquote>
