The question is as follows: "Nintendo has stressed time and again that Revolution's most innovative element is its still-unshown controller. However, what's to stop competitors from simply copying the device?"  Read Perrin's response <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/649/649928p1.html">here</a>
