<br />
<ul>
  <li>Two players can play simultaneously</li>
  <li>Camera follows player 1; player 2 will warp to player 1's side if caught off-screen by the scroll</li>

  <li>Players have a shared lives count</li>
  <li>In both modes, knocked-out characters will be replaced by another from the team, which is built as the story progresses by characters joining</li>
  <li>Five difficulty modes from "easy" to "intense"</li>
  </ul><br />
