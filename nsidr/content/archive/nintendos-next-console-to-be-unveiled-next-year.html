<p>IGNcube has reported that, according to Manichi Interactive, Nintendo is currently planning to unveil and showcase the "true" successor to the GameCube at E3 2k5 (Electronics Entertainment Expo 2005). 

<p>Most likely in an attempt to clean up the mess that a few rediculous rumors have created in the past few days, Nintendo has reitterated that it will launch the successor to the GameCube at or around the time of its competitors. For those who missed the rumor, Nikkei (a relatively respectable Japanese news website) recently ran a story in which it implied, using outdated quotes from Nintendo President Satoru Iwata and a few misinterpreted facts, that Nintendo would try to extend the life of the GameCube by releasing a series of peripherals instead of launching its successor alongside the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 2. Both Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Japan have totally denied the rumor.  

<p>Company representatives acknowledged that a new peripheral for the GCN (GameCube) is in development, but they aren't ready to reveal any details on the device at this time. 

<p><i>"Other companies aren't expected to come out with next-generation consoles until late 2005 or 2006, and Nintendo will be launching its next-generation unit around the same time,"</i> Nintendo of Japan spokesperson Yasuhiro Minigawa told Reuters.
