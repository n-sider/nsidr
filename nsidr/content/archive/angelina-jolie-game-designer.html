<p>Rumor has it that pretty-face-turned-activist Angelina Jolie, along with Brad Pitt, has met Nintendo execs to discuss <a href="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=11083">producing a game about... UN goodwill</a>.</p>

<p>So, how do you think such a game would play?  Would it sell?  The idea appears to be to raise money to support refugees' plight, but would such an effort even work if the game didn't sell?  What do you think?</p>
