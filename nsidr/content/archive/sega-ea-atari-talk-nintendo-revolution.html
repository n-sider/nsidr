"Sega has an incredibly close relationship with Nintendo. Our products do very well on 

Nintendo's console and handheld systems. We are one of their top third party partners. We 

will put a lot of support behind the Revolution â€” there's a lot of excitement about that 

platforms potential. You've got to respect their creativity and innovation. Nintendo has 

always been motivated to build great interactive experiences, which is the lifeblood of 

our industry."

"One of the challenges for the Revolution is that it's not HD. If you think about RTS 

games, one element is the control scheme, but the other is the distance from the TV screen 

when you're playing a console game versus a PC game....One of the reasons Battle for 

Middle Earth II works so well on the [Xbox] 360 is the controller, but the other reason is 

the HD - you can see everything, frankly, as well or better as you can when you're [as 

close as you would be to a PC]...So I think there are some questions there, and the other 

issue is performance. The hardware performance is sort of current gen plus, versus the 10x 

or 20x multiple that you get on next-gen. I mean, EA is building stuff for it, but I kind 

of prefer the DS. It makes the most sense to me."

"...don't expect Nintendo to announce the Revolution's launch date or price, although we 

will learn the final name of the system. We'll also get a good idea of the launch lineup, 

which (if Nintendo sticks to the pattern of the past several E3s) will be playable on the 

show floor. Nintendo will also likely announce more additional partners for its Virtual 

Console system (an online service that will allow users to download hundreds of games from 

previous Nintendo game machines, the Sega Genesis and the TurboGrafx gaming system). The 

company also has promised to reveal the final secret of the Revolution, though it's 

anyone's guess what that might be."

"The innovative controller featured with Nintendo Revolution is perfectly suited for 

Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2, which engages players with fast-paced fighting moves. 

Gamers will be able to play in a very physical way, mimicking several of the show's most 

popular character moves and pull off awesome combos and attacks."
