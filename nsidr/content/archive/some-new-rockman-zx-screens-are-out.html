<P>The <a href="http://the-magicbox.com/0606/game060604f.shtml">Magic-Box</a> has some new screenshots from the upcoming DS run-and-gun, <i>Rockman ZX</i>.  In them we can see different color Rockman shooting things like fire!  And other blasting-like items.</P>

<P>There is also some artwork on the last page, as well as what looks like a post-stage experience/upgrade system.  <i>Rockman ZX</i> looks neat!</P>
