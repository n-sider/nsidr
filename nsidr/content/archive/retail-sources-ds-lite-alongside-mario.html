<p>I don't want to say <A href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showpost.php?p=80184&postcount=849">I told you so</a> (OK, maybe I do), but IGN's got word from retail sources that <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/691/691013p1.html">they should expect DS Lite May 7</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876"><i>New Super Mario Bros.</i></a>, already confirmed for a release that date.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all rumor at this point; no confirmation has yet come from NOA, and there may indeed yet be issues considering the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1782">half-delayed Japanese launch</a>.  But wouldn't it be great, if true?</p>
