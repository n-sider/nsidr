Business 2.0 has named Shigeru Miyamoto one of the top business figures in its second annual "<a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/biz2/0706/gallery.50whomatter.biz2/">The 50 Who Matter Now</a>" ranking.<br />
<br />
Coming it at number 20, Miyamoto was cited as being one of the top proponents of the Wii console and craze. "By marketing the Wii aggressively to 25-to 49-year-olds, Miyamoto is breathing new life into a $30 billion industry that was starting to stagnate." Miyamoto was bested by mainly other technological figureheads, such as Steve Jobs of Apple and Bruce Chizen of Adobe.<br />
<br />
In a larger average <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/biz2/0706/gallery.peoplewhomatter.biz2/jump.html">reader vote</a> of 101 business people who matter most, Miyamoto came in at 45.
