Electronic Arts, the gigantic umbrella under which a myriad studios work on Madden, Will Wright's simulation games, and many other titles announced that although they beat their profit forecast in their recent third quarter, they <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=awtpyDQPaDJ0&refer=home">felt they could have done better</a>.<br />
<br />
EA blamed their sales being held back by a dearth of titles for Nintendo's Wii, which, over a month after Christmas, is still selling out shipments to retail.  The company delivered a Wii version of its flagship Madden franchise which was favorably reviewed, but despite its <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1963">dedicated Wii studio</a>, the company feels it can do better.  In November, it acquired Salt Lake City-based Headgate Studios for the purpose of making Wii games.<br />
<br />
The company said its profit was cut by a 60% rise in spending on PS3, Wii, and 360 combined.  It has 15 Wii games in the works and has "significantly increased" their development of titles for the console.<br />
<br />
The profit announcement sent their shares higher.
