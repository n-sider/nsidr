During Nintendo's conference at E3, a new peripheral for the Wii was revealed: the Wii Zapper.<br />
<br />
Housing both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, the Wii Zapper is held in a two-handed fashion to facilitate both movement and firing. It will come packaged with software to showcase the many applications that the unit can accomplish. Already, third-party developers are creating games, such as <i>Medal of Honor</i>, <i>Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles</i>, and <i>Ghost Squad</i>, with this new interface in mind.<br />
<br />
The Wii Zapper is planned for release later this year.<br />
