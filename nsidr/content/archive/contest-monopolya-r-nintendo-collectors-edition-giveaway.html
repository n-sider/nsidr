N-Sider.com and <a href="http://www.usaopoly.com/" target="_blank">USAopoly</a> (creators of all things Monopoly<sup>Â®</sup>), have teamed up to bring to you, our readers, an exclusive contest featuring the brand new Monopoly<sup>Â®</sup>: Nintendo Collector's Edition board game. <br><br>

If you're over the age of thirteen, live on the planet Earth, and have even an iota of creative ability, this contest is for you. We are giving away 10 copies of the game (three of which are guaranteed to members of our community, so if you're a member of our forums, the odds are in your favor!). The remaining seven will be open for the general internet public to win!<br><br>

So, you're asking, what do I have to do to win?<br><br>

It's simple: design your very own Nintendo-related <i>Chance</i> card. In the traditional game of Monopoly<sup>Â®</sup>, those are the wonderful orange cards that can decide the outcome of the game, especially if it comes at a crucial time of financial woe.<br><br>

Our chance cards, however, are going to be different. Still orange, but Nintendo-related, clever, and in the simplest form: awesome.<br><br>

Below is a template that you can use (or if you don't want to, feel free to create your own design from scratch) when creating your card. If you aren't a master designer, don't fret.  We'll be judging primarily on creativity, not artistic ability (though some artistic competence certainly wouldn't hurt).
