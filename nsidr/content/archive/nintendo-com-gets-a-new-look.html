Nintendo.com is now sporting a brand new visual design&mdash;cleaner, whiter, and clearly inspired by Wii. The backbone of the site remains the same, but it's much easier to navigate now and seems to be designed for those new to video games&mdash;Nintendo in particular. In fact, the top half of the front page is devoted almost entirely to direct links to the Wii and DS sections of the site. <br />
<br />
Back when the official NSider forums were shut down, Nintendo of America said they were working on a major overhaul for Nintendo.com. As <a href="http://forums.nintendo.com/">the forum page</a> still displays the original message, the redesign is apparently not over yet. What else is to come? Nothing is known for sure, but for the time being, check out the official site and see what you think.<br />
