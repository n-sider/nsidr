Gearbox intends on developing software for the Nintendo Revolution, according to a translation from Gamefront.de.   Randy Pitchford, president of Gearbox, responded to a question from GamerCC noting that he finds the Revolution console interesting and looks forward to creating games for it.  He said the company already has ideas that would be ideal for the interface possibilities of the Revolution.  Gearbox is known for its first-person shooter <i>Brothers In Arms</i> series.
