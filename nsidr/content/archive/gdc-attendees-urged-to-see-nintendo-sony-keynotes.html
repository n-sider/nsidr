<p>The <a href="http://www.firingsquad.com/features/gdc_2006_interview/page3.asp">Firing Squad website</a> caught up with Jamil Moledin, director of the Game Developers Conference in San Jose, California.  The show runs from today through Friday, March 24.  Moledin conveyed his excitement about GDC to Firing Squad, noting that the show expects record attendance.  He also mentioned that he is looking forward to the keynote presentations from Sony and Nintendo.  "Yes, I would strongly recommend attending the two platform keynotes from Sony's Phil Harrison and Nintendo's Satoru Iwata," he said. "Trust me!"</p>

<p>Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> is scheduled to give his keynote speech entitled <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/conference/keynotes.htm#Nintendo">"Disrupting Development"</a> on Thursday, March 23, from 10:30-11:30 AM.  He is expected to detail how games such as Brain Training and hardware such as Nintendo DS have disrupted the market in a positive way.  Rumor also has it that Iwata will convey additional details regarding its Revolution console, including its final name.</p>

<p>On the show floor, Nintendo will be hosting kiosks for attendees to download Nintendo DS demos. By engaging "Download Play" from the Nintendo DS start menu, attendees can acquire short demos from games such as Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, Tetris DS, Mario Kart DS, True Swing Golf, Pok√©mon Trozei, as well as a video of Metroid Prime Hunters.  Next month, these kiosks will be available in retailers nationwide.  We'll keep you posted on any new details that come from the event.</p>
