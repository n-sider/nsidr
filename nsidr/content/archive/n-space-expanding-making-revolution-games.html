<p>A <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/orl-cfbclarke2006feb20,0,4786432.column">mention in the Orlando Sentinel</a> brings us news that n-Space, the makers of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=391"><i>Geist</i></a> for the GameCube, are expanding.</p>

<p>n-Space president Erick Dyke plans to add 20 folks in art, production, and design to the current staff of 50 while doubling their square footage by tacking on an extra 7,000 square feet.  In addition, the story confirms that n-Space is already working on titles for Nintendo's Revolution console.</p>

<p>The news n-Space is working on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> is brand-new; previously we had them <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=497&page=5#nspace">listed as unconfirmed</a>.
