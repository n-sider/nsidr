Also by way of <a href="http://www.the-magicbox.com/gaming.htm">The Magic Box</a>, Aksys has announced that it will bring a remake of PlayStation strategy RPG <i>Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth</i> to Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
The remake, appropriately titled <i>Hoshigami Remix: Ruining Blue Earth</i>, adds features not found in the original.  The title will be released in Japan on May 31.  Atlus published the original PlayStation title in North America back in August 2001 but has not said whether it will be doing the same for the DS remake.
