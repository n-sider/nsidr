From the impossibly-enticing headline department, CVG is reporting that Nintendo is <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=157280">closing Nintendo Power</a>&mdash;only, it's not the magazine that you got when you paid up for your <i>The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition</i> disc.<br />
<br />
In Japan, Nintendo Power was a kiosk-based download service that let owners of special flash-based cartridges download several Nintendo titles such as <i>Super Mario World</i> and entries in the Donkey Kong Country series.  The few kiosks that remain in operation are now being decommissioned by Nintendo.
