<p>IGN has interviewed Nintendo of America's vice-president of corporate affairs Perrin Kaplan. It's a must read interview that can be found <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/515/515140p1.html">here</a>.  Here's a short excerpt.</p>

<p><blockquote>IGN: What's the battery life for DS? </p>

<p>Perrin Kaplan: Very similar to the SP and I think very different from the PSP. I'm not quite sure why Sony said "Two to 10 hours" [for PSP's battery life]. That must mean that it's two hours. </p>

<p>IGN: What happened to Silicon Knights?</p> 

<p>Perrin Kaplan: They are going to continue the business of what they do. We respect the work that they have done. They are a really, really good team. I just think Nintendo and Silicon Knights have slightly different priorities, which does happen in business quite frequently. But we have a lot of mutual respect for each other. </p>

<p>IGN: So have you seen this rumored two-minute Zelda trailer that Nintendo was going to show off, but pulled at the last minute?</p>

<p>Perrin Kaplan: I have and it's beautiful. What's not beautiful about the new Zelda?</p>
