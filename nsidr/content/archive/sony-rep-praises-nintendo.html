In an interview over at Pocket Gamer, SCEE vice president of publisher and developer relations Zeno ColaÃ§o made a surprisingly <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/PSP/Sony+PSP/news.asp?c=3251">positive remark</a> about everyone's favorite dual-screened Nintendo handheld.<br />
<br />
When the interviewer asked ColaÃ§o his opinion about Sony's PSP, ColaÃ§o naturally defended Sony. "We were new to the handheld space," he said, but then praised Nintendo for both reaching a new audience with the release of the DS and for the fantastic games. A lack of killer apps is what he believes is keeping the PSP from taking a bigger bite out of the Nintendo-dominated handheld market.<br />
<br />
To compare sales numbers, the PSP is currently at about 20 million units in worldwide sales, whereas the DS has sold over 40 million worldwide. In North America, 8 million PSPs and 12 million DS's have been sold, and Europe is at 7 million PSPs and 11 million DS's. Japan is where the domination really shows, though; the DS sales outnumber the PSP sales over three to one with only 5 million PSPs sold and a whopping 17 million for DS.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, though, the PSP is not a failure by any means. Sony is the only company to ever survive in what has always been a market essentially exclusive to Nintendo. And yet, the DS is still selling out with every new shipment in Japan, and frequently outsells the PSP each month in both the North American and European markets.
