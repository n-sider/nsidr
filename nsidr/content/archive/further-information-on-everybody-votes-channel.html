Nintendo has released more information on the <i>Everybody Votes Channel</i>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2637">the arrival of which</a> we covered yesterday.<br />
<br />
Regional questions will be posted every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and new global questions will be posted semimonthly.  After polls close, results will be displayed in a pie chart made up of Miis, to show voters how their opinions stack up.  Some poll results will also have demographic information by U.S. state or by gender.<br />

The channel is free to download from the Wii Shop Channel right now, though you will need to get a Wii System update to use it.
