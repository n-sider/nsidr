<p>N-Sider has recently learned that despite recent rumours, the Nintendo DS will <i>not</i> be releasing early. Forum Administrator and staff writer Dean Bergmann
works at his local Electronics Boutique:</p>
<br><center><i>"Apparently we recieved a memo regarding the early release rumours. It said that if any store was caught breaking street dates, that the employee, manager, and supervisor involved would lose their jobs. Needless to say, the Nintendo DS is launching November 21st."</i></center><br>
<br>
So despite all speculation and "My friend said this because his sister's brother's cousin's roomate works at EB", the Nintendo DS will still be launching on November 21st.
