<p>Hong Kong retailer, <a href="http://www.lik-sang.com/">Lik Sang</a> had one of the first hands-on <a href="http://www.lik-sang.com/news.php?artc=3808">impressions</a> with DS Lite (released March 2nd in Japan), and now they've received two additonal color variations: Ice Blue and Navy Enamel. And boy are they <a href="http://www.lik-sang.com/news.php?artc=3815">pretty</a>. </p>

<p>It's unclear whether or not they'll make the American and European cuts later this year, but then again... that's what importing is for, right? Both the Ice Blue and Navy Enamel versions go on sale tomorrow in the land of the rising sun. Just don't get too excited -- Lik Sang is already backlogged in pre-orders from a "big fat heavy shortage", according to their site.</p>
