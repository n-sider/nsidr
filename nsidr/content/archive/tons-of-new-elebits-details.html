Courtesy <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/">N-Sider Forums</a> member <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/member.php?u=1197">Samer</a> comes a wealth of new details about upcoming furniture-tossing title <i>Elebits</i>, from <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/elebits/news.html?sid=6162540">GameSpot's recent preview</a> as well as <a href="http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20061202/ele.htm">an expos√©</a> in Japanese site Watch-Impress.<br />

<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-2987-1.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="image_styled" /><div class="image_caption_styled" style="width: 408px;">This Elebit (giving off the cute-yet-creepy vibe) is one of the game's four bosses.</div></div><br />
To begin, the game isn't just about tossing furniture, automobiles, and real estate (though that seems to be a big part of its draw).  You do this to capture Elebits&mdash;your world's power source, gone into hiding&mdash;in order to restore power to your home.  One type of Elebit will restore said power; another gives more power to your antigrav gun, which you use to move things around and capture the little buggers.  The main game has more than 30 levels of this sort of mayhem, and four bosses will make an appearance.<br />
<br />
In addition to the basic garden-variety Elebits, there are some black Elebits with pink spikes that can harm you, and you'll find rare pink Elebits&mdash;three in each level&mdash;which unlock the level you're playing for time attack, eternal, and challenge modes.  In addition to these modes, as we previousy revealed, Elebits <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2534">will have a level editor</a> and allow you to trade your creations with your friends over WiiConnect24.  You can see some of this in action on YouTube: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=hszOo99xL7w">domino effect</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1I-OeZ3wB4">zero gravity</a>.<br />
<br />
The game also features a multiplayer competition mode, which has up to four players competing to capture as many Elebits as possible&mdash;which we'd previously heard required only one Nunchuk, for player 1, to control the camera.  Watch-Impress says that you can play the multiplayer game either in that fashion or with a "random camera authority" mode that will pass camera control between different players at various intervals.<br />
<br />
Elebits looks like it will hit retail in the States on December 12.
