<p>Speaking to IGN Wii, Gearbox president Randy Pitchford said <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/721/721148p1.html">his company is supporting</a> Nintendo's upcoming Wii home console.  Gearbox is best-known for its Brothers in Arms series.</P>

<p>"Gearbox Software is enthusiastically supporting the Wii," Pitchford said to IGN Wii's Matt Cassamassina.  Pitchford laid out the price, interface, and draw of the Virtual Console as pros for the console, but also laid out cons in having to dedicate developers to thinking around the Remote as well as the lower power of the system relative to other offerings of the coming generation of systems.</p>

<p>Gearbox had no release announcements for Wii to make at this time.  Wii will release sometime in the fourth quarter of this year, with Nintendo planning to make announcements in September regarding launch plans.</p>
