<p>Issue 207 of Nintendo Power features a three-page article covering the crazy to-be-released-in-September RPG featuring Legend of Zelda character Tingle, <cite>Tingle's Rupee Land</cite>.</p>

<p>To hear Nintendo Power tell it, the game "sheds some light on the man, the myth, the legend that is Tingle".  Tingle's journey starts when a magical voice coming from the lake near his house, offering to grant him access to Rupee Land, a "utopian paradise"&mdash;but only if he brings large quantities of Rupees.  The game revolves around the Zelda currency; everything Tingle needs costs Rupees, and they're even the Tingle equivalent of hit points&mdash;run out and Tingle kicks it.</p>

<p>The game features Tingle taking part in his age-old profession of mapmaking as well, letting you fix up erroneous maps for Rupees.  A recipe system has Tingle stirring ingredients in a pot on the touch screen to create special items needed for some trades.  Tingle is moved with the control  pad in this game, but almost all other game functions are stylus-driven.</p>

<p>Battle sounds like a hectic affair, with rapid taps of the stylus leading Tingle to victory over enemies.  Tingle, being the weakling he is, also can and must hire bodyguards to help him get through certain dungeons and helping to solve puzzles.</p>

<p>The presence of this article in Nintendo Power seems to be a strong suggestion Nintendo is considering bringing Tingle's Rupee Land outside Japan.  In fact, at the end of the article, a link to a survey is provided: <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/tinglesurvey">www.nintendo.com/tinglesurvey</a> (which appears dead at the moment, so try again later!)  Those hoping to see this title on their DS may want to give that site a visit.</p>
