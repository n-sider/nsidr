<p>Easter may mean different things to different people.  To me, Easter is all about the cute, fluffy bunnies.  So lets take a look back at some of the more interesting rabbits we've seen in Nintendo video game history.</p>

It's well-known that the Nintendo Entertainment System used a programmed security chip called 10NES to prevent unlicensed cartridges from being played on it.  Even today the industry follows this closed software model.  What is less known is that in the early 90s Atari tried to circumvent this security system by copying and altering the security chip's programming.  Atari didn't like the idea that Nintendo had complete authority over the games played on its NES console.  So Atari paid a visit to the Copyright Office where it was able to gather the code used for the 10NES program.  Atari obtained and copied the source code, an infringement on Nintendo's copyright, into its own program it dubbed Rabbit. The court ultimately rejected Atari's reasoning.  Silly rabbit.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System by LJN Toys Inc. in 1989.  The game was based on the film of the same name released in 1988.  The title gave players control of detective Eddie Valliant, while the animated Roger tagged along.  The game offered a fair amount of challenge.  Players explored Toon Town, collecting items and trying their best to avoid obstacles and nefarious enemies including Judge Doom.  The most enjoyable part of the game was, no doubt, the opportunity to zoom around town in Benny The Cab.

"Getting the girl is never easy especially when competing against 12 other rivals," notes this peculiar game for Nintendo DS from Sega.  In Rub The Rabbits, a semi-sequel to Feel the Magic XY/XX, players must battle rivals to win the affection of the game's love interest through a variety of mini-games.  Although there's not much rabbit rubbing going on, the allure comes from the fact that you can customize your girl's hair, dress, and shoes.  This bunny can barely contain his excitement.

Ah, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.  What fond memories we have of thee and the speedy legs provided by the bunny hood.  It might be inferred that without you helping Link to traverse Termina Field, the world would have met its demise. It should come as no surprise then that our magical ears earn the number two spot on the Easter Bunny Fiesta Countdown.

<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=771">Satoshi Tajiri</a> is credited for creating the Pokemon series that spawned this unique character. We still haven't figured out what he or she is, but its managed to capture our hearts anyways.  And for today, we'll knight Pikachu with the title of Easter Bunny.  Hopefully you don't mind your chocolate eggs a bit on the melted side.
