<p>Perhaps inspired by the recent news that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1743">the Nintendo DS would get Opera</a>, Nintendo Gal <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/549-Revolution-To-Have-Web-Surfing.html">gave NOA a call to inquire</a> about possible web functionality for the Revolution.  Apparently, the answer is affirmative:</p>

<blockquote><p>I decided to call NOA up and ask about browsing the web with the Revolution as it just seemed a logical step. Sure enough a helpful individual answered back: "Revolution owners will have the option to purchase that functionality."</p></blockquote>

<p>An interesting answer, to be sure.  We'll see what comes of it in the months leading up to Revolution's eventual release this year.</p>
