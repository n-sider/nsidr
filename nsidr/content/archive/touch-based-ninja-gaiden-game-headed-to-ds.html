Out of Japan comes the news that Tecmo is hard at work on an entry in the Ninja Gaiden series for Nintendo DS, and this particular entry takes a very interesting turn.<br />
<br />
Rather than being played with the DS's old-school d-pad and button controls, <i>Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword</i> is played with the touch screen.  The DS is also held book-style, similar to <i>Brain Age</i>.<br />
<br />
Not much else is known about how the title will play at the moment, but <a href="http://img134.imageshack.us/my.php?image="https://static.nsidr.com/iup357158jp4.jpg">a Japanese magazine scan</a> is available for the curious.  Currently, the title is only announced for Japan&mdash;we'll bring you more details as they unfold.
