<p>Earlier today N-Sider reported by way of N-Philes that Retro Studios was not the development studio behind the Nintendo DS title <i>Metroid Prime: Hunter</i>.

<p>Thanks to the good folks over at IGN, we now know that Nintendo Software Technology Corp. (NST) is behind this eagerly awaited game. It is still unknown as to why Retro Studios was seemingly left in the dark about this game and whether or not any code from Retros pervious and current Metroid titles was used in <I>Hunters</I> creation. 

<p>Look for more details as we get them.
