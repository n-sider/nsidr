<p>Namco and Nintendo have announced their partnership to bring <i>Mario Kart</i> to the arcade, according to GameWatch.  The title is currently under development by one of Namco's studios and is being showcased at the 2005 AOU Arcade Show.  It's not known if Namco is utilizing the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/triforce-arcade-profile">Triforce</a> arcade board for the game.  The title is said to contain over 24 tracks and utilize memory cards (which may indicate an eventual GameCube version, although no such version has been officially announced).
