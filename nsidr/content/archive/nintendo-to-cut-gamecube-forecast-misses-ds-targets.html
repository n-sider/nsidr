<p>Nintendo Co., Ltd. spokesperson Yasuhiro Minagawa said Friday that Nintendo would likely be cutting its forecast for GameCube shipments from its earlier target of 2.8 million units due to poor sales of the console.  GameCube sales have been falling 40% year-on-year in the US, according to Amir Anvarzadeh of KBC Financial Products.</p>

<p>Minagawa also said that the Nintendo DS failed to meet targets in the first half of the year, but price cuts and new games helped bring the DS back on track.</p>

<p>Despite the news, Nintendo is still strong financially.  Net income rose on foreign exchange gain due to the weaker-than-estimated Japanese yen.</p>
