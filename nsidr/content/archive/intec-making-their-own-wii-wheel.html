<br />
The <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=802613">Wii Racing Wheel</a>, as it is called by GameStop, appears to function exactly the same as Ubisoft's Wii Wheel, though its form and appearance are considerably different, with a flat bottom instead of the rounded bottom on the Wii Wheel.<br />
<br />
The Wii Racing Wheel is currently scheduled by GameStop for a February 15 release, and it will sell there for $9.99&mdash;half what Ubisoft is asking for their $19.99 Wii Wheel.
