<p>Nintendo of America senior vice-president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1134">George Harrison</a>, as part of Game Informer's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1913"><cite>Red Steel</cite> coverage</a>, has given the magazine an interview offering some new details on the upcoming launch of Nintendo's new home console, still code-named Revolution.</p>

<p>Harrison expects around 20 titles to be available for the console at launch and expects about a third to be first-party titles.  Giving a little insight into Nintendo's sales strategy, he also notes that Nintendo has learned lessons from the success of Sony's PlayStation 2 and GameCube difficulties.</p>

<p>"You really make your reputation in the first year," Harrison explains.  "You've got to deliver software, not just at launch, but you've got to deliver software in the first six to nine months after launch.  In GameCube, we didn't have that, we had kind of a drought for six months after it launched. By that time your reputation starts to solidify and it's hard to reverse that after awhile."</p>
