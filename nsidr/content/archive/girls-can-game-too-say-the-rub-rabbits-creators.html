<p>We forgot to mention last week that Sega's <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=180028">The Rub Rabbits</a>, sequel to Feel the Magic XY:XX, is now available for Nintendo DS.  <a href="http://www.mtv.com/games/video_games/news/story.jhtml?id=1524471">MTV.com</a> recently interviewed the developers of the game to discuss the unique environment in which this untraditional game was created.  The game design group, eight of whom were women, had the goal of creating a lighthearted love comedy.  They feel the game's multiplayer is an especially good opportunity for connections and relationships to be made.  The creators are very adamant about seeing more video games that appeal to women and they are happy to see the trend of more females getting into game development.  "With an increase in female game developers, there would be more games with content that are more receptive to women," Sega's Nanako Yarimizu told MTV. "I'd like to see a time when women talk about games along the same line as they talk about apparel and cosmetics."
