<li>Survive nature's most devastating catastrophes in Disaster: Day of Crisis, a panicinducing
survival game for Wii. In a devastatingly short period of time, an unprecedented
wave of natural disasters has pummeled the United States. On top of this inexplicable
series of disasters, a rogue special forces unit has taken advantage of the chaos and seized
a nuclear weapon. Only Ray, a former member of an elite rescue task force, has decided
to take a stand.
<li>Cutting-edge physics and gripping visuals re-create the sheer terror of major
catastrophes.
<li>Players race a car down a mountain to escape a roaring pyroclastic flow, dodge
toppling buildings during a devastating earthquake and swim for their lives in a
raging flood. No matter what happens, fight to survive.
