<P>Nintendo Australia and Rip Curl have announced a branding partnership, which incorporates a special edition Rip Curl Game Boy Advance SP unit as well as sponsorship of the 2004 Rip Curl Pro.</P>

<P>Rip Curl is stoked to have Nintendo on board as major sponsors of the 2004 Rip Curl Pro. Ringing the Bell is the single most sought after prize on the ASP's World Championship Tour and the eyes of grommets the world over are focused on the contest and those in the water ripping it up, said Neil Ridgway, Global Marketing Chairman for Rip Curl International. It makes perfect sense then that we extend this affiliation onto the Rip Curl Special Edition Game Boy Advance SP. The kids who love the event will love the game system, and the kids who love that will in turn love the event even more. Its an on brand, on target promotion and we look forward to the start of a great association. Im not real sure about how it will effect productivity though, half the staff are fighting over the office Game Boy as I speak!</P>

<P>Nintendo will distribute the special edition unit to all regular GBA retailers, as well as Rip Curl and Surf Dive 'N' Ski stores across the country.</P>

<P>Nintendo Australia is thrilled to be able to bring together two major lifestyle brands in Rip Curl and Game Boy, said Rose Lappin, Sales and Marketing Director, Nintendo Australia. This product signifies the broad appeal of the Game Boy brand. As a proud major sponsor of the 2004 Rip Curl Pro we look forward to seeing Australian surfers playing Game Boy when the surf is flat, and Game Boy players Australia wide aspiring to take to the waves.</P>

<P>The new unit is covered with unique Rip Curl graphics and features a matching red and white colour scheme.  See images below.</P>
