<p>CNET News, among other sources, is reporting on <a href="http://news.com.com/Pokemon+USA+threat+leads+to+gene+name+change/2100-1043_3-6001323.html">legal pressure from Nintendo subsidiary Pokmon USA</a> that led from the change in name of a cancer-causing gene from "Pokmon" to "Zbtb7".</p>

<p>Geneticist Pier Paolo Pandolfi had originally dubbed the POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic gene "Pokmon" because its acronym does, in fact, spell out POKEMON.  However, press reports with headlines such as "Pokmon causes cancer" did not please the Nintendo subsidiary, leading them to threaten legal action against the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.</p>

<p>The article also notes that a gene whose mutations can lead to a number of brain and facial defects was dubbed the "Sonic hedgehog gene" in 1993, though no legal action ever came from Sega on that front.</p>
