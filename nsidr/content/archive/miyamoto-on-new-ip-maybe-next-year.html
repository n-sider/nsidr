Dean Takahashi, in an E3 <a href="http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2007/07/an_interview_with_nintendos_super_game_designer_shigeru_miyamoto.html">interview</a> with Shigeru Miyamoto, asked why Nintendo has yet to create new characters for Wii. Miyamoto said that creating new characters is not his primary goal; instead, he strives to create new experiences. However, he did say that "maybe next year" there could be some new characters introduced for Wii, in the same way Pikmin was new to Gamecube.<br />
<br />
The rest of the interview was par for the course, as Miyamoto reiterated Nintendo's core strategy&mdash;create experiences that are inexpensive and appealing to everyone. Peripherals like the Wii Wheel and Zapper, he said, are designed to be cheap to get them to as many people as possible by, for example, including them with software for minimal extra cost, if any. Nintendo is also willing to work with publishers to  included those peripherals with third-party games for a low price.<br />
<br />
For now, Miyamoto is busy with <i>Wii Fit</i> and <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>. Wii Fit does not have a release date, yet, but Galaxy will hit North American shelves November 12.
