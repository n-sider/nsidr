According to the press release, AOSS allows users to automatically set-up a secure wireless network with the push of a button. The technology instantly detects and configures other AOSS enabled devices and seamlessly creates a secure connection based on the highest level of encryption available. By incorporating AOSS in the Nintendo DS system, Nintendo DS users can easily connect to any AOSS-enabled Buffalo AirStation router/access point (AP). Nintendo DS users just have to press the AOSS button to simply establish a secure connection between the Nintendo DS device and Buffalo AirStation AP.

The AP includes software, which notifies users when their Nintendo DS devices are within range. Users can establish a connection between devices with a single click. Once the initial connection has been established, subsequent connection is automatic.
