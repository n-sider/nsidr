Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> commented further on the Nintendo Revolution controller in an article with the TaipeiTimes.  "There are too many buttons and sticks on controllers for novice players, which is likely to discourage them from ever playing games at all," he said. "We want the Revolution's controller to be relevant to everybody and we really want people to feel like they want to touch and play with it."<br>

Nintendo has said before how it would like to open up gaming to consumers of all demographics.  "Nintendo is very good at creating games that can appeal to the whole family," says Iwata. "There have been a lot of games created around excessive violence in the past few years and it seems to be escalating. From the business point of view, it doesn't make sense for us to follow suit.  We cherish our hardcore gamers, but we always try to attract as many people as possible and expand the existing gaming population."<br>

Finally, Iwata commented on how he would like to see the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection be used by all consumers that purchase a Nintendo console.   "If Nintendo sells 5 million DSs with Wi-Fi capabilities, then we want 5 million people to play with Wi-Fi," he said.
