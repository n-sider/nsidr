In <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200611/N06.1103.1640.33657.htm">a recently-held interview</a> with NOA VP of marketing and corporate affairs <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a>, Game Informer's Billy Berghammer asked whether consumers would be able to pick up component cables for Wii at retail alongside their console purchase.  The answer, for now, seems to be yes:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote"><b>GI:</b> Will component cables be available on day one?<br />
<br />
<b>Kaplan:</b> Yes, at retail and online. Best Buy, GameStop, Circuit City, etc... and Nintendo.com.</div><br />
Astute news readers will recall Kaplan's recent gaffe where she claimed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2420">Wii would be region-free</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2434">a correction from NOE</a> indicating the opposite.  However, Kaplan assures GI she's right this time:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote"><b>GI:</b> Back at the New York Wii event you were quoted as saying the Wii will be region-free.<br />
<br />
<b>Kaplan:</b> Yeah, I made a mistake. I had understood early on that that was going to be the case, and I made a mistake and I have to own up to that. And, as a matter of fact, I make very few of them. If you ask my husband, he'll tell you that it's not true.</div>
