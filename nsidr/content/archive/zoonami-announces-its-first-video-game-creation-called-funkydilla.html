<p>IGNCube has confirmed that UK-based developer Zoonami will show a rhythm-based action game called "Funkydilla" at the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>

<p><i>Funkydilla</i> is said to allow players to "arrange vocal lines and phrases, which rise from the bottom of the screen to the top, in any order or combination," to create their own mixes of music.  The game will also feature both cooperative and two-player battles.</p>

<p>"The game industry badly needs new ideas and gameplay innovation," Martin Hollis, founder and director of Zoonami, told IGN. "Funkydilla is different from all the other games in its genre."</p>

<p><i>Funkydilla</i> is in development for multiple consoles and currently lacks a publisher.</p>

<p>For more information on <i>Funkydilla</i> and the first gameplay screen, visit <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/508/508752p1.html">IGNCube.com</a>.</p>

<p>It is not known if this is the same game as the rumored Nintendo-published title called <i>Game Zero</i>.  Below is a teaser describing <i>Game Zero</i> that Zoonami published on its website all the way back in January 2000, when the company was first established.</p>

<p>We assume the upcoming E3 Expo will explain more.</p>
