IGN reports that troubles Japanese players are encountering playing the recently-released <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> are being chalked up by Nintendo to a combination of the dual-layer disc the game is on (a rarity for Wii titles) and either dust or tobacco ash settling on the system's optical lens.<br />
<br />
Nintendo is offering customers affected by the problem a free cleaning if they care to bring their Wii into a service center, since there's no way a Wii owner can clean the lens without cracking the case and voiding the warranty.  Whether this will present a problem to American Wii owners and if Nintendo plans to do anything about it remains to be seen&#8212;Brawl releases stateside on March 9.<br />
