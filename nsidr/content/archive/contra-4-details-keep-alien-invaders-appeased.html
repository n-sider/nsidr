After <i>Contra 4</i> was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2878">announced</a> a little over a week ago, new details began to flow more freely. The latest <i>Nintendo Power</i> contains an in-depth interview with those responsible for Contra 4, and last week's 1Up Show featured the first <a href="http://gamevideos.com/video/id/12644">video</a> of the game in action.<br />
<br />
In Nintendo Power's interview, the team behind the game assures gamers that they are working tirelessly to reproduce the Contra experience. They have played the previous games in the series extensively and are taking the best parts and building the game from there. Also promised are tunnel stages, as seen in some past Contra games, as well as vehicles, and even the ability to hijack a miniboss.<br />
<br />
The game is completely 2D in almost every aspect. All of the graphics are sprite-based, but the game does take advantage of the DS' 3D processor. 1Up's preview shows several beautiful levels, including a waterfall, a lush jungle, and an ocean level with a huge fish boss. The video also showed off the classic Contra gameplay that fans of the series have come to love, as well as the new grappling hook, which serves as a means of getting from the bottom screen to the top screen quickly.<br />
<br />
All in all, those who previewed the game only had positive things to say. Any doubts about WayForward's ability to handle the classic franchise should be put to rest.
