<p>You may have noticed a few cosmetic changes on the front page of N-Sider over the last few weeks.  One of the more noteworthy changes has been the addition of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/industry.php">Nintendo Employee</a> alphabetical list.  You can look-up practically every Nintendo employee there is or has been, view the games they've worked on and much more.  If you haven't already, check it out <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/industry.php">here</a> or click on the header located above named "Industry".</p>
