<p>By way of MCV comes the news that <a href="http://www.mcvuk.com/newsitem.php?id=758">Laurent Fischer now has the senior marketing job</a> at Nintendo Europe <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1648">previously occupied</a> by <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick.</a></p>

<p>Fischer was previously marketing director at Nintendo France, where he oversaw the launch of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=8">Game Boy Color</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=23">Game Boy Advance SP</a>.</p>

<p>Along with the announcement, Nintendo Europe reconfirmed its intent to bring <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a> to market in that territory in 2006, contrary to recent speculation that it would not hit stores until 2007.</P>
