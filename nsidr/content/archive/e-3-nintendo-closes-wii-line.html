<p>While on the E3 show floor covering Nintendo DS titles, I had a conversation with some of Nintendo's floor walkers &mdash; employees well-versed in the games at the DS bar.  They informed me that Nintendo has, at least for the moment, closed the line to get inside the large sectioned-off area of Nintendo's booth dedicated to playing <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2099">the 27 playable Wii titles</a> here at the show.</p>

<p>The booth is quite impressive on the inside, but regrettably, it's become quite jammed up.  The walls are lined with playable Wii stations, packed perilously close together, and prospective players simply line up behind their station of choice.  Unfortunately, there's very little room to line up in the first place, and some demos take a very long time to finish (notably, <cite>Super Mario Galaxy</cite>).</p>
