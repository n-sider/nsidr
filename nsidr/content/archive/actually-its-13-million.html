<p>Remember when <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1624">we reported DS selling 10 million worldwide</a>?  Well, <em>someone</em> forgot to count Europe, as NOE has <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/press_release.php?aid=13894">announced today</a>.</p>

<p>With European DS totals thrown into the mix, we now see that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> sales are closer to the 13 million mark worldwide; this number includes not only Japan and North America, but also Latin America and Australia as well.  NOE would also like you to know that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><i>Nintendogs</i></a> has sold 1.6 million in the territory since its October release, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a> has pulled off 800,000 copies since late November.</p>

<p>NOE expects great things in 2006 out of <i>Prof. Kawashima's Brain Training: How old is your brain?</i> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a>, both slated to be released in that territory very soon.</p>
