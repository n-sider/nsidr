<p>Starting Aug. 15, Nintendo's Metroid Prime Bonus Bundle gives consumers a Nintendo GameCube system and not one but two free discs. The first disc contains a complete version of the award-winning Metroid Prime game, while the bonus disc contains a playable demo version of the highly anticipated sequel, Metroid Prime 2 Echoes.

<p>The bonus disc features a wealth of information about the Metroid franchise, such as:

<p>-an exclusive playable demo of Metroid Prime 2 Echoes

<br>-The Metroid Chronicle, an interactive history of the Metroid franchise

<br>-two Metroid Prime 2 Echoes cinematic trailers

<br>-a stunning Metroid Prime art gallery

<p>And the whole bonus bundle comes in a Metroid-styled Nintendo GameCube packaging. This incredible value will be available only while supplies last.

<p>Game enthusiasts who already own a Nintendo GameCube can get the bonus disc in one of two ways, while supplies last. The bonus disc can be obtained by purchasing a one-year subscription or renewal to Nintendo Power magazine, the official print source for product-related updates and information. The second option allows "My Nintendo" members of Nintendo.com to obtain the bonus disc by registering a Nintendo GameCube system and five eligible software titles. Complete details for both options can be found at www.nintendopower.com/metroidprime2.
