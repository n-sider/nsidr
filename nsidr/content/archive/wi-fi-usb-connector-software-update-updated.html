<p>Nintendo of Europe has <a href="http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/usb/en/">released version 1.02</a> of the driver software for the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector.  The update reportedly contains fixes for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The error that occurred in the installation of the version with drivers already installed</li>
<li>The problem in which an application error occurred when the registration tool was booted</li>
<li>The problem in which the CPU load was quite high when the adapter was not connected</li>
  </ul>

<p>NOA has yet, to our knowledge, to offer this update to customers stateside, but it appears that the update works for all regions.  If you find out otherwise, please <a href="mailto:news@n-sider.com">let us know</a>.</p>

<p><b>Updated:</b> Some users are reportedly <a href="http://www.gamekult.com/tout/forum/lire_364182.html">having serious trouble with the update</a>, though we can't confirm whether the problem is isolated or not.  The best advice that can be given is this: with any software update, if it ain't broke, don't try fixing it.</p>
