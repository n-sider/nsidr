<p>News from Famitsu indicates that Tecmo's <cite>Super Swing Golf Pangya</cite>, previously <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/703/703323p1.html">noted by IGN</a> to be lacking online play (in contrast to the PC version, which made its name with online play), will now <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2006/06/09/104,1149823204,54614,0,0.html">have online play on Wii after all</a>.</p>

<p><cite>Pangya</cite> is slated for the Wii with no particular release date attached to it yet.  It may well be a Japan-only title, by IGN's reckoning.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Famitsu has updated the article since we first looked at it, it seems.  They now say that <cite>Pangya</cite> won't necessarily be online &mdash; but its online status is unspecified.  So the title may well be online, or it may be offline.  We'll find out for sure when it gets closer to release, no doubt.</p>
