<p>Nintendo Japan will be combining and then selling value-priced Nintendo titles.  (Think back to the Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt combo.)  IGN discovered that Amazon Japan already has the titles listed on its website.  Called W Packs (W is said to correlate with "double" in Japan), two games will be combined and offered for a price lower than the titles would sell for individually.  Ten of these packs are scheduled for release on July 23.
