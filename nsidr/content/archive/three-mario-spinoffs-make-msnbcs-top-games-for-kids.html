<p>MSNBC has published <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10052610/">their list of top-rated video games for kids</a>, and Mario-universe titles take up spots two through four.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=992"><i>Super Mario Strikers</i></a> leads off at #2, accompanied by the kid quote "Im usually not into sports games, but this is definitely what I would buy."  The game is described as "pretty chaotic", preferring fun over realism.</p>

<p>Following <i>Strikers</i> is <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=990"><i>Mario Superstar Baseball</i></a> at #3 and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=989"><i>Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix</i></a> at #4.  The remainder of the list is dedicated to two titles not appearing on GameCube (#1, #5) and the remaining two titles cross-platform movie spinoffs.</p>
