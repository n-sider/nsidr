It's Friday again, which means the European Virtual Console gets another update. This week, Wii owners get to play pinball with devils and challenge friends in Kirby's action puzzler.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Kirby's Ghost Trap</i> (SNES, 800 points)</li>
  <li><i>Devil's Crush</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 points)</li>
  </ul><br />
These two games bring the total number of European VC releases up to 116.
