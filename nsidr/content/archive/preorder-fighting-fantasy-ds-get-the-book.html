<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3949-1.jpg" width="177" height="272" class="image_styled" /></div>I haven't yet mentioned the upcoming Aspyr-published <i>Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain</i> game here, but this week I got an interesting item&mdash;the original book of the same name by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, which will also be given as a bonus who preorder the game from GameStop&mdash;and something that was, admittedly, completely new to me as an American not quite so much into fantasy RPGs when it was published.<br />
<br />
At first blush, it may bear a very passing resemblance to the <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i> series that I <i>do</i> remember from my childhood, sporting 400 points to turn to depending on your choices; but it's got its feet firmly planted in dice-rolling pen-and-paper RPGs, with a character sheet and stats to manage.  (Die rolls are printed on the bottoms of pages, too, so you don't even need a real pair to play, just flip through the book randomly and read the roll of the page you stop on.)  It recommends you make yourself a map as you go along as you'll probably play through a few times before you make it to the end; this seems to me to be a rather good suggestion, for as thin as the book looks it can get pretty deep.<br />
<br />
I'm told the book is only going to be available in the U.S. through the preorder bonus scheme; indeed, on the back cover there are only Canadian and U.K. prices listed.  Definitely one of the cooler preorder bonuses I've seen, and the game itself&mdash;a first-person RPG&mdash;looks like no slouch either.
