It's becoming increasingly clear that Microsoft is interested in making sure Wii remains on the sidelines of public perception, classifying it at every opportunity as anything but a threat to their Xbox business.  And with that, we have Xbox VP Peter Moore chipping in in <a href="http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/758/758874p1.html">an IGN interview</a>:<br />
<br />
"The innovation that the Wii is, I'm certainly a big fan of. It ties in exactly with what Nintendo needs to do. And it ties directly into their strong intellectual property that is more youth oriented and more family oriented."<br />
<br />
Moore reserved his negative comments for what he does consider his competition: Sony's PlayStation 3.  Moore criticized the PS3's library as well as its online service, saying Sony was "till trying to get it up to speed and there's nothing really there that I can really point to that I wish we had."
