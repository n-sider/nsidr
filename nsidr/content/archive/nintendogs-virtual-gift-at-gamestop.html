<p>Nintendo of America announced today that over the Halloween weekend (October 28 through October 30), Nintendogs owners will be able to <a href="http://www.nintendogs.com/trick/">visit GameStop stores and pick up a "virtual gift"</a> and voice message from Haylie Duff via the game's Bark Mode.</p>

<p>This marks the first time Nintendo has offered anything wirelessly to DS owners outside the Nintendo World store in NYC, when it offered the Jack Russell book (unlocking the secret Jack Russell Terrier breed) to visitors present for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>'s visit.</p>
