<p><a href="http://www.cube-europe.com/">GameCube Europe</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">GameFAQs</a> had updated their Nintendo DS page with the following titles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Metroid Prime Hunters</li>
<li>Picto-Chat</li>
<li>Super Mario 4 x 4</li>
<li>WarioWare Inc. DS</li>
  </ul>
<p>Although the page seems to have been taken down, the titles can still be found in their database by doing a <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/search/">search</a>. Whether or not this is just speculation on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/">GameFAQs</a> part or the titles are just place holders remains to be seen.</p>
