Showtime, known for airing boxing events, is bringing the experience home for Wii owners with <i>Showtime Boxing</i>. The game will use the Wii controllers to put players in control of attack and defense in the ring, throwing punches, ducking, dodging, and blocking.<br />
<br />
Choosing from 14 boxers (seven heavyweights, seven lightweights), players will compete in either one-off bouts or take on a series for title belts across four recreated stadiums with individual characteristics: New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. After choosing a boxer, they can be customized with different hair, shorts, gloves, and boots. Along the way, more boxers, arenas, clothing, and gloves can be won. To ensure success, each fighter has a special three punch combo to help regain control of the fight.<br />
<br />
Showtime Boxing is the latest game from <a href="http://www.zoodigitalpublishing.com/product-item.php?id=308">Zoo Digital Publishing</a>. It is due for release on December 7 in North America.
