<br />
It's good to be able to relax sometimes, isn't it?<br />
<br />

After last week's globe-trotting marathon, I was finally given the chance to concentrate on my reason for being out here in the first place.  Today the senior staff at L&L were actually around so they took care of their own clients, while I headed off first thing in the morning to survey some of the atoll's smallest denizens.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />

Like these gobies clustered near the edge of one of the reef's many gorgeous corals.<br />

Or this clown fish hovering within the refuge of an anemone's stinging arms.<br />
<br />
Chordates, especially ray-finned fish fill the waters so this time around I made a special effort to record invertebrates.  I was hoping to get a few nice pictures of the colorful sea slugs native to the atoll but no luck.  I did see my first red-streaked box crab though.<br />
<br />

It was just hanging out in the shallows.  I gave it a piece of bait fish, which it happily chowed down on.  There were also quite a few of these:<br />

<br />
Crystal jellyfish.  Jellyfish look so incredibly delicate, and yet they're amazing predators: paper thin bowls of specialized cells and water, trailing an armada of harpoons.<br />
<br />
The last invertebrate I spotted was this sea star.<br />
<br />

<br />
It was gliding along on its battery of tube feet, traveling from one coral island to the next.  When I was a little kid, starfish were always my favorite things to find on the beach.<br />
<br />
My luckiest sighting of the day, however, was this:<br />
<br />

<br />
This strange object is the egg case of a Japanese bullhead shark.  Shark egg cases come in an amazing variety of bizarre shapes.  Colloquially, they're called mermaid's purses.<br />
<br />
By the time I finished up my survey for the day it was edging towards evening.  Still, I made it back to the island just in time to catch the end of some really exciting work being done with the local wild dolphins.  A marine biologist from Japan has been working with L&L on a project that involved training wild dolphins to perform behaviors on command.  Here are a couple of the participants:<br />
<br />

<br />
This is Painter, a short-beaked common dolphin,<br />
<br />

<br />
and Gamble, a spectacled porpoise.  Gamble treated me to a show of one of my favorite behaviors:<br />

<br />
the tail walk!  They may look cuddly, but dolphins are solid muscle and this "trick" is nothing short of a display of strength and skill.<br />
<br />
It really was a lovely day today.  I recorded a lot of data for my research, talked to a well respected senior marine biologist, and got to meet a charming pair of finny performers.<br />

<br />
I think I'll tune up my guitar and just take it easy for the rest of the evening.
