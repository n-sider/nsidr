It's the dawn of a new week once again and you know what that means!<br />
<br />
<b>VIRTUAL CONSOLE MONDAY</b><br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3074-1.jpg" width="384" height="51" class="image_nostyle" /></div><br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Kirby's Adventure</i> (NES, 1 player, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Ice Climber</i> (NES, 1-2 players, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Kid Icarus</i> (NES, 1 player, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
Some real gems this week, with Kirby's Adventure being entirely worth the dough, and Kid Icarus completely deserving of a spin (if only for the latecomers to see how basic it really is and ponder why we're all clamoring for a sequel for some reason).  And hey, that fancy Wii suspend state is always appreciated!  Ice Climber... not so much, but two out of three ain't bad, right?
