<p>Business 2.0 recently took <a href="http://www.business2.com/b2/web/articles/0,17863,1133944,00.html">an admittedly short stab</a> at what makes the Nintendo DS a winning proposition over Sony's PlayStation Portable.  That they came up with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967">Nintendogs</a> is no surprise, of course.</p>

<p>Quoting Japanese sales figures and lamenting the dearth of readily available US sales figures, they then offer their take on what makes the Nintendo DS <em>the</em> platform for the virtual pups, noting its networking capabilities via Bark Mode, intuitive touch-screen interface providing simplicity, and of course the capability to directly "touch" your dog, offering emotional bonding far beyond what Tamagotchi ever could.</p>
