At a recent conference call with investors, THQ president Brian Farrell discussed holiday quarter sales and their new DS franchise, the 5th Cell-developed <i>Drawn to Life</i>. Farrell says Drawn to Life has sold several hundred thousand copies worldwide and is largely responsible for a 94 percent rise in THQ's DS game sales over the past three fiscal quarters.<br />
<br />
Farrel also informally announced that THQ will be bringing the Drawn to Life franchise to Wii, along with several other Wii-exclusive titles to be announced in the coming weeks.<br />
