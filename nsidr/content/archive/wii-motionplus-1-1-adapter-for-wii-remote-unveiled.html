Nintendo officially announced the Wii MotionPlus this morning, a remote add-on which will allow full 1:1 motion detection.  From the official release:<br />

"Every slight movement players make with their wrist or arm is rendered identically in real time on the screen, providing a true 1:1 response in their game play."<br />
<br />
More information will be revealed at Nintendo's E3 press conference tomorrow morning.  One must wonder about the timing of this announcement, given that Microsoft's press conference (at which they are rumored to be announcing a motion-control peripheral of their own) takes place in less than two hours.
