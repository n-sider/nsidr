<p>In a roundtable discussion yesterday after E3, Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma talked about the upcoming sequel to <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>.

<p>Here are a few highlights from the chat:

<p><b>Shigeru Miyamoto:</b> <i>Just very quickly though, as for the reason why Link has changed, there were very, very, very, very many people out there who wanted Link to change [laughs]. Also there's another reason and that's that in developing the Wind Waker we know that we were going to be creating a game in which Link was a young boy and trying to create a very active and very energetic young boy and trying to choose the right style for portraying the young boy in a game like that we tried many different experiments. The ultimate decision we came to was that the cel-shading in Wind Waker was the best option for expressing that.</i>

<p><b>Eiji Aonuma:</b><i> I'm sure all of you saw the video of the new Legend of Zelda game at this point. One thing that I'd like to point out to everybody is that none of that is CG. It's all done in real-time and running on the [game] engine. That movie was actually created by somebody who took a version of the game, played it, videotaped and then cut the pieces together to make the movie.</i>
