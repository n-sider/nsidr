 In a press release from Nintendo Europe today, it has been announced that the designers of the Internet browser Opera are working on a Nintendo DS version of their software, which uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

 The game will be held on a simple DS Card, and is going to supposedly make great use of the touchscreen. Can't really see how they could miss there. Currently slated for Japanese release in June, it should retail for around 3800 yen (Approx. US$30).
