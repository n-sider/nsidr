Maria Menounos, better known as eye candy for teenage boys as the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1172764/">sexy nurse</a> in <i>Fantastic Four</i>, has signed on to appear alongside the digital Sean Connery in EA's <i>From Russia With Love</i>.
<br><br>
Though her exact role in the game is unknown I theorize that she will be integral to the segments of the game that have nothing to do with the 1963 hit film.

"I am honored to be a Bond girl and be a part of the Bond legacy.  To star in a video game with Connery, the original Bond, is incredible," stated  Menounos.
