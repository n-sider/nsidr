<p>Nintendo Europe said it no longer intends to release the Game Boy Advance e-Reader in Europe, according to Cube-Europe.com.  Nintendo Europe feels there isn't the market for the product, however the company says it still plans to release some of the product through other means.</p>

<blockquote><p><font size="2">"We won't launch E-Reader in Europe," Shelly Pearce, head of PR stated. "We don't think the market potential is great enough to launch the product in Europe - however we will make the downloadable elements that cards provided available via different routes."</font></p>
