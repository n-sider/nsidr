<p>The Seattle Post-Intelligencier has posted some comments former Nintendo Executive Howard Lincoln made after Nintendo's E3 media briefing.</p>

<p>On the Nintendo DS: <blockquote><i>"First of all, I thought they did a marvelous job. It was a great press conference, and Reggie (Fils-Aime), our new marketing executive, I thought did a tremendous job. This Nintendo DS looks spectacular. It has so many functions, and the way it was presented today was very effective in getting all those features out -- the wireless feature, the touchpad feature, the dual-screen feature, one screen in 3D, the other in 2D. So many things that developers can focus on, and so it's not just an add-on product, it's a completely new product, a completely new category."</i></blockquote></p>
