Aksys Games announced today their plan to bring the vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up <i>Castle of Shikigami III</i> to North America. In Japan, the series is known for its intense difficulty and colorful characters.<br />
<br />
This particular game features ten different characters (each with their own weapons and powers, of course), a branching story, the Tension Bonus System which rewards players for living on the edge, and a two-player co-op mode.<br />
<br />
Prepare for bullet hell when Castle of Shikigami III hits store shelves Spring 2008.
