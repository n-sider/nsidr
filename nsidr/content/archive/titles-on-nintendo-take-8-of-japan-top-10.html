<p>The <a href="http://www.m-create.com/eng/e_ranking.html">latest numbers from Media Create</a>, measuring the Japanese game market, are in, and titles for Nintendo platforms own 8 of the top 10 slots &mdash; 5 on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>.</p>

<p>While the newly-released PlayStation 2 version of <i>Resident Evil 4</i> took the top spot, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a> held second, selling 130,355 copies (in addition to the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1566">over 325k it sold on its release week</a>).</p>

<p>The Nintendo DS hardware is certainly holding its own, selling 176,958 units &mdash; as we've seen a few other times this year, more than all other hardware platforms combined.  In stark contrast to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1585">the US market</a>, where (in August-October numbers) <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a> as a platform outsells Nintendo DS by nearly a third, this past week in Japan saw the Nintendo DS selling nearly 12 times as many hardware units as the Game Boy Advance in all its forms.  We'll have to see what the US holiday numbers look like to see if this trend even comes close to showing its face on this side of the Pacific.</p>
