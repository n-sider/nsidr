Cambridge studio Zoonami, created by ex-Rare software head and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=18"><i>Goldeneye 007</i></a> producer/director <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=942">Martin Hollis</a>, has announced <i>Zendoku</i> for Nintendo DS and Sony's PlayStation Portable.<br />
<br />
Zendoku appears to expand on the gameplay of the popular Sudoku pen-and-paper puzzle game, which has recently made several appearances on the Nintendo DS in Nintendo's <i>Brain Age</i> and <i>Sudoku Gridmaster</i>, as well as myriad other third-party titles.  Zendoku takes Sudoku and, according to Hollis, turns it "into a puzzling, battling, micro-gaming, fighting extravaganza."<br />
<br />
No release date has yet been set.  Zendoku will be published by Eidos.
