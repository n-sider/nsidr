GameCube-Europe recently attended the <i>Donkey Konga</i> Tour. You can find a colorful description of their experience at the event <a href="http://www.cube-europe.com/news.php?nid=6771">here</a>. The tour mainly consists of a bunch of games, both old and new, inside and around a large dressed up truck. Nevertheless, the report of the event was interesting and worthwhile.
