<p>Okay, enough is enough.  How much reassurance do we need?  How many confirmations must we hear?  How many interviews should we read before we face the reality that The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is appearing on the Nintendo GameCube  during Fall '06 at the earliest?</p>

<p>Apparently, we need more.  NOA executive vice president of sales and marketing, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie  Fils-Aime</a>, was interviewed during a segment for Spike TV's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh0Lw1qflJ4">Game Head show</a>.  Reggie reiterated to show host Geoff Keighley that The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess will release later this year for the Nintendo GameCube.</p>

<p>I don't believe you, Reggie.  Please let me hear it again.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p><b>EGM interview (March 2006 issue):</b> Speaking of Zelda, best-case scenario, it's a few months away from the Revolution launch, worst case scenario is it's coming out at the same time. Is there ever a point where you believe that it would be better to switch it over to Revolution? Or does it not matter, since the Revolution will be backward compatible with Cube games?</p>

<p><b>Reggie:</b> Exactly. I think that our senior management has made it very clear that bringing Zelda: Twilight Princess out on GameCube is important, that we want to satisfy the GameCube fan base and have it be on that system. You've said the obvious, which is that [because] Revolution's backward compatible, it will almost effectively be a launch title for Revolution. The trick will be what makes it special to play on Revolution, and to the extent that we could create something like that, boy, wouldn't that be fantastic? Certainly one of the things that I would love to see is something that makes Zelda, when it's played on Revolution, do something magical. And I think that any Nintendo fan would love to see that.</p>

<p>So lets review.</p>

<p><ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is releasing for GameCube.
<li>Since Revolution is backwards compatible, expect enhancements when played on the console.
<li>Zelda won't arrive until fall at the earliest, not coincidentally about the time of Revolution's launch.
  </ul></p>
