Nintendo Europe has announced that in one year and ten months, the Nintendo DS has <a href="http://uk.ds.ign.com/articles/757/757274p1.html">sold through ten million units</a> on the continent, making it the fastest ever gaming hardware to do so.<br />
<br />
Europe has really taken to the DS, and NOE marketing director Laurent Fischer pins the responsibility on the Touch! Generations line.  "Nintendo DS topped the six million mark in September and has continued to go from strength to strength with thousands of new people being introduced to gaming through the Nintendo DS. Its appeal to both gamers and non-gamers means it has expanded the gaming population significantly."<br />
