<b>Wave Race: Blue Storm</b><br>

<font size="1"> 1996-2001 Nintendo</font>



<p><i>Wave Race: Blue Storm</i> is the GameCube sequel to the revolutionary Nintendo 64 title released in November of 96. The original idea was to create a water-hovercraft racing title in the vein of F-Zero. Displeased with the progress of the title, Nintendo shifted gears and in turn created an acclaimed water jet-ski franchise known for its remarkable physics and sheer adrenaline pumping fun. <i>Wave Race: Blue Storm</i> takes all the best elements of the original, improves on them, and adds some great new features that help expand the scope and fun of the game.



<p><b>Features</b>

<ul>

<li>Original tracks and revamped versions of originals

<li>Customizable waves and weather conditions

<li>Dolby Pro Logic Surround Sound

<li>Supports 480p progressive scan HDTVs

<li>Four player support

<li>Only for Nintendo GameCube

  </ul>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/9stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Anthony:</b> <i>Wave Race: Blue Storm</i> is without a doubt one of the greatest launch titles I have ever picked up for a system. The game doesn't blow you away immediately, but it places it's baited hook on you and slowly reels you in. The controls are much stiffer than <i>Wave Race 64</i>, and for the better. In order to succeed in the circuits, you definitely have to absorb the track, and learn when and how to cut specific turns to stay ahead of the pack. While at first the new control may seem like a negative thing, you soon learn that it makes the game much deeper, and ultimately more rewarding to a skilled player. The AI opponents are fierce, and will pound you and chase you around the track like you stole something; as if the track itself wasn't difficult enough.



<p>Graphically the game is great. While if you look at a screenshot you may not be blown away, the true power of the game comes from seeing it in motion. The water is absolutely brilliant! Each jet-ski creates it's own wake in the water, changing the current of the water and consequently your own jet-ski, combined with the improved <i>Wave Race 64</i> physic scheme; it all comes together for some mindblowing water motion. There are also several effects like some heavy use of  environmental reflections, myst, lens flare, lighting, and some rather nifty camera lens' water effects. Some of the environments can look bland, probably because of the use of some rather dull colors, but in general the better looking stages look really good.



<p>The most amazing thing about the game that contributes to its graphics and gameplay, is without a doubt the customizable weather. Rain literally changes the way you play a track, the water level is higher and allows you to reach certain ramps and at the same time pushes some rocks or obstacles underneath the water. The waves also become extremely turbulant. You can literally see the rain hitting the watter and causing small ripples in it, the attention to detail is very impressive.



<p>The track design is just about as good as it can get for a racer. While more tracks would have been nice, especially for multiplayer mode, the ingenious design of one track in <i>Wave Race: Blue Storm</i> beats out what I've seen in other racers entire track selection. Did I mention the multiplayer mode in this game is flawless? Highly recomended.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/8stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Brenden:</b> This game is wonderful. The controls are great, the graphics are beautiful and the multiplayer is fast and furious. Blue Storm will try your patience, as it has one of the steepest learning curves I've seen in a racing game. I'll admit that there were a couple of times when I felt like giving up. It just wasn't the experience I expected. Once I had gotten used to the controls, it was like a dream, I couldn't believe how much fun it was.

<P>

The multiplayer is amazing. I only had the opportunity to try it out with two players, but everything looked just as detailed with the gorgeous water and animated riders. The only downside is that you can't actually play a multiplayer championship, something I would've liked to be able to do. On top of that, I think the number of courses could've been increased. The variations in the courses aren't anything huge. I guess I may be greedy, but I just wanted a little bit more.

<P>

The coaches (announcers) are an interesting addition to say the least. It's nice to know how far you're in the lead after you complete a lap, but that's about it. Past that, some of the coaches just get really annoying. It's not a big deal, and I've learned to live with it, but it's definitely something I could've done without.

<P>

Because of the problems I have with the lack of tracks, the annoying coaches, and the steep learning curve (which would put off some casual gamers), I just couldn't bring myself to give Wave Race a 9. But it is most certainly in deserving of an 8.



<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/10stars.jpg" align="left"><b>Brent:</b> Nintendo has really got their work cut out for them. There's so many racing games out there that you can bump into walls, ram into your opponents, crash and burn, play with your eyes closed, and still finish in first place. Unlike with Waverace 64, players won't be able to just jump right in and start racing. There are a lot of racers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Control takes a tad bit getting used to, but once you figure out that you have to use the L and R buttons, it's simple. The fact that you can check the weather forcast and choose the order you want to play the courses ahead of time create a neat strategy aspect to the game that almost everyone will be able to appreciate (who wants to play the 'La Razza Canal' in stormy weather, anyways?).  The multiplayer is fun and the stunt mode is back, but this time there are more stunts, so players frustrated with the length of Luigi's Mansion will keep busy with Waverace for a very long time. To be perfectly blunt, Waverace: Blue Storm is the best game out of the whole launch bunch and a worthy addition to any gamer's library of GameCube games.
