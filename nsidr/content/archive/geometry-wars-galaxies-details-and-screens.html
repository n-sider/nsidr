Sierra Entertainment has officially announced today that they are publishing <i>Geometry Wars: Galaxies</i>, the "next evolution" of the hit Xbox Live Arcade title <i>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved</i>.  The sequel is being developed by Kuju Entertainment.<br />
<br />
Along with the announcement comes some key details and clarifications to our <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2777">original story</a> based on the Nintendo Power report.  The game is for 1-2 players, with both co-op and versus modes making an appearance&mdash;brand new to the series, as Retro Evolved was single-player only.  Online leaderboards will be available in the Wii version, and the Wii and DS versions will link up wirelessly to unlock new features.<br />
<br />
The single-player story mode will involve quests to save solar systems one by one in both new and classic stages, which you'll be doing with new control schemes created specifically for Wii and DS, of which Bizarre's Ben Ward <a href="http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/791/791929p1.html">says</a> "we're confident that the games will play superbly on the new platforms and will avoid the trap of adding a new control method just for the sake of it."  Finally, the full version of Retro Evolved will be included in the title.<br />
<br />
Both versions of the game will arrive this fall.  For your viewing pleasure, we have <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=5201&view=screens">new screenshots</a> of the Wii version, or you can visit the game's <a href="http://www.sierra.com/geometrywarsgalaxies/">official site</a>.
