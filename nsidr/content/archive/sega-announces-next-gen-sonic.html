Sega announced the development of a next-generation game in the Sonic series. Sega described it as a "re-invention" of the classic franchise.  The title is currently scheduled to release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 during 2006. A Revolution version is expected as well.

Yuji Naka will produce the title and character designer Naoto Ohshima, who created the original Sonic game for the Sega Genesis in 1991, will also contribute to the game's development. According to Sega, the developers will "create the most intense sensation of speed ever experienced in videogames" with "an innovative combination of art, physics and game design."<br>

"We are proud to re-create our famous friend, Sonic, for a new generation of gamers on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360," said Naka. "With Sonic the Hedgehog, we have gone back to our starting point, more than 15 years ago, to reinvent the attitude and speed that made our hero a legend. The 'rebirth of Sonic' will offer an unparalleled sense of speed that is only possible using the processing power afforded by the new systems."
