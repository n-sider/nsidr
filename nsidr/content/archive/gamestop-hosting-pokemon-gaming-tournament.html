To participate, gamers must bring their own Nintendo DS and <i>Pokemon Diamond</i> or <i>Pearl</i> game cartridge. Anyone wishing to participate is encouraged to contact their local store to confirm the exact time that the tournament will start. A "Store Locator" can be found on the stores' websites (either <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/">here</a>) to find a nearby location.<br />

Pokemon Battle Revolution for the Nintendo Wii features the first Wii-to-DS linked game play. Players can use the Pokemon developed in Diamond and Pearl to battle against four other players in the DS Battle Mode.
