<p>The most recent issue of Japanese publication V-Jump indicates that the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series established on the Sony PlayStation 2 will also make an appearance on Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed Revolution.  Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi is developed by Spike and published under Atari.  No details were included besides the standard line of the game taking advantage of the controller's unique motion-sensing technology.  It will, however, be interesting to see how the studio applies the controller to a fighting game.</p>

<p>The Dragon Ball animated television show by artist Akira Toriyama spawned the popular series of cel-shaded fighting games of which Tenkaichi is the latest.  The first was released in October 2005 for PlayStation 2 and achieved an average review ranking of 69 percent according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/928096.asp?q=dragon%20ball%20z">GameRankings.com</a> (based on 29 reviews).</p>
