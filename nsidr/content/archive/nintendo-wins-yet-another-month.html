The NPD numbers for June (tracking sales of game hardware and the games that run on them) have been released, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2868">as is their wont</a>, Nintendo has put out a number of "we're #1" facts to go with.<br />
<br />
For June, DS tops the charts again with 605,000 units sold across North America, with 562,000 of these in the U.S. and Canada making up the rest.  Wii is second with 435,000 units continent-wide; 381,800 of these are chalked up to U.S. sales.  Nintendo reckons 2007 Wii  sales stand now at 2.3 million for the continent, with 2.1 million of these in the U.S.<br />
<br />
On the software front, June saw Nintendo capturing six of the top ten software slots, including all four of the front-runners with <i>Mario Party 8</i>, <i>Wii Play</i>, <i>Pok&eacute;mon Diamond</i>, and <i>Pok&eacute;mon Pearl</i>.  With the sales they've seen, NIntendo claims the top software publisher spot for both June and the entirety of 2007, with 15 out of 30 of the top sellers in 2007 Nintendo titles, and the top three owned by Nintendo&mdash;Diamond, Wii Play, and Pearl.<br />
<br />
Wii's retail software library is over 60-strong, brought up to over 180 if you include Virtual Console titles.  Nintendo expects 330 titles in total by year's end, including 100 titles from "every major third-party publisher" and 50 new titles for the Virtual Console service.  Nintendo DS's library is approximately 300-strong and 140 are expected to join that number by the end of the year.
