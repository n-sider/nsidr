Nintendo exec shrugs off Sony's talk </a></font><br>
The last few weeks have been fairly slow. The passing of E3 has dulled much of the discussion and the 

prospect of summertime has relaxed restless minds.  Nevertheless, we'll start out with a piece that 

highlights the trials and tribulations of being Nintendo.  While it may be a bit old, here's an 

interview conducted with Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, during the past E3.  The interview reveals 

Nintendo's mission for the coming year.  Will the future work into Nintendo's favor?  ...or will a 

dismal reception to connectivity be yet another slap in the face?

<p><font size="2"><a href="http://www.gamerfeed.com/index.php?story=3547">Rumor: Nintendo and 

Microsoft to Partner?</a></font><br>
Speaking of a slap in the face, where'd this outrageous <i>"Nintendo rumor of the week"</i> come from? Nintendo and Microsoft to become allies?  Speculation is all fun and games until I poke your eye out. While the chances of such an event happening are not impossible, the fact that it comes from a website called Sp0ng makes one suspicious or possibly giggle.  Either way, the prospect of such an 

event - Nintensoft GameBox (a plush toiletry item?) - is an interesting thought.

<p><font size="2"><a href="http://www.gamerfeed.com/index.php?ftrid=110">GBA vs PSP</a></font><br>
Although this topic has already been traversed and dissected one too many times - despite no new 

information since E3 - here's yet another look at the Nintendo GBA vs Sony PSP.  Is Nintendo's fallout 

in the console market a sign of what's to come in the handheld arena?  No one really knows, but 

everyone is happy to offer their opinion on the matter.

Art?</a></font><br>
Are video games art?  That's the question the author of this article poses.  He also examines 

the seriousness of such a revolution.  Here's a quote from the article.  "First, developers need to 

stand up as artists and continue to envision and create new possibilities of expression with 

videogames. Second, gamers need to see videogames as more than time-wasting stress-relieving outlets 

and appreciate the efforts of revolutionary developers like UGA and titles like Rez.  Until 

developers and gamers expect more of themselves and of videogames, the financers and publishers of 

videogames will continue to clone the latest proven bestseller rather than innovate new ways to 

challenge gamers intellectually and emotionally."  Deep stuff.

g Video Games In Germany is Feat of Skill</a></font><br>
Germany is at war with robots.  According to this article, Germany has spent five decades developing 

one of the world's strictest decency standards for books, comics, movies, music and games. For example, if a game features blood splatterings (paper cuts?), decapitations or death cries, it runs the risk of being placed on a government list known as "the index". Being 

indexed means it can't be sold to anyone under 18, displayed in stores or advertised on television, 

in newspapers and in most magazines.  Bah.
