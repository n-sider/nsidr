<p>The anticipation for this title has escalated into a feverish pitch. Early on in its development we were notified that Namco was handling the project. More specifically, we were told that Namcos Ace Combat team was on the scene. The most recent rumblings however, were that the team was actually comprised of part of the Ace Combat team since some were coming and going throughout the development. The Ace Combat series is no slouch when it comes to tactical air combat simulation. It is considered by many to be one of the few fun flying simulation games on the market. Namcos team has shown their prowess on this front numerous times now and is even prepping Ace Combat 5 for release this fall on the PlayStation 2.</p>

<p>What does this mean for Nintendo and Starfox? It means the game should be in good hands. Last years E3 play test showed an extremely early demo of the game that many said was early enough it should not have been shown. This year, however, is a completely different ball game. The title was designed to have a strong focus on the multiplayer mode with the ability to man vehicles or go it on foot. No matter what anybodys opinion on last years early showing was, they could almost all agree on one thing: the multiplayer aspect has amazing potential. Being able to soar way up high while your friends are far below scurrying like ants is something of a dream game on paper for some.</p>

<p>We plan on running this game through the ropes at the expo. Needless to say, many of us are excited to finally play a proper version of a beloved franchise. Prepare for launch</p>

<p><center><font size=3><b>Geist</b></font></center></p>

<p><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/features-042804-pree305.jpg"></center></p>

<p>GameCube owners have been screaming for a good first-person shooter, one to compete with Halo. Geist not only has the potential to be great but also to also set a standard for innovation in future games. Players will take the form of a geist - German for a ghost or spirit. The geist will allow players to advance through the game by virtually entering the bodies of other characters and taking advantage of their physical and mental abilities.</p>

<p>As you progress in the game you will need to possess more than a dozen unique character types - using their weapons, equipment, skills, and even memories - to complete your objectives. Possessions range from soldiers with guns to dogs and even mice. Animals are able to assist the player by performing specialized physical tasks. The game will give players the chance to "choose different characters and see the world in different ways". Keep an eye on this game. I assure you, it's worth it.</p>

<p>The word we've been hearing is that Geist looks really different in its current version. We expect an extremely polished demo for the show. We also hope to finally get a firm hold on the multiplayer capabilities in store. Does the multiplayer play like the single player mode with players jumping in and out of bodies to hide? Hopefully all this will be answered at the show and then some.</p>

<p><center><font size=3><b> The Legend of Zelda: Next</b></font></center></p>

<p><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/features-042804-pree306.jpg"></center></p>

<p>As you might have guessed, this one almost goes without saying. To many, <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> was last years big title and a memorable one at that. Now that Zelda-master Eiji Aonuma is in a producing role, we will have to see what kind of magic they can produce with fresh blood on the scene. You can expect an interesting mlange of new and old into this melting pot of gaming goodness. Mr. Aonuma also gave us the acclaimed <i>Majoras Mask</i> on the Nintendo 64. Like Majoras Mask, the next game in the series will build off its predecessors core game engine. In essence, the game will be taking the backbone of The Wind Waker to use what already works well and instead concentrate on creating a polished game world. This doesnt mean that there wont be large differences between the two games, even in the visual department. In fact, having the engine in place is a great way to mix up the artistic side of the game without having to worry about the technology that will support it.</p>

<p>Just recently we heard that the game has a great chance of being playable at the show. This took many of us by surprise, as we assumed it would only make an appearance on video reel. We are not 100% sure that this will be the case though, which means we're keeping expectations balanced. Either way, I'm sure we'll be happy that it shows up in some form or another. As a series, Zelda has an air of wonder and power that can shake us up on almost every showing. This E3, in particular, should be no exception in that regard.</p>

<p><center><font size=3><b>Paper Mario 2</b></font></center></p>

<p><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/features-042804-pree302.jpg"></center></p>

<p>We saw the first Paper Mario during the final days of gaming prosperity on the Nintendo 64. Truth be told, it was the final true Nintendo game I played on the console before inevitably storing the 64 and my dozen or so games in the closet next to my Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures.</p>

<p>Despite much of the Nintendo 64 userbase having already moved onto the next-generation of consoles, Paper Mario still managed to sell over a million units worldwide. And most recently, during winter 2003, Nintendo released <i>Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga</i>, which has since received a warm reception in retail from Game Boy Advance owners.</p>

<p>With the success of prior titles, Nintendo is prepared to introduce Paper Mario 2 to the Nintendo GameCube. The game is assumed to use the standard RPG-action formula introduced in former titles, where players can simultaneously perform moves in realtime and via a standard menu. We actually know nothing about the gameplay...however the graphics sure do look pretty. E3 will no doubt reveal more...</p>
