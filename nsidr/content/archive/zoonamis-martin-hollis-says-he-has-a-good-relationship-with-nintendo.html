<p>In a follow-up to the announcement of the multiplatform music-mix game <I>Funkydilla</I>, IGNCube conducted an interview with Zoonamis Martin Hollis to ask about his relationship with Nintendo.</p>

<p>"We've got an excellent relationship with Nintendo," he responded.  "It stretches back many years from Rare and Goldeneye and it continued through my time in the US and through to today. It's partly based on a mutual respect. Nintendo is always software publisher of the year for me. I guess that's all I can really say about that and I'm sorry I'm not able to say more."</p>

<p>Hollis relationship with Nintendo began while working at Rare as the producer and director of Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark. He was later hired to work at Nintendo Technology Development during the hardware development of the Nintendo GameCube.  Shortly thereafter, in his search for new challenges, he founded Zoonami.</p>

<p>When questioned about any other future titles besides <I>Funkydilla</I>, Hollis declined to comment saying that the projects are too far into the future for there to be any value in revealing them now.</p>
