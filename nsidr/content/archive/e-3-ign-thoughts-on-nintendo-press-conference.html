<p>IGN.com has posted impressions of the Nintendo press conference that took place earlier today.  An excerpt is below, while the full article can be read <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/706/706546p1.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>"...I have to say, though, for as stupid as the Wii Sports games look, they are at least fun. And meanwhile, Metroid Prime 3 could be super-awesome. Zelda is sure to be the greatest Link adventure of all time. And Mario Galaxy, to me, looks totally and completely amazing, which is why I'm so peeved that Nintendo didn't show it off in detail. And speaking of that, we saw titles like Pilot Wings pop up on the screen and then disappear in a flash, never to be seen or referenced again during the media briefing. Project H.A.M.M.E.R? Looks very promising. I wanted to see more, but I never did. Disaster: Day of Crisis looked very sweet, but again, I left he briefing wondering what to really expect from the game.</p>

<p>By the way, if you watched the conference from the comfort of your home and not live from the Kodak Theatre, you might consider yourself lucky. Nintendo's standard resolution games were blown up and pixilated on giant projector screens, and as a result they looked visually worse than they actually are, which is very unfortunate. I saw a lot of people around me scoffing at some of the graphics in, say, Metroid Prime 3, and I kept fighting the urge to turn to them and argue, "No, no, seriously, don't worry. I've played it and it looks much better than it does on this giant screen." Overblown and pixilated, the Wii Sports titles looked like DS demos. Youch...."</p>
