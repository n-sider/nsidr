<p><b style="font-size: 20px">Now Playing:  Okay, Maybe it is Dead</b><br><i>Column by N-Sider Staff</i>

<p><b>Edition: 11-22-2005</b>


<p>What you are about to read is a column the N-Sider staff discusses memorable game experiences (good or bad). This is not an article of mini-previews, nor is it to be taken seriously as any form of review. In this section, our staffers have the freedom to discuss whatever their gaming hearts desire in a relatively compact fashion. The games discussed are not limited to Nintendo published titles, nor are they even limited to Nintendo systems. Everyone on this staff is a gamer at heart and a great game is still a great game, even when published on another platform.

<p>Both of my (Jeff) entries into this edition will be rather short. We are currently considering ways to reinvigorate reader and staff interest in this column. If any of you prefer my shorter and more direct entries, send in a letter to the mailbag (<a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>. In fact, any ideas you guys have, or feedback to the site in general, should always be directed there.

<p><b>Game:</b> Geist<br>
<b>Platform:</b> GameCube

<p>I dont like Geist. I purchased the game for $50 and consider it one of the worst decisions of my modern game buying life. Like most of you, I knew Geist wouldnt be the totally awesome game I had once envisioned, but, be it from all the n-Space coverage Ive edited or simply stupidity, I thought it might be worth playing. I wish to god I had bought Pikmin 2 instead. But as Alanis Morissette says: you live, you learn.

<p>For a Nintendo published and funded game, the control is remarkably subpar and loose. That was really the first and last strike. Perhaps Im spoiled by by other titles, but control in a first-person shooter is absolutely critical to my enjoyment. In Geist you play as a ghost and have to inhabit objects to scare people, so you can inhabit them. Thats its little unique feature. While the actual inhabiting of different objects and use of them is very simple and fun, the linearity of the game prevents the feature from really being used fully. You can only scare fictional guard A if you inhabit trash can B. Trying to scare guard A by say inhabiting another guard (guard C) and pointing a gun at Anot going to work. It isnt in the storybook. I also found the story itself to be rather generic.

<p>I did like the fact that Geist featured some voice acting, though it was no Eternal Darkness. Hopefully future Nintendo titles will keep this trend going.

<p>So yeah, you can rent this one if you want, but the multiplayer modes are unpolished and boring. They reminded me of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes multiplayer offerings, except with no bounty hunters or cool Metroid guns/cannons. Oh, and no morphball. Yeahkind of need a Chozo armor suit to pull that off.


<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> Beyond Good & Evil <b>| Platform:</b> GameCube</p>

<p>I may have hated Geist, but I duped Brandon into trading it for Beyond Good & Evil. I have totally redeemed myself. BG&E is incredible.

<p>The game is a perfect mix between The Legend of Zelda and Metroid Prime. The adventure style, combat, automated jumping, and puzzles were all very reminiscent of Links 3D outings, but with an added Metroid Prime staple. You have a camera that is needed to scan creatures, maps, and other important objects. You go into a first-person view to use it. Taking quality photographs of the different species in the game is your primary source of income as well.

<p>The game is also broken up by many hovercraft sections, which control well and are a fun diversion. The hovercraft is your main mode of transportation, much like Links sailboat in Wind Waker.

<p>Id say that the games storyline is its strongest asset. Though I havent yet completed the adventure, I feel very engaged in what has happened, interested in whats to come, and even genuinely moved by the story, at times. It has great voice acting as well. Definitely find a way to play this game.

<p>The experience has left me very interested in King Kong, the upcoming game from Ubisoft and Michael Ancels team (Ancel was behind Rayman and BG&E). Ill report on that one come December.

<p><b>Game:</b> Riviera: The Promised Land<br>
<b>Platform:</b> Game Boy Advance


<p>Riviera, a unique RPG developed by Sting and published in the States by Atlus, first caught my eye in Nintendo Power's Game Watch some months ago. I really wasn't sure what to think about it at the time, besides noting that it looked pretty. Instead, I mentally filed the title away for future reference. After a recommendation from a friend and hearing about its cult hit status in Japan, I eventually got my hands on the game. Its actually quite an intriguing take on the role-playing genre and a lot of fun.

<p>For the uninitiated, Riviera tosses out a lot of the things that define modern RPGs. There is no more walking around fields hitting "A" to open chests, talking to bystanders, low HP (health points), ailments, death, (your characters are resurrected in-between battles) and the game doesnt use a traditional experience system. In its place is a streamlined system; one that both gives the story plenty of room to carry itself without tedious interruption, and makes me not just want to win battles, but win them well, in order to experience more of my surroundings in the game.

<p>One thing I've found particularly impressive is how captivating the story is. It and the game mechanics are intertwined well. The plot revolves around a demon infestation in the land of Riviera and the Asgard gods' quest to stop it. The excellent localization and editing contributes to this, but what's especially interesting is how my characters' statistics are affected by what I choose to do in the game. For example, certain actions that result in injury such as a fall, or getting hit by a trapped chest will result in that character's max HP dropping; other actions will find characters acquiring permanent bonuses.

<p>Nothing is perfect, and Riviera certainly is not nothing. The game offers a nice perfect-for-portable-play suspend option that can even be used in the middle of a battle, but it cannot be used until the sometimes lengthy cutscene-style dialogue and animation sequences complete. I'm also quite the packrat, and Riviera has a painfully low limit on carried items. The "inventory full" buzzer sound, I dread, will be forever cemented in my mind, especially as most enemies drop items.

<p>I haven't had much time to dedicate to Riviera yet; the game clock says I'm just under eight hours in, but I've greatly enjoyed what I've played of the game quite a bit. Hopefully my Nintendogs won't be minding the chronic neglect over the next few weeks.


<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> Daigasso! Band Brothers (& Request Selection) <br><b>Platform:</b> Nintendo DS</p>


<p>Ah, my first import, and my most intense DS flame. This is not just a music game; this is the Nintendo DS transformed, literally, into a musical instrument. A limited one, to be sure, but the feeling is unquestionable.

<p>How Band Brothers achieves this is actually pretty simple: a scale is laid out across the D-pad and buttons, and in Pro mode, the triggers add sharps and octave transformations (in Amateur mode, the game plays these for you). The included songs aren't recordings, they're full arrangements made specifically for the game, and every last note in each song can be played by the player. You don't just tap the note to score; you must hold it throughout its duration. It adds up to an immersive playing experience just not matched by typical "hit it now" rhythm games.

<p>Nintendo recently offered a special Option Pak titled Request Selection that adds new songs to the title. I snagged this fully expecting a rekindling of my Band Brothers love, but I'm left with a slightly empty feeling. The arrangements aren't quite to the level of the original set of songs, though by and large they are certainly better than the amateur stuff I've picked up off the Internet. No big deal, they're still fun to play -- my real problem is that the scores you get playing Request Selection songs in Single Play aren't saved. How am I supposed to challenge myself without saved scores?

<p>Band Brothers is well-known for its Band Play mode; up to eight people can play through any song in the game (including the Request Selection songs) off one card. I regret that I really haven't had a chance to experience this mode. I've tried it with my wife and a coworker, but neither really got into it like I have.

<p>Despite the complaints about the above modes, I can't recall a title that has lasted quite so long -- probably due largely to the presence of the onboard music editor, which I've spent countless hours with. Although I can't in good faith recommend Request Selection, you're selling your DS short if you don't have Band Brothers in your collection.


<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> Osu! Tatakae! Quendan! <b>| Platform:</b> Nintendo DS</p>

<p>If Band Brothers is about playing a musical instrument through the DS's buttons, Ouendan is about dancing with your stylus on the touch screen. No DS-arranged music here; this is full-up digitized music that sounds great through headphones, with often hilarious and sometimes touching animated manga scenes to go with your performance.

<p>The premise -- helping three black-suited manly cheerleader-superheroes do a dance routine to help people in need -- may be preposterously silly, but that's okay; several of the mangas are considerably more so. I can't remember the last time I've laughed so hard at a game. Beyond the humor, the presentation is absolutely top-notch; the manga artwork is excellent and set very skillfully to the music.

<p>In the beginning (and I highly recommend you start on Easy mode), it's very easy to become entranced tapping away at the targets and sliding over the paths to the beat. As I've progressed, the game has gradually thrown more at me, from bouncing paths to stacked hits and probably more I've not seen yet, ramping up the challenge level to what seems insane at first but with practice just flows from my hand. It's an incredible experience.

<p>I'd been holding off on Ouendan for some time, intending to get it at the same time as Request Selection to save on shipping. Now that I've had several days with it, I have to say that even without Request Selection's less-than-stellar showing, Ouendan would have been a great purchase even on its own.

<p>Highly recommended. Just make sure you realize that the blue button that appears in the lower-left after a song reads "Replay", and not "Try Again"... unless you're willing to drive yourself crazy trying to figure out why you seem to be screwing up in the exact same place every time you retry a song.

<p><b>Game:</b> Osu! Tatakae! Quendan!<br>
<b>Platform:</b> Nintendo DS


<p>At exactly 9:13 a.m on Friday the 26th August 2005, a DHL deliveryman showed up on our doorstep holding a package. My mother answered the door and signed for said package. By 11 a.m that day, I knew she'd signed for it (Thank you 'Online Tracking'.). And I got really nervous: my mother was not supposed to know I'd ordered games off the Internet. And worse, I used my dads credit card. So it's no suprise that she confiscated the games. It took me a week of begging and fervent maths study in order to actually procure the games. In a way this was good, as it meant that I was literally foaming at the mouth when the games landed in my hands. Less than ten seconds later, I was booting up a game called Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan.

<p>The basic premise of Ouendan is that in Japan, many people are sad. It could be anything from matters of the heart to undying stress. These people, when reaching their wits end will shout out 'OUENDAN!'. As the Ouendan cheering squad, you will arrive on the scene and do all sorts of manly poses to help cheer up your fellow citizens. Oh, and these men also wear black trench coats.

<p>I immediately drew parallels to my own life. I enjoy cheering people up. I have a penchant for trench coats. It was like this game was made for my eyes only. I guess that's not all that far from the truth: Ouendan has sold fairly poorly in Japan to this date. If this game was made for my eyes only though, then someone out there must really love me because Ouendan is one hell of a game.

<p>Ouendan is a rhythm game, in case you didn't know. However, it's a refreshing change from what we've been seeing as of late, i.e. DDR knockoffs. The gameplay mechanics of Ouendan are like this: There is a circle on-screen, with a ring around it. That ring contracts, and when it makes contact with the circle, you touch the circle with your stylus. It sounds simple, and in many ways it is, but it's the implementation that makes it work. The ring contraction speeds change, placement can be very frustrating, and then they throw in other mechanics on top of that, such as tracing lines. It all flows quite well, and is integrated rather seamlessly into the songs it works with.

<p>The songs also are quite good, assuming you're into J-Pop/J-Rock. If you're not, then I guess you could always turn the volume down. But that would defeat the purpose of the game. Most of the songs themselves are popular, and have generally done well in the Japanese charts. There aint no cheap crap here...well, I guess there is. While definitely good quality J-Pop/J-Rock, all the tracks are played by sound-alikes. This might not be to everyones liking, but for the most part they're pretty faithful to the originals and I still enjoyed them equally (except for 'Ready, Steady, Go!'. What happened there?). However, the big thing about the soundtrack is that it uses <b>actual mp3s</b>. That's right, Ouendan does away with the MIDI tracks found on Daigasso! Band Brothers and uses full mp3 audio. Low bitrates to be sure, but the fact that they used a cartridge with that much storage space alone tells you a lot of effort went into this game.

<p>The humor as well is quite amusing, and I don't even know Japanese. Luckily though, all of the storylines are presented in a highly visual manga panel format, meaning you know exactly what's going on with each character, and for the most part its easy to comprehend. One of the introductions has a cat walking into a man's restaurant and urinating on the carpet. I laughed so hard, I almost did the same thing...I probably shouldn't have written that.

<p>The only problem I really have with it is the lack of DS Download Play. Both players need to own the cartridge to play the game. True, it'd be difficult to fit a version of the game into the small 4MB of RAM on the DS, but I'm sure iNiS could have found a way to do it. Ah well, it can't be helped. I guess the incredible single-player mode will have to tide me over.

<p>To end this, Ouendan is a game worthy of attention from any rhythm game fan. (If you know iNiS, you'll also know they made the acclaimed Gitaroo Man for PS2.) But even if you're not into the genre, I'm sure this may change your mind just a little. This was the first rhythm game I actually bought: the only reason I got it was for the off-the-wall premise. But it's grown on me, and now I'm planning to pick up many other rhythm games, such as Daigasso! Band Brothers and Amplitude. If you play this game, you'll most likely agree.

<p><b>Game:</b> Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2<br>
<b>Platform:</b> Game Boy Advance

<p>I finally beat it. I know Im about 14 years late. But you know the saying: better late than never. Of course I played it on the Super Nintendo but since I never owned it, I never got around to beating it. I know what youre going to sayhow could I own an SNES and not SMW? I didnt know better when it came to games. I wasnt informed. My parents got me a used SNES from a family member and got me games they thought Id like. Seriously, the best games I had were Pool and Tennis. I missed out on a lot.

<p>But thank goodness for the GBA and filling in some of those empty spaces in my heart from the 16-bit era. So, when SMW came out for the GBA I picked it up right away. But halfway through it got ignored due to other games. It was until recently that I picked it up once more and played it on that wonderful device known as the DS. One thing I found out about SMW this second time around was that some of those Extra levels were challenging, especially Tubular. I thought Id never be able to pass it.

<p>Playing this game reminds me of how I missed the days of the Super Nintendo and particularly side-scrollers. I know that with the release of the New Super Mario Bros. game for the DS many fans wishes of a new traditional Mario game will be fulfilled, myself included. But, I just really, really, really wished that Nintendo would have used sprites, which would have made the game not only look way better but also give it that flair from the past. Of course, not everything is about graphics, Im sure the game is going to be a blast nevertheless.


<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap <b>| Platform:</b> Game Boy Advance</p>

<p>Short and sweet, thats what The Minish Cap can be summed up to. But because its overflowing with pixel eye candy that more than makes up for its shortness. I personally think that the Wind Waker style works amazingly well for the GBA. I really hope this isnt the last handheld Zelda that uses sprites or the Wind Waker style. Theres something that the handheld Zelda games have that I enjoy that its console counterparts lack. I cant quite put my finger on it, and it isnt the sprites.

<p>What I enjoyed the most about The Minish Cap was the back story on Vaati. Up to his point, we knew next to nothing about the Four Swords villain. Another thing I found very amusing was that the game actually revealed why we find rupees in the grass.

<p>Wouldnt it be awesome if Nintendo decided to update the original Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Links Awakening and the Oracles of Ages/Seasons with The Minish Cap graphics and improved menus and whatnot? I knowI might as well keep dreaming.


<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> SSX3: Out of Bounds <b>| Platform:</b> GameCube</p>

<p>I think SSX Tricky is my second most-played game for the GameCube, Super Smash Bros. Melee being the first, of course. And SSX3 is starting to catch up.

<p>Ive highly enjoyed the last two installments to the SSX franchise (never played the original though) and with the release of a fourth installment to the series, SSX On Tour, I felt like playing SSX3 once more. Im just about finished maxing out all the characters stats, which is pretty easy. The hard part is getting platinum medals. Getting them in races isnt very hard. Getting them in freestyle events is a whole other story. I have yet to get a single platinum medal.

<p>Heres to shredding the slopes with my favorite Italian plumbers later his month!


<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> Katamari Damacy <b>| Platform:</b> PlayStation 2</p>

<p>This game is the sole reason why I purchased a PS2 recently. This game is waaaay out there, quite unique, and extremely enjoyable. Over the past year Id heard that the game was really fun, even addictive. But I just never had the opportunity to play it until recently and once I did, I knew I had to own it.

<p>Who would have thought that rolling a ball (the Katamari) around to gather various things that range from household items, to buildings and cars, to giant octopi, and continents could be fun? Not me at least.

<p>For those that dont know the plot of the game, its quite simple. The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroys all the stars in the sky, and its up to his tiny son, the prince, to gather as many things as he can on Earth to replace the now destroyed stars.

<p>Not only is the gameplay addictive, but the songs as well, especially the one during the intro which I found myself whistling far too often.

<p>And speaking of the intro, itll make you raise an eyebrow when first seen, but youll grow to love it. I guess the same basically applies to the game in general.




<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; border-top: 1px solid grey;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/avatars/Colin_Castro1.jpg" align="left" style="padding: 4px 4px 4px 0px">Colin Castro</p>

<p><b>Game:</b> Trace Memory<br>
<b>Platform:</b> Nintendo DS

<p>Ever since I first heard about Trace Memory earlier this year, Ive been eagerly awaiting its release. The whole premise and play style of the game reminded me of point-and-click adventures of old such as The Dig and Full Throttle, two games that happen to be some of my all time favorites. Sadly this genre seems to have been forgotten, with few recent additions (Still Life comes to mind). But thanks to CiNG and Nintendo, I now have a worthy point-and-click type adventure to take on the road with me.

<p>The game opens up with Ashley, the protagonist, riding a boat on its way to Blood Edward Island. Its the day before Ashleys 14th birthday, and she has just found out that her father is still alive. Her whole life Ashley had been lead to believe that her father was dead, mostly by his sister Jessica, who also is the one who raised her. One of the first actions that you must complete while on the boat is a discussion with Jessica, which is a perfect way to introduce you to a very important piece of Trace Memory; conversations.

<p>In order to enjoy this game to its fullest, you must understand one important concept. This is an investigative game, where you must use your brain to solve problems rather than brute force. You must gather clues from your surroundings, from Ashleys inner musings, and from the numerous conversations that you will have throughout the game. Now, I purposely blacked myself out from any information regarding the content of Trace Memory because I wanted everything to be a surprise to me. And for that I am thankful, for I feel it increased my enjoyment of the game itself. With this in mind Im not going to mention anything about what happens in the game other than the initial boat ride.

<p>Rather, I will discuss the aspects of the game that I enjoyed. The big plus of the game is the ability to do everything you need to with the stylus alone. It provides that extra level of precision and speed that is greatly appreciated when trying to solve some of the numerous puzzles in the game. Even movement is simpler with the mouse, making it easier to move around from room to room.

<p>But what has truly engrossed me in this game over the past week is the story. Never mind the simplicity of the dialogue; it still is an intriguing tale of two characters and a mansion. And the simplistic conversations actually provide some extra humor to the game. I love the fact that hints and solutions to puzzles are derived from the conversations that take place during the course of the game. Even the story itself is fleshed out through dialogue between the characters. But the story is also told through items found throughout the game, which makes you want to search and examine every nook and cranny of the mansion.

<p>When its all said and done, Trace Memory has some flaws (not being able to pick up obvious items until you actually need them is frustrating) but its still a solid purchase for your Nintendo DS. This game will occupy my DS slot for a long time. Forget Nintendogs and Advance Wars: Duel Strike. Give me more games like Trace Memory.



<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; border-top: 1px solid grey;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/avatars/Dan_Cronkhite1.jpg" align="left" style="padding: 4px 4px 4px 0px">Dan Cronkhite</p>

<p><b>Game:</b> Age of Empires<br>
<b>Platform:</b> PC


<p>Its strange that of all the computer games I have purchased, Age of Empires, the first one, has become not only one of the most played games in my household, but also the longest lasting game in my library. Sure, I own Warcraft III, Age of Empires II, Starcraft, and Diablo 1 & 2. Sure, my sisters and mother cant get enough of The Sims and RollerCoaster Tycoon. Sure, the game has its faults, and some may say playing it is a kick in the face to everyone that hates our ever-present monopolistic nemesis. Still, the fact is, no other game has been able to captivate me, and my dad even more so, than this gem from Ensemble Studios and Microsoft.

<p>That right there is probably why Im so thankful for it. My dad loves the game, and plays it much more than I could ever have time to. I download new scenarios, and create my own scenarios, just so he can play them and still feel challenged after all these years. There are still over a dozen scenarios on my computer that I havent had time to touch, and yet Im so grateful for having them. The reason? This game, more than any other thing in the known universe, has been able to bring my father and I closer together.

<p>My father and I hadnt really gotten along in a while, and we didnt talk much. There always seemed to be something more important going on than strengthening our relationship. That changed when we got this game, and it drew him in like no hobby ever had before. His first PC game was Dungeon Keeper, and that right there is an amazing and innovative game in its own right (the subject for a future Now Playing from me for sure), but Age of Empires simplified what needed to be simplified, fleshed out what needed to be fleshed out, and also had the ability to appeal to my dads history buff side. Historical fiction is his favorite genre of everything  books, films, T.V. shows, and now computer games.

<p>Age of Empires embraces history like few games can. It tells the stories of dozens of ancient civilizations, and lets you be a part of those stories. It is YOU who conquers the African jungle, YOU who leads Israel out of Egypt, YOU who brings Alexanders armies through Europe and Asia, and YOU who discovers the ancient Siberia/Alaska land bridge and populates the entirety of the Americas with thousands of cultures. With a well-balanced classic RTS system, and enough deep customization options for telling your own stories, its a top of the line strategy game deserving of all the praise it gets.

<p>It has also given my father and I a common hobby -- something we can talk and compare notes about, challenge each other with, and explore our creativity together with.

<p>This may be the only time youll see me write this: Thank you Microsoft, for this wonderful game which my family will cherish for years.


<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> Tetris <b>| Platform:</b> Mobile Phone</p>

<p>I bought a new cell phone last month. The moment I learned how to go online with it, the first thing I did was buy Tetris for $5.00 plus a fifty cent download fee. Best $5.50 I ever spent. Ive been playing it everywhere and any-which-way -- at work, on the bus, at school, at home, in bed, with my girlfriend, in my girlfriends bed, at my grandmas house, with my grandma, with my mother, with my cat, with my eyes closed, with my nerves shot, with my sweat making the phone too slippery to hold, with my phone battery dying, with my uncle dying okay maybe not the last one. But darn near any other free moment of my day.

<p>Tetris, in my eyes, is the definition of the perfect game. It can be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike, its structure is purely mathematical and logical, you can always improve, and it can be played for any length of time whatsoever. My version comes with three modes -- Marathon (classic endless Tetris from Level 1 to Level 15), 40 Lines (Race to clear 40 Lines with the best score and fastest time possible), and Ultra (most number of lines and highest score in three minutes).

<p>Maybe I should explain what it is, for those of you who are turning seven this year and just learned to not jerk the controller around everywhere in order to move your character (get ready to un-learn that for next year!). Tetris is a puzzle game. In fact, it is synonymous with puzzle games themselves. Blocks made up of four squares in different combinations fall from the top of the screen, and you have to rotate them so they fit into even rows with no empty space. Every time you make a row, it disappears so that your stack of blocks never hits the ceiling. Of course -- never just means until you learn that the long, blue, straight line block isnt going to come in time.

<p>Not only is this the perfect game, but it is expected to be perfect! One of the only games in existence where the slightest glitch or mistake by a programmer will bring a review score from a perfect score to a 1 or 2 out of 10. If only racing games and platformers were held to the same standard! Basically, in about two weeks, you can learn to make this game yourself, so no development house worth their salt is going to release a substandard version of the game.

<p>If you havent played it -- download it for your phone right now, or buy it for whatever handheld or console you want. If you havent played it in a while, its time to revisit an old friend.




<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid grey;"><b>Game:</b> Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past <b>| Platform:</b> Game Boy Advance</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda raises the bar for adventure games upon each release of the series. Whether for a console, a handheld, or a lunch box -- if you see the Zelda name, and the word Philips is nowhere to be seen, you know youre picking up a quality product. In no case is this truer than Zelda 3 for the SNES.

<p>This is the game that gave us most of the traditions were used to in Zelda games, or even in video games themselves. Parallel worlds -- one light, one dark, a mysterious, magical sword of legend hidden in the forest, a hidden danger on Death Mountain, missing girls used by evil forces to release a monster from its prison, a soldier comically flailing around in the air before plummeting into a pit. Its all here, ready to be experienced for the first time, again and again.

<p>Ive beaten the game over twenty times. Sometimes I try to do it as fast as I can. Sometimes I try to do it with the least amount of heart containers possible. Sometimes I try to find every little thing in the game. The most recent time I played, I realized after all this time, that there were still things I didnt know about yet. For instance -- I didnt know that if you sprinkled magic powder on the lady sweeping in front of her house in Kakariko Village, she turns into a fairy, and that this action changes the ending scene of the game! Maybe some of you knew that already, but I found it purely by accident, after thinking for years that I had done all there is to do in the game. Another thing I found out about for the first time was the Magic Boomerang upgrade you get by tossing your normal Boomerang into a fairys wishing well. Again, might have been obvious to some people, but I got the game in 1994, and in 2005 I am just discovering this! It really makes me wonder what else I was missing!

<p>Exploration is the main focus of the game. There are many items that you can find that give you an advantage, but that arent necessary to complete the game. This style of play is refreshing after so many platformers and adventure games forcing you to rely on every item in the game for the area you found that item in.
