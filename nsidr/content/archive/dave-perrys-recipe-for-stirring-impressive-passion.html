Most recently famous for the idea that gamers will jump the Wii ship in years to come because of the graphical power gap vs. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Shiny's Dave Perry gave a followup interview in Disposable Media's issue 9 (the original comments sourcing from issue 8) bemoaning the negative reaction and explaining a bit more where he was coming from.<br />
<br />
"500 interviews go by without a blip, but then if you mention something negative about Nintendo, it's pretty impressive the passion that stirs," Perry says.  "Do I take my comments back? Hell no. I'm in no way a Nintendo hater. I have a Wii, I bought it the second it came out, I play it often. I've got all their machines and tons of games. There's just many issues with the Wii, and the fans just don't want to hear it. I personally admire how well the Wii has done. I just find it interesting to see how people turn a blind eye to its flaws."<br />
<br />
"Games are all about accuracy," he adds. "If you request something it better happen. The Wii controller adds some slop to the system, and that in turn goes against the golden rule that controls should be tight and perfect, something that Nintendo has lived off for years. I'm surprised how unimportant these things seem to be to people, that a slight inaccuracy is acceptable."<br />
