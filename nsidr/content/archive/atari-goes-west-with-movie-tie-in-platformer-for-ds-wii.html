Atari has announced they will be bringing a new movie tie-in platformer to European DS's and Wiis.  The company describes it thusly:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">Inspired by the cucumber-cool cowboy's adventures in the comic book 'The Caravan', Lucky Luke: Go West! lets players jump into his spurred boots for a thrill-a-minute journey escorting the notorious Dalton brothers to New York to stand trial. Of course, the Daltons do what they do best â€” they escape, rob banks, wreak havoc and blow stuff up. Throw in the tenacious Lucky Luke, his faithful steed Jolly Jumper, tribes of deadly Indians, cops by the cart-load, and a vast wagon train where the Daltons mislay their ill-gotten gains and the result is a wild world of hilarious new western adventures.<br />
<br />
Play as a selection of different characters from the famous stories, including the Daltons and of course Luke himself, through the fun and colourful environments from the parched western desert to the mean streets of the Big Apple. A host of frenetic mini-games will test much more than the speed of the player's draw with chaotic shooting, drawing, steering, dancing and music games. Take on the story mode solo or invite up to 3 friends to join in for party mode mayhem and see who really does have the fastest draw in the west.</div><br />
Tate Interactive is developing the Wii (and PC) versions, and Neko the DS version.  <i>Lucky Luke: Go West</i> is slated to drop in autumn prior to the film's December release in France and elsewhere across Europe.
