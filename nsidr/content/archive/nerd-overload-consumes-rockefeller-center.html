<h2>Nerd Overload Consumes Rockefeller Center</h2>

<p>Nintendo Block Party. Considering most of the block
parties Ive attended in the past were made up of
barbecued animals and drunk people, I jumped at the
opportunity to see Nintendo add videogames to the mix
and finally secure its place within the American gaming
community.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, I now work in Midtown Manhattan and
the block party would be happening only minutes
away, and on such a gorgeous day I was happy to be
hoofing it there. I eventually found my way to
Rockefeller center and was immediately overwhelmed and
saddened; overwhelmed at how many people were swarming
the area and fighting their way to the front of lines
that seemed to go nowhere - and saddened that I didnt
see one barbecue grill anywhere. I suppose Nintendo
went the classy route by not distributing beer to the
youngsters but luckily I didnt need alcohol to loosen
me up; I would soon be drunk on Nintendo World.</p>

<p>There were four lines: one leading to the registration
booth for the <i>Donkey Konga 2</i> tourney, one leading
inside the Nintendo World store, one leading to
exclusive Pokemon downloads and the last leading
perhaps off the Brooklyn Bridge. I chose one and
stood behind a friendly, chunky young girl who went on
to her mother about all the things she was going to
buy. I am happy to say that I didnt end up inside a
Starbucks, but instead was ushered into the store
where the road to Nintendo mecca begins.</p>

<p>Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was a
gold-colored GBA and green-blue counterpart sitting
stunningly behind bulletproof glass. Okay, it probably
wasnt bulletproof, but what makes this particular
Game Boy Advance stand apart from any other is a
bonafide signature on its top from the gaming god
Shigeru Miyamoto. </p>

<p>I tackled a nearby Nintendo Store employee and asked
him what the deal was with this particular GBA and if
I heard him correctly above the joyous shrieking from
store shoppers, the Nintendo store was selling the
specially signed handhelds for $399-a-piece and the
store only had around 25-30 left in stock. I honestly
debated whether or not to whip out my credit card
right then and there and run out of the store with my
gold GBA box over my head like Link holding the
Triforce, but I had business to attend to. Also, I
didnt have $399.</p>

<p>The store is chic and shopper-friendly and, not
surprisingly, jammed wall to wall with all sorts of
Nintendo goodness from consoles to cards to Nintendo
World three-ring binders to clothing to what may have
been a loofah sponge with Luigi on it; two floors
worth of Nintendo merchandise, some of which is
exclusive only to Nintendo World. With tables
specifically made for Pokemon battles, quality
Nintendo-themed apparel, a DS play center and cashiers
who dont look like you owe them something like in
most other Manhattan shops, at least making a visit
there would be worth your while if youre ever in the
vicinity. </p>

<p>Even though the store itself exceeds expectations, the
real fun was beginning outside. High atop a black
steel tower the emcee began instructing people to
hurry and sign up for the Donkey Konga tournament, as
if the lines werent already long enough. Since
Donkey Konga makes me want to pull my hair out from
frustration (I suck), I began making my rounds, trusty
digital camera by my side, hoping I could catch a
wayward celebrity or at least a 2nd-rate celeb fresh
out of rehab.</p>

<p>A bit later, while shamelessly swiping Nintendo World
mini-bottles of water from an unattended cooler, I
thought I felt the ground begin to shake. Thats when
a group of screaming, foamy-mouthed children
clobbered me like a stampede of tiny Barcelona bulls. 
Giant, Huggable Pikachu had shuffled his way from out
of nowhere to meet and greet all of his fans, from
behind the protective fenced barrier, of course. I
was lucky enough to snap a picture of Pikachu holding
out his paw to me but a very rude woman pushed me out
of the way in the hopes that touching the mascot would
perhaps cure her eczema and maybe it did, but sadly
not even Pikachu can cure ugly.</p>

<p>After picking myself up off the ground I noticed
someone standing next to me who I thought was
accompanying Pikachu but who seemed a little bit out
of place. I was a little frightened and yet awed by a
50-year-old dressed up like a member of Team Rocket in
a blue wig carrying a plush Pikachu doll. Alright,
mostly I was just frightened. Eventually he scampered
away, but I saw Scary Pikachu Man three more times
that day skulking around the event waiting for his
chance to catch Giant Huggable Pikachu in a net and
drag him into the sewers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/2005blockparty2.jpg"></p>

<p>At one end of the event gamers delighted in playing
GameCube games on LCD screens while kids slammed
violently on bongo drums at the Donkey Konga 2
tournament. At the other end of the block I was
playing <i>Super Smash Brothers: Melee</i> from the back of
what I can only describe as the coolest vehicle ever
painted in a DS theme. Perhaps its the only vehicle
to have a DS theme, but a car you can pull over
anywhere and have a <i>Super Smash Brothers: Melee</i>
tournament in is a dream to me.</p>

<p>Just when I thought things were getting a little
boring, who should show up but your friend and mine,
Mario Mario, who I photographed staring down Pikachu
as if a real-life Smash Brothers fight was going to
break out; disappointingly, it never did. To my surprise
and horror, young poorly-paid Nintendo World staff
began peeling back the iron gates that separated the
crowd from the mascots. Honestly, I expected a
bloodbath, but a young boy about four years old ran
over to Mario with his hands outstretched and what did
our hero do? He reached down and gave the little guy
a big hug that would make even Archie Bunker weep.</p>

<p>Okay, I wept, is that what you wanted me to say?</p>

<p>Overall the opening seemed to be a rousing success as
people of all ages from all walks of life played and
had fun.  And happily for Nintendo, spent outrageous
amounts of money at the cash registers. The Nintendo World opening was hopefully a prelude to the kind of savvy attitude
Nintendo will continue as we push past E3 2005 and
beyond.</p>

<p>And if you see Scary Pikachu Man, give him my regards.  From a distance.</p>
