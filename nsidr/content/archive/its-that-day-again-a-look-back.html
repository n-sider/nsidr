April 1st is a funny time of year around N-Sider. We've always had the mandate that we won't ever fool our readers like most other sites with fake news stories appearing legit, and when it comes to the yearly site redesign, we like to keep it as blatant as possible.<br />
<br />
If you've been with us since the start, you might notice that this isn't the first time we've played the "N-Sider is closing" card, either. We did it way back in 2003 when we were but young adults writing about games in a much simpler time.<br />
<br />

In fact, we're coming up on the tenth year of N-Sider's existence, which is more than most sites can claim these days. The internet was young, and so were we.<br />
<br />
With that said, April fools is a special time around here and I thought this would be a great chance to take a look back at all of our previous April fools pranks from the last decade.<br />

I hope you've enjoyed our April Fool's sites over the years, and I hope this year's was just as entertaining. As always, you can discuss today's site in our <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?4894-N-Sider-s-April-Fools-front-page">forums</a> and let us know what you think.
