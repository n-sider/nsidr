"2006 FIFA World Cup is a perfectly playable football title that happens to include a fair amount of content for a game based on a single tournament. Gameplay still lags behind the mighty Pro Evolution Soccer in a few areas, but the 'first touch' and 'off the ball' systems continue to impress. Presentation is great as expected, making this the perfect title to celebrate the World Cup with, even if it's not the perfect footy game."

"Still, it's hard to argue that the gameplay, an obvious imitation of Winning Eleven, is better, but with star players and a nifty new shooting mechanism, it would be hard to argue it's worse. Priced at a frugal $29.99, this soccer title is a great value and a nice end to this console generation."
