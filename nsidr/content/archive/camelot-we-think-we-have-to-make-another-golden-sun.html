In a Game Informer interview with Camelot brothers Hiroyuki and Shugo Takahashi discussing Capcom's <i>We Love Golf</i> for Wii, the interviewers slipped in a question about the potential to a sequel to Nintendo-published Game Boy Advance RPG <i>Golden Sun</i>.  The response:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">GI: I hate to totally break away from all the sports' games, but there's another game Camelot is known for, and that's Golden Sun. What's the status of Golden Sun, and is that series finished or is that something you'd like to bring to consoles?<br />
<br />
Hiroyuki Takahashi: First of all, I love that game and I love the world of Golden Sun. We think we have to make another one. We have to do it! Not just that we have to do it, but we want to do it. Nintendo has asked us to please make it. But at the same time we haven't gotten around to making it. We're not really sure why. (laughs)<br />
<br />
Shugo Takahashi: As Camelot, we think of ourselves as being a company that makes RPGs. In an RPG you role-play as another character. In the sports games, you're role playing as yourself. I want to let the fans know that in the center of our way of thinking the games that we're making now are close to RPGs. The looks and the concepts might be totally different but the essence of the game contains the RPG. One of the reasons that we haven't made Golden Sun is because there are so many fans of the game and we don't want to do something half-assed. We want to give it the time it deserves.</div><br />
