<p>GameIndustry.biz has interviewed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick</a>, Nintendo Europe Managing Director of Sales and Marketing. He speaks how Nintendo is approaching the release of its games with a global strategy and that future releases from territory to territory will be more consistent. Check out the full interview <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=9213">here</a>.  An excerpt is below:</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p><b>Q: You describe the Micro as a no-brainer; does that imply that you'll be positioning it at an impulse buy price point?</b></p>

<p><b>Jim Merrick:</b> We don't have a price point for it yet. But yeah... I think that it's a very premium design, very sleek design. I'd like to see the price between SP and DS, but exactly where, I don't know. We're still kind of negotiating what we can do with it.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for that is that because we surprised people with it at this show, we have not had the opportunity to do any consumer research - so I'm looking very much to get feedback from retailers and consumers, and from your readers, to find out where this product should be.</p>
