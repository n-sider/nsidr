<p>GameSpot has acquired Nintendo's new commercial that will begin airing for <i>Metroid Prime Echoes</i>.  The piece shows a young woman walking provocatively down a dark hallway and then being consumed, attracting like a magnet, dozens of pieces of armor until the form of Samus is seen.  She stops and aims her canon at the screen while the traditional "Who are you?" logo is displayed.  Check out the full video near the bottom of this <a href="armor.http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/metroidprime2/news_6112852.html">page</a>, courtesy of GameSpot.</p>
