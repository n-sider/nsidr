Tendo Dokuta, the dramatic hospital sim developed by Spike that paved the way for Trauma Center, is now getting a North American and European release as <i>Lifesigns: Surgical Unit</i> here and <i>Lifesigns: Hospital Affairs</i> across the pond.<br />
<br />
The story has you playing as a young doctor attempting to work his way up the ladder and become chief surgeon. Along with examining and operating on patients, the game features a dramatic storyline attempting to emulate soap operas. Minigames to lighten the mood, such as catching snakes and cooking, will also be present.<br />
<br />
The game is being published by JoWooD in Europe and Dreamcatcher, a JoWooD subsidiary, in North America. Both versions are set to release some time this summer.
