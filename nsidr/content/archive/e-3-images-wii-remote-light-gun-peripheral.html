<p><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/707/707077p1.html">IGN.com</a> snapped a picture of the Nintendo Wii remote controller "light gun" peripheral.  As seen above, the light gun is a plastic shell that will encase the controller and connect to the "device out" port on the bottom of the remote.  We hope to learn more details soon.</p>
