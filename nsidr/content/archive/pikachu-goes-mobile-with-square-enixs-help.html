<p>Famitsu has revealed <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9011">a new collaboration</a> between Square-Enix and Nintendo to bring Pok&eacute;mon properties to mobile phones with a new phone application for the Japanese market.  The application the collaboration is building is not any sort of entry in the popular series, but rather an e-mail application laced with virtual pet capabilities.</p>

<p>Nintendo has recently been flirting with the mobile phone market, having launched <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1757">Pok&eacute;mon Mobile content</a> in North America in February and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1574">launched a UK WAP portal</a> to provide Nintendo content back in December.  It first <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=6417">dipped its toes into the market</a> back in September with Nintendo Mobile in Japan, providing ringtones and animations to mobile users there.</p>
