<p>GameDaily BIZ has posted an interview with Nintendo EAD General Manager Takashi Tezuka, held last month at E3. In the interview, Tezuka comments on his working relationship with Shigeru Miyamoto, the possibility of a new 3D Mario DS game, the Wii's reception, and even some Zelda. Below are a couple highlights.

<p>You can find the full interview <a href=http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=13045&page=2>here</a>.

<font size=2><p><b>GameDaily: </b>So, I have to ask, what do you think about Sony now including motion sensing in its PS3 controller?

<p><b>Takashi Tezuka: </b>[Laughs] Well, I haven't touched it so I can't say what it feels like [to play with] or anything like that, but just for us, we have the easiest controller for what we're trying to do...I just like our functionality.

<p>[Nintendo rep adds] The Wii was designed for this. You're talking about a DualShock controller with an added feature. So it's just two highly different controllers. We have a clear vision and a concept, centered around the new ways to control and new ways to play. And that's different from what Sony has said they're doing.

<p><b>GameDaily: </b>During the Nintendo media briefing, Nintendo of America's Reggie Fils-Aime said that Twilight Princess is the "best Zelda ever made." If that's true, that's quite a statement. Do you agree with Reggie's assessment?

<p><b>Tezuka: </b>Well, I think everybody's going to have a different opinion depending on what you're looking at when you play... there are a lot of different factors that will influence or impact that decision. I think this is a game that [the team] has taken a lot of pain and a lot of care to make, and that's definitely evident from beginning to end that you can see the amount of work and detail that's been put into the project... Even to the point where I'm [sometimes] surprised and will go, "Who's responsible for this amount of detail, for this one section?" This is amazing even to me.</font>
