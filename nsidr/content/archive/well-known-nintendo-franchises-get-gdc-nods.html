The ongoing 2008 Game Developers Conference sports its own awards: the Game Developers Choice award, chosen by attendees.  Nintendo let us know today that they managed to walk away with Best Handheld Game of the Year for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>, which they also noted is still moving copies with 1.1 million LTD sales in the U.S.<br />
<br />
Nintendo got three nominations overall, including to the Hourglass win.  <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> was put up for both Best Game of the Year and Best Game Design&#8212;Valve's <i>Portal</i> beat it out in both categories.
