<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1425">reported Nintendo would be an exhibitor at the 2006 International CES show</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.revolutionreport.com/">Revolution Report</a>, the original source for the story, has since <a href="http://www.revolutionreport.com/index.php?act=articles&code=read&id=142">received a letter from CES</a> indicating that Nintendo's presence in the show is "not yet official".  Interestingly, the <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/attendees/markets/gaming.asp">webpage in question</a> at CES's site still makes this claim at press time (emphasis ours):</p>

<blockquote><p>It's all fun and games for AMD, Apex Digital, ATI, Logitech, Nvidia, Alienware, Microsoft, Sony, <b>Nintendo</b> and Gizmondo. Okay, maybe not all. These companies are serious when it comes to gaming and digital entertainment, and that's why <b>they'll be at the 2006 International CES</b>.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, Nintendo does not appear in the <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/attendees/directory/default.asp">exhibitor directory</a>.  Given this apparently conflicting information, we cannot say either way whether Nintendo will be at the show.  Stay tuned for an official announcement, as well as speculation on what they may be exhibiting.</p>
