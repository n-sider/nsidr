<p>Am I alone in saying that the SNES <i>Megaman X</i> series is among the better 16-bit franchises to ever grace a console? Don't get me wrong -- I love Capcom and the direction they've taken over the years as much as the next guy -- but these screens from <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?url=http://www.jeux-france.com/news14968.html&lp=fr_en&tt=url">Jeuxfrance</a> seem to signal a return (at least in spirit) to what made the Megaman games so loveable.</p>

<p>The new adventure for DS features two playable characters -- a male named Van and a female named Eile -- whose stories will be tied together through various animated cut-scenes. By collecting "live metal", players can expand their Hunter Armor from Z to X mode as well as utilize special powers.</p>

<p><i>Megaman ZX</i> is slated for a December, 06 release in Japan. Expect full details on the American build as they develop.</p>
