In what might be a coup for cornering non-core markets on the Nintendo DS, Majesco yesterday shipped <i>The New York Times Crosswords</i> for the handheld platform.<br />
<br />
Budcat Creations' software features more than 1,000 crosswords from the Times' archive and is playable using handwriting recognition or an onscreen keyboard.  Game modes include "Puzzle Me Quick" for a fast fix, "Puzzle Week" for extended play and higher difficulty, and a challenge mode with time and difficulty settings.  4-player co-op and competitive play is also available, enabling players to solve puzzles together or against each other.<br />
<br />
Inexplicably rated T for Teen, the title will sell for $29.99 and hits stores soon if it's not already on the shelves.
