<p>Nintendo of America this morning released launch-to-date sales figures for its current platforms, as well as sales figures for its major franchises.</p>

<p>In platforms, the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> is making an impressive showing with 2.37 million units sold in the US out of 8.83 million worldwide.  Software sales for the platform have reached 5.16 million US, 23.8 million worldwide; showing a discrepancy in software/hardware ratios with the US at 2.17:1 vs. the rest of the world at 2.6:1 &mdash; the latter figure probably buoyed by Japan's excellent selection of Nintendo DS software that is just not yet found stateside.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=11">Nintendo GameCube</a> continues to sell, hitting 10 million units in the US and 19.31 million worldwide.  GameCube software sales have reached 79.49 million in the US and 169.51 million worldwide.</p>

<p>All versions of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a> have sold 29.8 million units stateside and 70.04 million units worldwide.  Software sales in the US, interestingly, sells at nearly half the software/hardware ratio as Nintendo GameCube software, reaching 128.34 million.  Worldwide, the Game Boy Advance software number is 296.12 million.</p>

<p>Those who got a chance to listen to Nintendo's E3 2005 preshow conference remember <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</a> talking about the 2 billion software units Nintendo had sold worldwide.  To date, Nintendo has sold 360 million units of software in the US, and 2.09 billion worldwide.  Definitely nothing to sneeze at.</p>

<p>Finally, on an interesting note, Nintendo also revealed the performance of their top five franchises in terms of software sold.  Mario topped the list at 184 million units, followed closely by Pokmon with 143 million units.  Zelda, Donkey Kong, and Metroid completed the list with 47, 44, and 11 million units each, respectively.</p>
