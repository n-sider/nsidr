<br />
Steve replaces outgoing 22-year veteran Juana Tingdale, who is retiring March 5.  Tingdale was responsible for managing relationships with publishers.<br />

Replacing Steve, taking over as director and GM of the Latin America territory, is Melissa Wright.  Wright has worked with Singer since 1999 developing the Latin America business within NOA.
