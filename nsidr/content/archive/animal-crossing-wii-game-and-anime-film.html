Animal Crossing, released for the Nintendo DS in November 2005, has already sold over three million copies worldwide. Shimura, known for his work on Master Keaton and Shin Angyo Onshi, will head this new film that is said to retain the themes that have made the game so successful.  There is currently no word on a release date or plans for a North American debut.</p>
