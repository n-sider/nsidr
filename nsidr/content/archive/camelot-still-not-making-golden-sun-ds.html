Camelot, creators of the Game Boy Advance's <i>Golden Sun</i> series, would really like to make a Golden Sun for DS&#8212;but it's not happening, as it has not been for many years.<br />
<br />
The comments were given in a Eurogamer interview with Hiroyuki and Shugo Takahashi, the brothers in charge of the studio, as they talked with the outlet about their most recent release, Capcom's <i>We Love Golf</i>:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">Eurogamer: It's been a while since you made an RPG&#8212;do you still like the genre, and will you be returning to it in the future?<br />
<br />
Takahashi brothers: Camelot is an RPG maker. We don't think that we'll ever quit making RPGs.<br />
<br />
Eurogamer: So that's Golden Sun DS, yeah?<br />
<br />
Takahashi brothers: It would be great, wouldn't it! [Laughing] We want to play that game too, just as much as you. We love Golden Sun! We are working on a lot of different things&#8212;a lot of different design documents and so on, including some different RPG ideas. Don't worry, we're thinking about RPG stuff! We've got all these ideas, many many different things we're thinking about&#8212;but of course, we still have just one team, so we'll see what happens.</div><br />
