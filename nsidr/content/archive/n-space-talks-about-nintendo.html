<p>Fellow Nintendo website Nintendojo.com recently chatted with the fine folks over at Orlando studio n-Space, who are currently working on the Nintendo GameCube exclusive, Geist.

<p>According to n-Space, it is "a whole new world" working under Nintendo, and to call it a learning experience would be an "understatement". Strict adherence to secrecy was well asserted. 

<p>Also, n-Space did confirmed that they were currently working on titles other than Geist and Hope (Hope is still a mysterious title with little information known about it).

<p>Unfortunately, no details were given about any of n-Spaces projects.
