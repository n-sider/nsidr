<p><a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2006/05/10/">Opera Software</a> announced that it will provide its Opera browser to Nintendo's new generation game console, Wii.  Users of the Wii console have the opportunity to browse the Internet using their consoles using the Wii remote controller.</p>

<p>"Nintendo is clearly visionary in leading the gaming industry into the new era in gaming, and a wonderful partner for Opera," says Jon von Tetzchner, CEO, Opera Software. "We are thrilled to expand our partnership with Nintendo, and work with them to deliver the best gaming experience on the Wii console and the Nintendo DS."</p>

<p>"For our Wii console launch in 2006, we required a browser that was fast and secure with support for the latest standards including AJAX. Opera proved perfect for our purposes and is an exceptional addition to both the Nintendo DS and the Wii console," said <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a>, senior managing director and general manager, Integrated Research & Development Division, Nintendo Co., Ltd.</p>

<p>Opera and Nintendo previously announced a partnership to bring the Opera browser to the Nintendo DS. The Nintendo DS browser is scheduled for release in Japan this summer.  Pricing and other dates will come at a later time.</p>
