<p>Also during the Game Developers Conference keynote, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata revealed partnerships with Sega and Hudson to offer downloadable access to their classic games via Revolution's Virtual Console. According to a Nintendo press release, "Revolution owners will be able to relive their past gaming glories from the Sega Genesis console by playing a "best of" selection from more than 1,000 Genesis titles, as well as games sold for the TurboGrafx console (a system jointly developed by NEC and Hudson). These games join Revolution's access to 20 years of fan-favorite Nintendo games from the NES, Super NES and Nintendo 64 eras."</p>

<p>  Furthermore, according to Iwata, Nintendo's Virtual Console is the videogames version of iTunes Music Store. Others will offer such a service, he says, but it won't be the same.</p>
