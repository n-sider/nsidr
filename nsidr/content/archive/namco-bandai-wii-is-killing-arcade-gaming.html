Namco Bandai has announced the impending closure of roughly one-fifth of their arcades in Japan, and are blaming Wii for the downturn in their business.<br />
<br />
"A lot of the types of games that people played at an arcade can now be done at home," spokesman Yuji Machida said.  Wii was popular over the holiday season, and Machida speculates that Japanese kids are saving up their yen for Wii games and hardware instead of spending them at arcades.<br />
