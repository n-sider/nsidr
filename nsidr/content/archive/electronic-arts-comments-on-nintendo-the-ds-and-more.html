<p>Eletronic Arts chief executive Larry Probst was interviewed by GamesIndustry.biz during the past E3 Expo.  Below are some of Probst's Nintendo-related comments.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p>"We're thinking of DS as the 18 and under crowd and PSP as the 18 and over crowd. We think you're going to see a higher price point, at least initially, on PSP and different types of software as opposed to what's going to be on the DS."</p>

<p>"I think there's appeal to different audiences, different demographics at a different price point and we'll be represented on both systems. I think we're going to be more prolific on PSP than on DS, but we'll support both."</p>

<p>"As far as we're concerned, three is better than two. We very much hope that Nintendo stays in the business, brings a next generation console to market and is successful with that. I think that's a good thing for the industry."</p>

<p>"What I will tell you is that we've had more exposure to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 2 technology than to whatever Nintendo is planning. But once they're ready then we'll engage with them as well."</p></font></blockquote>
