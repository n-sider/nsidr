<p>An update to the Games Conference site shows Nintendo and Electronic Arts are to <a href="http://www.gc-germany.com/pressetermine.shtml">share a press conference</a> at 2:00 p.m. in the Forum.  It's not currently known what they will be discussing, but it's likely EA's commitment to Wii, especially with their dedicated Wii development group in Burnaby, will be trumpeted.</p>

<p>Both Nintendo and EA also have their own, separate conferences earlier in the day.</p>
