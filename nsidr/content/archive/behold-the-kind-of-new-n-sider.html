If you're among our more doting followers, you may notice that things are looking a little different around here.  Don't let appearances fool you &#8212; we aren't becoming a blog.  Rather, we just think this format will make both reading and writing for the site an easier and more enjoyable experience for all those involved.  Consider it the slightest taste of things yet to come.<br />
<br />
We wanted to get things up and functional in time for the E3 boom, so a few items that have fallen by the wayside will pop up within the next 24-48 hours.  The content archive will gain some additional browsing options, we'll put up our brand new review index, and our old columns will come back online.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for our E3 coverage, starting with Nintendo's much-anticipated preshow event, which begins today at 9am PST.
