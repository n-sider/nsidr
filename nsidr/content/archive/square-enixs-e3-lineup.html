Square Enix has revealed its E3 lineup for this year, as well as confirmed some release dates. As expected of the Japanese developer, the majority of the games at the show are from its immensely popular Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest franchises. Nintendo platforms, especially the DS, will see a lot of action from Square Enix at this year's E3.<br />
