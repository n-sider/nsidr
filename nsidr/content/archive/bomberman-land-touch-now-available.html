Atlus U.S.A. has announced that <i>Bomberman Land Touch!</i> for the Nintendo DS is now available in stores.<br />
<br />
Bomberman Land Touch! includes several game modes, such as an adventure mode and a minigame mode.  What Bomberman fans will probably be most interested in, though, is the Battle Pack, where the classic Bomberman game can be played either locally or against friends with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.<br />
<br />
Bomberman Land Touch! has been getting decent reviews in the press, though Planet GameCube notes some problems with the online play:<br />

<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Aaron Kaluszka, Planet GameCube</span>Online multiplayer is limited to a maximum of four human players, and CPUs control the remaining players. Unfortunately, there seems to be some problems with the network code as games can be extremely laggy. The more players there are, the more chance there is of this lag occurring. Even when the game runs at full speed, an occasional lag can cause players to mistime their actions, with potentially fatal results. This makes online multiplayer often unplayable, but when it does work, it's quite fun. <b><a href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/reviewArt.cfm?artid=12000">(8.5)</a></b></div></div><br />
Planet GameCube's review is, as of press time, the only one that counts for the game's <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/933157.asp">85% average ranking</a> at GameRankings.
