<p>The European Union Trade Commission has issued a $1.9 million fine on American trading card company Topps, according to PolygonMag.com.</p>

<p>The fine is said to be a result of the company pressuring retailers to not import lower priced Pokemon cards from other vendors in Europe.  The company reportedly charged prices 2-3 times more in some areas of the continent such as Finland compared to other locations in Europe.</p>

<p>A European Union spokesperson said, "Agreements designed to prevent imports between member states lead to a fragmentation of the EU's single market and kept consumer prices artificially high."</p>
