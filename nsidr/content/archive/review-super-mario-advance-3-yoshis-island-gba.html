<b>Yoshi's Island - Super Mario Advance 3</b><br>

<font size="1"> 1995-2002 Nintendo</font>



<P>Theres something going on over at Kyoto.  Theyve realised that a new generation of gamer absolutely <B><I>needs</i></b> to play the finest 2D platform games ever created.  The release of <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioadvance.htm"><i>Super Mario Advance</i></a> served to whet the appetites for what was to come.  <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioworld.htm"><I>Super Mario World</i></a>, the pinnacle of 2D platforming was then released. And now, the mighty Nintendo flexes some serious muscle.  And not a moment too soon.



<P>A quick history lesson:  At a time when the world was drooling over <I>Donkey Kong Country</i> and its then-revolutionary ACM (Advance Computer Modelling) graphics technique, Nintendo of Japan unleashed <I>Yoshis Island</i> to the world.  Pencil-drawn graphics, Super-FX chip enhanced, 16mbits, Mario (as a baby), and the return of the loveable Yoshi, it was still met with some initial scepticism.  You dont control Mario!?! they said. Its graphics are crap, they said.  It doesnt play like a real Mario game, so it mustnt be any good, they said.  And then they played it, Donkey Kong Country-what?, they asked.  Its fair to say that no one was quite prepared for <I>Yoshis Island.</i>  But with ingenious level design, spectacular graphics, peerless control, perfect learning curve, and that magic Miyamoto touch, no one could deny its place in history.



<P>Fast-forward to 2002 and <I>Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshis Island</i> has arrived once again to show the world how to make a platform game.  Alongside <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioworld.htm"><I>Super Mario World</i></a>, this can rightfully claim its classic status among the all-time greats of videogame folklore.



<P><B>Features </b>

   <LI>  Seven worlds plus bonus levels

   <LI> Several mini-games

   <LI> <B>Only for</b> Game Boy Advance (Of course!)

  </ul>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/reviews/9stars.jpg" align="left"><A HREF="Mailto:mark@n-sider.com"><B>Mark Medina:</b></a>When I <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioworld.htm">reviewed <I>Super Mario World,</a></i> I talked about two types of gamer, old and new.  It would be so easy in this review to say Apply everything I said there to <i>Yoshis Island</i>, and go out and buy the game!, but that would be an injustice to you, me, and of course the incredible <I>Yoshis Island.</i>



<P>Once again I truly do wish that I were coming to <I>Yoshis Island</i> as one of the new gamers.  Its filled with so many memorable instances, from the first time you lay an egg, to losing baby Mario, to throwing eggs, and right down to finding that last little star or red coin to give you 100% for the level.  As with <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioworld.htm"><I>Super Mario World</i></a>, every little thing in <I>Yoshis Island</i> combines to give you that magical feeling.  Pure gaming bliss.



<P>Forget the <I>Mario Bros.</i> Add-on, as its just the same thing thats been included in the two previous <I>Super Mario Advance</i> games.  Actually, a quick word about that.  Why in the world is Nintendo persisting with this?  Its been there on the two other <I>Super Mario Advance</i> releases, so why rehash it over and over?  Give us something new please! Anyway, its a fun diversion for those who dont have either of the other <i>Super Mario Advance</i> games.



<P>Technically, once again Nintendo has done an amazing job with porting the game to GBA.  For all intents and purposes this is exactly the same game as the original SNES version.  The fact that you can barely tell, if at all, that the game is any different to its original outing is testament to Nintendos technical expertise.  The GBAs four buttons serve the game wonderfully, and adapting from the SNES control scheme to the GBA scheme barely takes a minute.  Game design genius at work.



<P>Great musical tunes, requisite sound effects and that ever-present annoying baby Mario cry all make the cut, and all serve their purpose to enhance the gameplay experience.  In fact, its been speculated that Nintendo purposely designed baby Marios cry to be so annoying that the player gladly went out of their way to retrieve him as soon as possible, for the express purpose of not hearing that annoying cry again!  Whether or not you find that one thing as a positive or negative to the game is entirely up to you, of course.



<P>As much of my sentiments carry over from the <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioworld.htm"><I>Super Mario World</i> review</a>, allow me to reiterate that for <I>Yoshis Island,</i> almost everything also applies.  Its still the same fantastic game it was back then, so to those old gamers,  have no fear.  Jump right in and experience the magic again.  And to the new, welcome to what is arguably the greatest 2D platformer in existence.  You wont be disappointed with this.



<P>To conclude, it must be said that Nintendo is on a mission to remind gamers what gameplay is supposed to be like.  First there was <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioadvance.htm"><I>Super Mario 2,</i></a> then the legendary <a target="newwindow" href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=reviews/supermarioworld.htm"><I>Super Mario World</i></a>, and now the equally legendary <I>Yoshis Island.</i>  The mission doesnt end there, and with <I>Super Mario Advance 4 and 5</i> both announced, its going to be a rockin good time for gamers the world over.



<P>It doesnt need saying that <I>Yoshis Island</i> is another essential addition to a GBA owners collection.  But just in case, I just said it!  Stop reading and go out an buy it now.  A Masterpiece.
