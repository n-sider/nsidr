EA announced today <i>Need For Speed ProStreet</i> for all current consoles, including Wii and DS. The latest game in the series pits gamers in head-to-head races with "the best street racers in a multitude of racing showdowns."<br />
<br />
Continuing the use of its "Autosculpt" technology, the system has been upgraded so that players directly impact the car's performance for the first time as they personalize its appearance. This system also carries over into the game's damage model, revealing the aftermath of collisions. Once tired of playing against the AI, gamers can take on opponents from around the world with the game's online mode.<br />
<br />
Need For Speed ProStreet's <a href="http://www.ea.com/nfs/prostreet/">official website</a> was also revealed, with a trailer and screenshots available to view. The game is being developed by EA Black Box in Vancouver, B.C., the Need For Speed franchise's primary developer. It is due for release this November.
