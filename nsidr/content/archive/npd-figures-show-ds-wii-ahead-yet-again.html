Sales figures for May are out, courtesy sales-tracking outfit NPD, and even with a very slight drop for both consoles compared to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2770">last month</a>, Nintendo DS and Wii are way out in front, with Wii outselling Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3 combined.<br />
<br />
Nintendo DS moved 423,150 units, and juggernauts <i>Pokémon Diamond</i> and <i>Pokémon Pearl</i> were still a force to be reckoned with, with Diamond leading all game sales at 331,000 and Pearl in fourth place with 238,000 units sold.  The Pokémon titles were the only Nintendo DS titles appearing the top ten.<br />
<br />
Wii sold 338,278 units, by NPD's reckoning.  Nintendo's own titles were the only Wii titles appearing in the top ten here, as well; then-newly-released <i>Mario Party 8</i> took 314,000 sales to second place in the rankings below Diamond, while returning sales contender <i>Wii Play</i>&mdash;packed at $50 with a Wii Remote, which normally goes for $40&mdash;sold 227,000 copies, placing it just below Pearl.<br />
<br />
Nintendo's performance was in part responsible for impressive sales gains for nearly all sectors of the game market over numbers from May 2006.  Video game sales went up 48.7%, and hardware went up 67.2% (broken down into a 79.1% gain for consoles and a 45.3% gain for portable systems).  Even accessories saw a boost at 61.3%.
