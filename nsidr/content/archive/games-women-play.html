As I wait for my copy of <i>Avalon Code</i> to arrive in the mail, I'm thinking in the back of my mind about how my wife wants to play it when I'm done.  I was sort of surprised to hear that, but then again, despite being married for 10 years and having known her even longer, I still can't predict with any sort of reliability what games she's going to like.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_left"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3847-1.jpg" width="184" height="246" class="image_nostyle" /></div>I've decided to try to stop guessing.  Instead, she flips through the <i>Nintendo Power</i> as it arrives, tries out demos on the <i>Nintendo Channel</i>, and will just occasionally pop up with a "hey, I want to try this."  I have no hope of predicting it&mdash;how could I ever have guessed that she'd be more into <i>Ninjatown</i>, chasing down all those A rankings, than I was?&mdash;so I just roll with it.<br />
<br />
The industry was trying to guess for a long time, too; the untapped hordes of female gamers were highly sought-after, but rarely reached.  Nintendo finally won them over by realizing that the secret wasn't being overtly "female", but just making games that could connect with <i>everyone</i>.  I think the secret was trying to say not "how can we make a female game", but "why aren't women playing our games"?  Now I'm being pushed by one woman-friend who became a recent Wii addict to join in with a bunch of friends in weekly <i>Mario Kart</i> meetups online, and we're all having so much fun that <i>Excitebots</i> is likely next.  A few years back, most of these same women would only consider games for kids, and now they're into it themselves with a passion I never expected.<br />
<br />
The take-away point: women are people too, with just as wide and varied taste as any man. Expanding the gaming audience to include them isn't a matter of pandering to their sex; it's a matter of making sure that you're making experiences that can be enjoyed by everyone. And I think that attitude of inclusion&mdash;not annexing&mdash;is what is driving Nintendo's success on this front.
