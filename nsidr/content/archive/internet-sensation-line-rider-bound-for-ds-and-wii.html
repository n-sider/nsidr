Via the newswire comes the joyful information that Internet cult classic "sandbox" tool <a href=""http://www.official-linerider.com/play.html" target="_blank">Line Rider</a> is headed to the Nintendo Wii and DS.<br />
<br />
The toy allows players to create various line-based courses for a tiny, sled-bound child to automatically navigate based solely on the most compelling gameplay mechanic of all: gravity.<br />

Says the game's creator, Bostjan Cadez: "As much as people see it as a game I think of it as a toy because there is no score and no one wins or loses while playing Line Rider. I'm looking forward to working with inXile entertainment on the new Nintendo DS and Nintendo Wii versions as they will bring added gameplay and features."<br />

Isaac Newton is sure to be proud from beyond this earth when the titles drop in Spring 2007.
