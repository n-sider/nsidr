Ubiquitous Internet fixture Google is now offering a version of its Google Reader service, which tracks subscriptions to sites like blogs and news, optimized for use with Wii's Internet Channel.<br />
<br />
The service offers Wii Remote-specific control, remapping the d-pad and buttons to Google Reader actions such as d-pad left/right to navigate between items.  If you'd like to check the service out, head on over to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/wii/">http://www.google.com/reader/wii/</a>.
