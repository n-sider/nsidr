<p>Blockbuster said it has launched its summer "Blockbuster Flip Card", which allows unlimited game rentals (one title at a time) for three months.  The cost is $49 and it will be available until September 6.</p>

<p>One limitation on the card is that it can only be used at the Blockbuster location where it is purchased.  There are no late fees on the games as the duration of a single rental, within the three month period, is up to you.</p>
