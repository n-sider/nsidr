<p>Nintendo of America announced this morning that  they will bring the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS lite</a>, their sleeker, brighter redesign of the classic Nintendo DS, to American retail on June 11th for a price as low as $129.99.</p>

<p>Nintendo of America seemed to want to release the system this month, but <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1800">sellouts in Japan</a> made this impossible.  Nintendo at one point was even <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1907">forced to resell units intended for export</a> to meet demand in their home country.</p>

<p>Now that Japanese demand is, for the most part, satiated, Nintendo is ready to bring the lite to America.  The system will initially be available in the "Polar White" color.  This new lighter and brighter DS comes with four brightness settings, so that you can use it to light your path anywhere in the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
