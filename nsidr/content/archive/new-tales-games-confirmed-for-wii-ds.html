Bandai Namco <a href="http://ps2.ign.com/articles/806/806799p1.html">announced</a> a raft of new Tales games today, across several different platforms; two in particular are of interest to our readers.<br />
<br />
<i>Tales of Innocence</i>, for Nintendo DS, is an Alfa Systems-developed title that is slated for a release near the end of this year.  Wii owners will get <i>Tales of Symphonia: Ratatoskr no Kishi</i>, a direct sequel to GameCube exclusive <i>Tales of Symphonia</i>, sometime before spring 2008.<br />
<br />
The remainder of the announcements are for Sony's PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable and neither is a new game&mdash;one is a "director's cut" and the other a port.  None of these games have been announced for American release, but if we hear they are, we'll let you know.
