We would like to extend our best wishes to you and yours for an enjoyable Memorial Day!  Regardless of political affiliation or personal belief, we urge our U.S. readers to remember the service of their military as they indulge in the freedoms they have been afforded by the great sacrifices of many Americans.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
N-Sider
