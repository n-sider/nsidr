Konami and Nestle yesterday announced an already-in-progress promotion deal that will see upcoming Wii title <i>Dewy's Adventure</i> promoted with Nestle bottled water products.  The companies said:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">Through the partnership, Aquapod will administer a national contest and sweepstakes offering consumers a chance to win an exciting rain forest/eco-adventure to exotic Costa Rica along with other fabulous prizes, including copies of Dewy's Adventure. The sweepstakes will run from September 12th through November 30th.<br />
<br />
The program is supported by a multi-million dollar marketing and promotional campaign which includes national print, television, radio advertising, Internet media, coupon offers, in-store point-of-sale messaging, and more. Television spots announcing the sweepstakes will air nationally on major television stations, and will feature gameplay footage of Dewy's Adventure and the Aquapod logo. Radio spots will also support the Program, running on stations nationwide, from October 1st to November 17th. An FSI will run during the first week of the sweepstakes period, reaching 25 million households nationwide with coupon offers as well as the launch of www.aquapodmoms.com website that will provide moms information about the importance of kid's hydration.<br />
<br />
A number of half-liter 24 pack cases of Poland Spring, Deer Park, Zephyrhills, Ozarka and Ice Mountain brand Natural Spring Waters, and Arrowhead brand Mountain Spring Water will contain on-pack stickering that will feature Dewy's Adventure artwork along with the Konami logo and information about the Program.</div><br />
Dewy's Adventure releases today; with luck, the promotion will help give it the lift it needs to beat its poor showing when it debuted earlier this year in Japan.
