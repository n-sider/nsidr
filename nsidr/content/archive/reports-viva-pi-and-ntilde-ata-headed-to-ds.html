Though there's not yet a press release from Microsoft-owned Rare, the company <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=80498">told a Comic-Con audience</a> this past week to expect a game along the lines of Xbox 360 cannibalistic gardening simulator <i>Viva PiÃ±ata</i> to make an appearance on Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
Apparently far more like the Xbox 360 game than E3 announcement <i>Viva PiÃ±ata: Party Animals</i>, a Rare employee told the audience they'd be "pleasantly surprised" when concerns were raised that the DS was unlikely to be able to handle the free-form gardening play of the 360 title.<br />
<br />
Again, no official press release has yet been issued, and no estimated date given for release, but keep your eyes peeled for this one.  It could be quite interesting.
