<span class="dropcap">T</span>here's a young and largely undiscovered sector of music beginning to flourish in the New York City underground&mdash;a subculture most often referred to as the "chip scene" by its veterans&mdash;that involves using sound code from old hardware (in this case, the NES) to produce original music. Like the developers of yesteryear, today's musicians can create songs that run natively on Nintendo's grey box with both brilliant and nostalgia-inducing results. One of the forerunners of this technique is a band called Anamanaguchi. At first glance they represent the typical college mash-up of drums, guitar and bass, but the unique face of this act is their incorporation of an NES system onstage using actual cartridges.  <br />

N-Sider had a chance to sit down with Peter Berkman, Spencer Casey and Charlie Hankin of Anamanaguchi to talk about the process of creating their music and taking it on the road.<br />
