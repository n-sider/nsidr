<p>The new color ships on March 27, and along with the already-released Graphite and Pearl Blue, features the upgraded backlit screen.  All models of the Game Boy Advance SP retail for $79.99.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/staffview.php?staffid=6">Dean</a> reports that the Pearl Pink SP has already been on store shelves at EB Games in Canada for a week now.  Your mileage may, of course, vary in finding this color in your hometown.</p>
