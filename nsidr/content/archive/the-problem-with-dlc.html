The whole on-disc-or-not thing, the developed-after-game or not, these are discussion points sure but they are not the CORE issue<br />
<br />
The core issue is that we don't know how to assign monetary value to "part of a game"<br />
<br />
We've never had to before.  You buy the game and it costs how much it costs cause that's what all games cost.  Sometimes it could seem "pretty light" and maybe it's a little cheaper then, but we never assigned value to specific PARTS.<br />
<br />
Well that's what we're doing now.  How much is a level worth?  How much is a character worth?  Back in the day, a game could have 8 fighters or 30 fighters and that was never reflected in the price.  Why now?<br />
<br />
Is it just project scope?  Who scopes the project?  How are we as consumers supposed to TRUST that it's a genuine scope thing, and not a money-gouging attempt?<br />
<br />
I DUNNO LOL?
