<p>According to <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/707/707800p1.html">IGN.com</a>, Nintendo EAD producer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> noted that although the company's Wii console will not be HD-compatible, its subsequent system likely will. Miyamoto reasoned that the number of HDTV's in homes is "really not that high, yet. Of course I think five years down the road it would be pretty much a given that Nintendo would create an HD system, but right now the predominant television set in the world is a non-HD set."

<p>Miyamoto said Nintendo has instead chosen to focus its resources on the interactivity of the system.  He revealed, "We thought it would be better to create a system that allows you to interact with any TV set you have in your home in an entirely new, different way, and even kind of turn that into a toy for your TV that anyone can pick up, interact with and enjoy - rather than only the people who have a very high-tech, specific kind of TV set."</p>
