<p>IGN has <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/720/720121p1.html">excerpts</a> of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>'s comments to Nintendo Dream magazine in Japan for the magazine's 10th anniversary, wherein he talked primarly about Nintendo's upcoming <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Wii</a> home console.</p>

<p>"It was very important to have it become 'something that would be best to have there,'" Miyamoto explains, talking about the process that went into designing Wii.  He says game systems once held that position, but lost it when their games "lost their fundamental nature as pure entertainment."  The Wii Remote, something "anyone can play, simply using one hand," tries to address this.</p>

<p>Miyamoto also talked about a few experiments in the works for Wii, including a party game where the controller calls out player names to pass the controller to, and one where the controller whispers secret information to players on their turn.  Miyamoto also revealed the intent to productize <cite>Remote Pointer Demo</cite> (which  we <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-wii-pointer-demos">previewed</a>).</p>

<p>Also discussed was the Classic Controller, and the notion that some franchises simply are not suitable for the Wii Remote.  Miyamoto feels some games work better with the Classic Controller, citing F-Zero as an example.</p>
