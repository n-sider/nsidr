After what seemed to be a bit of a shipping snag with <i>BlastWorks: Build, Trade & Destroy</i>&#8212;even though we got the press release saying it "is now available" on Tuesday, my preorder didn't arrive till Thursday&#8212;the game is now in my hands and others', and there's already hundreds of pieces of user-created content available on <a href="http://blastworksdepot.com/">BlastWorksDepot</a>, ready to be queued for download to your Wii.<br />
<br />
The quality varies, of course.  One level in particular that I tried yesterday seemed relatively easy until I came upon a final boss whose bullet spray was so thick I couldn't find a place to hide when he let loose.  But BlastWorks is already beginning to show its promise, above and beyond the sticky-ship mechanic it took from the <i>TUMIKI Fighters</i> it is based on.  Players are already creating both works in-progress like this one:<br />

As well as smile-inducing enemy designs like this guy, who "throws" round shots at you:<br />

While the included campaign modes and sample levels are both well-designed and challenging, the real strength of BlastWorks lies in its editor suite, which certainly packs more tools than I think have ever been on a console.  Mixed in with the BlastWorksDepot sharing system, which lets any user improve on any other user's design, I feel like BlastWorks is for the first time delivering on the user-created content dream on consoles.  It led one GAF poster to proclaim "It's like LittleBigShooter".<br />

If you're interested, Circuit City has a deal this week where you can pick up the game for its suggested retail price of $39.99 and <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/Blast-Works-Build-Trade-Destroy-Wii-096427014959/sem/rpsm/oid/209125/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do">get a $10 gift card</a> with purchase, bringing the net cost down to $29.99.  Of course, much of its long-term value depends on how active the community remains, how skilled they become, as well as the longevity of the game's core mechanics; but I can easily see BlastWorks paying off.
