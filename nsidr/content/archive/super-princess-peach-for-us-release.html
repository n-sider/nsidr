<p><a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/">4 color rebellion</a> has scans from Nintendo advertising <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2005/10/29/super-princess-peach-headed-stateside/">indicating Super Princess Peach may be headed for a US release</a>.</p>

<p>The mention says the game is still pending an ESRB rating, and does not yet have a release date.  With any luck, we'll be hearing more by early next year.</p>
