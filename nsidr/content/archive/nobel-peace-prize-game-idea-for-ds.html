<p>At the Game Developer's Conference this week, the annual Game Design Challenge had game designers offering up ideas for a game with an interesting mission: to <a href="http://news.com.com/Game+designers+aim+for+Nobel+Peace+Prize/2100-1043_3-6052353.html">win the Nobel Peace Prize.</a></p>

<p>The winner of the challenge was <i>Deus Ex</i> lead designer Harvey Smith, whose idea was a game specifically intended for the Nintendo DS called <i>Peace Bomb</i>.  The concept behind the game was that it would network people who would, in real life yet for in-game points, gather together to perform public service tasks such as planting trees or cleaning up public property.</p>

<p>Of course, the game isn't real &mdash; just a concept.  But who knows?  Someday it could be.</p>
