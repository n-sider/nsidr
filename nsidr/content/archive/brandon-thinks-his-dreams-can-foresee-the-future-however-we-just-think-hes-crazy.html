<p>Is Brandon Daiker <i>Miss Cleo</i> reincarnated from incarceration?  Probably not, but he had one crazy dream last night that involved Britney Spears, Wal-Mart and the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>After waking up and wiping the sleep from his eyes, Brandon Daiker began calmly retelling the events of his dream, "Oh, dude, I had this dream that I went to e3 and it was like one big room at Wal-Mart. But I DREAMED the DS.  It made perfect sense..."</p>

<p>The following is a scribbling Brandon created to portray the prophecy he saw in his dream.</p>

<p>"Anyway this DS folds open," he continued.  "It's about Nintendo-cartridge-size-lengthwise. And when you open it, there's one big screen in two parts. The top has touch capabilities."</p>

<p>"It can fold all the way over because the chick was using it as a palm - it was running a palm os on the one side," Brandon continued rambling. "She could load games and open it up so it was the whole screen and the little bottom section could toggle between a desktop/launcher sort of thing, or be stretched to use with the game OR provide menus or other dual features."</p>

<p>Then Brandon began describing the apparel Britney was wearing and at that moment, I decided to conclude the conversation.</p>
