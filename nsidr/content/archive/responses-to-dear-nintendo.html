I didn't realize my little <a

href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1206">rant</a> would illicit

such a large response.  Coincidentally or not, there's also a thread relating to this topic

in the <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=2790">N-Forums</a>.  Thanks for

all your comments of which I've compiled below:

<blockquote><font size="2">
"Please hire more employees to your localization and marketing departments so you can

provide a steady flow of software to the Nintendo DS."<br>
<br>
That's a good idea, but there's more to bringing games to different
markets than just translating and marketing them. Jump Super Stars, for
example, will unfortunately most likely never be released outside of
Japan, because the various characters used in the game couldn't be
licensed.<br>

<blockquote><font size="2">
The article was otherwise good, and I agree with you that more non-games should be brought

to American and European markets, but Jump Superstars would need more than just

localization.<br>
<br>
I've understood that in USA, the rights to all those different characters, which are from

several different anime, belong to several different companies, so Nintendo can't just

translate the game to English and release it. I don't know much about what Nintendo should

do to get the rights to release the game in US, but it's apparently not that simple.<br>
<br>
As for the Brain Training games and some other non-games. At the German Leipzig Games

Convention show, Nintendo had Band Brothers (Jam with the Band), Gentle Brain Exercises,

Brain Training and Electroplankton present at the show, so there's a chance that they will

hit Europe and US at some point. Of course Nintendo had Electroplanton at E3 already and

there's been no news about the game releasing in US, so maybe that's just wishful

thinking...<br>

I fully agree that the Western library, while steadily improving with
the likes of Advance Wars, the Dogs, Kirby and Meteos, could use even
more good stuff like the games you mentioned in your open letter. One
example, though, is a toughie - making a game in the US using the
anime characters within Jump Superstars require a whole lot of
licensing and legal mumbo jumbo that the companies involved might not
want to agree to. On a similar note, Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! wouldn't
sound the same with an Americanized soundtrack. Perhaps, like Katamari
before it, Osu! can come over with Japanese music intact, but will
licensing problems block them? I don't know. As for the other games,
yes - I'd love to see them come over and I think they're entirely
possible. I can understand that the "everyone" in the States is
different than the "everyone" in Japan - Electroplankton might just
not be appealing to Stateside gamers. I do think they should try
anyway. Heck, I'd buy a localized copy just for the damned instruction
booklet even though I've already imported it.<br>

<p><b>Glen Responds:</b>  The licensing issue was not something I considered.  I appreciate

you guys bringing this to light.  It's true that things aren't always as easy as 1+1=2.

Sometimes they become a bit more complicated and we're faced with ((1+1)/2)*(2)=2.

Although it produces the same result, in the second case there were additional hurdles

faced.<br>
<br>
So I understand and respect the fact that Nintendo might very well be unable to bring

certain licenses and therefore games to other parts of the world.  In those cases, I only

hope then Nintendo doesn't get upset that we take the initiative to bring certain games

over <a

href="http://www.lik-sang.com/info.php?category=275&products_id=6654&">ourselves</a>.<br>
<br>
Still, as much as I'd like to see a good new game released, it would be a pity if Nintendo let the game engine go to waste.  Who knows, perhaps it will prove useful when developing the next Smash Bros.</p>




<blockquote><font size="2">
I fully agree with the letter you wrote to NOA. There have been so many great games

released in Japan that haven't seen a release in America. Some of them don't have solid

release dates and others aren't even announced for release in America. NOE is doing a

better job with localizing some of the games. They are bringing Band Brothers and the Brain

Training games. That still isn't good enough. Although great games, there are so many other

games that deserve to be translated and released outside of Japan. Electroplankton, Jump

Superstars, Ouendan and others are the games that need to be released in America and soon.

Maybe 2006 will be the year of Band Brothers, Electroplankton, Jump Superstars, Ouendan and

the three Brain Training titles? I really hope so.<br>

I 100% agree with you.  I am a diehard fan of Nintendo I have over +20 GC, +10 DS, +10 GBA,

and I even have 10 NES, and about 10 N64 games.  Until recently I have never felt the need

or extreme want to actually import a game.  My first import was Naruto 2 and later 3 for

GC, I understand they could not bring those games over.  However Jam with the Band and

Electroplankton should be.  I've recenlty imported Jam with the band and Naruto on DS, and

now I'm thinking about just importing Electroplankton.<br>
<br>
I really hate having to spend +$50 in order to import a game, instead of buying it

stateside for $29.99 or $34.99.  Although the releases of Nintendogs and Advance Wars DS

have settled me down for the time being I still think Nintendo needs to bring more to the

US.  There are many many people that would get Jam with the Band, if it was done properly

(meaning no hip hop no pop, just game music).<br>
<br>
I think you forgot to mention the play yan, it isn't something that would kill PSP, but it

is something that I think the US market would embrace.  I think the problem with Nintendo

is that they think the DS is not owned by many people over the age of 12.  In actuality I

believe the DS demographic is much higher.<br>
<br>
And to add to your comment about widening the audience, all I have to say is why hasn't

Nintendo been able to cover all the necessary genres after nearly a FULL Year of its

release!  That needs to be adressed sooner.  However I do see the RPG genre coming along,

so that is a good sign.<br>

<p><b>Glen Responds:</b>  You're right.  I did forget to mention Play Yan.  It was my

original hope that NOA would bundle the video and music player with the Game Boy Micro. I

think it'd make the $100 price tag much more appealing.  But then you have to realize, ever

since the travesty of the SNES-CD, Nintendo's attitude towards multimedia devices has been

one of fear and disgust.  Plus Nintendo would prefer you primarily purchase and play Nintendo games for your Nintendo consoles.  I recently purchased a cell phone that plays MP3s via an SD Card, so I'm not too upset over Nintendo's decision.  Judging by the design of the Game Boy Micro as well as its next-generation console codenamed Revolution, it's clear Nintendo is trying to appeal to the increasingly tech-savvy consumer.  Including the Play Yan could have also gone a long ways to improving Nintendo's animated-toy company image.  Granted I don't want the company to change its image too much.  I like who they are now.  But I think the Play Yan could have been positive for consumers and as a result the company.</p>







<blockquote><font size="2">
Sounds good so far.  Or, something to the effect of a petition that
would show the demand for these games to be brought over.  Spread the
word!<br>

<blockquote><font size="2">
Can't we get a petition going? I would sing it right away!

Thanks,<br>

<p><b>Glen Responds:</b>  I have to admit, this is the first time I've ever heard of

someone serenading a petition.  I can't sing myself, so I suppose I'm a bit jealous.  If

you meant "sign a petition" (and I know you did; I'm just kidding with ya), then I'm going

to have to reveal some bad news.  Video game related petitions don't work.  Have you ever

heard of the <a href="http://starmen.net/mother3/">Earthbound Petition</a>?  These guys

spent months gathering over 30,000 signatures in order to convince Nintendo to bring the

next Earthbound to America.  It's understandable the company never did since the title

hasn't released in Japan either. However, Nintendo of America later had the opportunity to

bring over Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance and chose not to.  The title was fully

developed and released in Japan.  If a petition that large can't convince the execs at

Nintendo that there is a market for a particular game or product...I'm normally a hopeful

person but when it comes to petitions, I've lost all confidence in their validity.  Of

course if you started one, I'd be happy to link to it but I suggest keeping any hope you

have grounded in reality.  Sorry.  The only thing that will convince the company to bring a

game over is the big $.  Regardless of the amount of signatures we can gather, it's ultimately no guarantee that Nintendo will see them transfer into sales.</p>

Hi, Glen. I'm a Japanese living in America, and I've been back to be a Nintendo fan when I

picked up Nintendogs two days ago (I haven't touched Nintendo products for like 5 years or

so). I've read your article on N-Sider. This's my quick thought to it.<br>
<br>
<b>*** Title with little hope ***</b>
<ul>* Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!
   <li>Ouendan's weirdness is based on Japanese 80's old high school
     madness. It's like Hippies/Afro-hair in America. Characters
     in this game all have Asian look. I don't think this can give
     the same impression to American audience. However, Gameplay
     is nice. I just hope Nintendo had a porting team who can translate
     "characters" in the game. It'll be a lot of work, though. FYI,
     this game didn't do very well in Japan.
  </ul>

<ul>* DS Rakuhiki Jiten
   <li>This is Japanese dictionary. Most of the contents need to be modified,
     then that will eventually be another title.
  </ul>

<ul>* Yakuman DS
   <li>Will only appeal to Asian-background American or those who
     interested in complecated game. I think Nintendo should make
     "Poker DS" instead.
  </ul>

<ul>* Electroplankton
   <li>This worked as a model game on DS. But I don't think it's good
     idea to put this game on the shelf of usual game shops. It won't
     sell well.
  </ul>

<b>*** Title with little hope, but Nintendo should release ***</b>

<ul>* Gentle Brain Exercises<br>
    * DS Training For Adults: Work Your Brain
   <li>These seem basically "Text-based Quiz" games. A lot of work and
     new ideas will be required for their translation. A recommendation
     from a professor of Tohoku University might not appeal to most
     of the American. Need to work with new person, and remake as new
     title. It can take a lot of time. I hope Nintendo is already working
     on this. If they successfully manage it, it'll be a *novel* work
     in the history of game translation.
  </ul>

<b>*** Title that must be released here ***</b>

<ul>* Jump Super Stars
   <li>Jump Super Stars doesn't have universal appeal, but USA has already got
     "Shonen Jump" and numerous translated manga titles available. It's
     been readied.
  </ul>

<ul>* Jam with the Band
   <li>I have no doubt this will be released in America.
  </ul>


I personally recognize Nintendo as a "small" company compared to a
profit it makes, and I think it will continue to be. (If you devide
the profit by the number of its employee, ridiculous amount of money
will show up.) So I think "Solving problems by hiring more employee"
could be regarded as "the last choice" or "not smart choice" by
Nintendo. But I do think Nintendo should have more employee for translations and
for new "English language original(I don't say American-original) taste
titles". Putting less words in the game doesn't seem to work for some
DS titles.<br>
<br>
I apologize advance for my English skill. Have a nice weekend!<br>

<p><b>Glen Responds:</b>  Thanks for the email. You offer a very nice perspective on these

particular game titles and their relevance to the North American market.  I hope Nintendo

of America eventually releases a game like Brain Training, if only to test the water.  If it's successful, it could have a domino effect since third-party developers would follow the lead and release similar games.  This in reality, is what is most important to the success of the Nintendo DS.  It's about providing gamers with a large and diverse library of games. In the end, that's really all I'm asking.</p>

<p>Thanks again for all your comments.</p>
