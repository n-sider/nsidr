<p>This year Nintendo will roll out an exciting and extensive program to provide consistent, year-round exposure to consumers. The Nintendo Street Team will consist of two different sub-teams, which will bring visibility and video game fun to a variety of events, and allow people to play new and soon-to-be released games.</p>

<p>In the first group, Nintendo will have six teams scattered around the country. Each team will have two members, as well as an SUV tricked out in full Nintendo gear. Each SUV will have five mounted Nintendo GameCube stations (two inside, three outside) and two Game Boy Advance SP interactive belts for members, with four GBA SP units on each belt. The SUV also will feature a custom sound system. This portion of the Street Team will be active throughout the year.
In the second group, one team will be stationed on each coast and outfitted with a fully customized truck and a trailer that opens to reveal Nintendo GameCube interactive stations. The trailer will feature 10 Nintendo GameCube stations, as well as GBA SP belts for team members and staffers. It will also have a custom sound system. These members of the Street Teams will be active throughout the year.</p>
