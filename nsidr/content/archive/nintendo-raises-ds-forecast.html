After recent financial reports showing its profit rising 48%, Nintendo has <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20575">upped its forecast</a> for Nintendo DS sales to 20 million units by March 31st, the end of its current financial year.<br />
<br />
Behind this change is the boost in sales Nintendo DS has enjoyed worldwide.  Nintendo has moved 10.9 million units in the first half of this year, up from 3.57 million last year, likely driven by popular software as well as the Nintendo DS Lite.  Nintendo also increased its software sales projections for the fiscal year from 7.5 million to 8.2 million units.
