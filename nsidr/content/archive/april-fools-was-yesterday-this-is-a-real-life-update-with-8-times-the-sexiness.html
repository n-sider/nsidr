<p>It's been a while since we've had one of these updates.  The theme today is aptly-described as "employee profiles". Yay.</p>

<p>These should have been mentioned <b>ages ago</b>, however in-between other work, they became overlooked.  FYI, there are continuous updates to N-Data, however we've been somewhat lazy at keeping tabs on everything.  Here's a Glen-memory-log of employee-related updates (it's about as reliable as MTV showing a re-run...or not).</p>
