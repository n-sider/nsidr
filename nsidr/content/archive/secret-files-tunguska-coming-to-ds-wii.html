<i>Secret Files: Tunguska</i>, a point and click PC adventure game from Koch Media, is coming to both the DS and Wii. The original PC version received mixed reviews, but it wasn't a failure by any means. While the developers have stated that they are working on a sequel, expected some time in 2008, the DS and Wii versions are merely ports of the first game, with controls adapted for the touch screen and pointer, respectively. 10tacle Studios Mobile will handle the DS port and Keen Games the Wii port.<br />
<br />
Tunguska doesn't stray far from the conventions of the point and click adventure genre. Players control the two characters, Nina and Max, by clicking the destination or object, and puzzles are solved by combining and using items in a manner not unlike MacGyver.<br />
<br />
The game features pre-rendered backgrounds and an intriguing (but fictional) story based on an incident almost 100 years ago now. In 1908, an explosion destroyed the Tunguska region in central Siberia, and to this day the mystery of the explosion remains unsolved. Nina's life comes to an abrupt halt when she receives news that her father has vanished. The police aren't helping her, so she goes of on her own and soon runs into Max, a younger colleague of Nina's father. Together they search for clues to the whereabouts of her missing father. It doesn't take long before they discover a connection between the explosion of 1908 and her father's disappearance.<br />
<br />
The DS version of Tunguska will hit stores in the fourth quarter of 2007, and the Wii version will follow shortly in early 2008.
