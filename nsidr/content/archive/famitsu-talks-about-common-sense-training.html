<p>Thanks to always-helpful N-Sider Samer, we've got another interesting look at Nintendo's upcoming-in-Japan <cite>Common Sense Training</cite>, from <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2006/06/01/104,1149170868,54229,0,0.html">Famitsu's look</a> at the title.</p>

<p><cite>Common Sense Training</cite> is what we'll call the title, which actually translates to "Under the Japanese General Knowledge Certification Association's Editorial Supervision: Finally, Questions You Couldn't Ask, DS General Knowledge Trainer for Adults".  The title, part of the DS Training for Adults series, has 2,000 general knowledge questions based on information featured in newspaper columns, TV programs, and the like, and aims to increase the player's proficiency in this area.</p>

<p>Nintendo has collaborated with another party to create this software, continuing on the trend started by <cite>Brain Age</cite> and the just-released Phrasebook series (which is based on a series of <a href="http://www.yubisashi.com/">travel phrasebooks</a> in Japan).  The <a href="http://www.josikiryoku.com/">Japanese General Knowledge Certification Association</a> is providing the questions in the game (as the game's title suggests) based on the questions available in their books and products.</p>

<p>Some sample questions from the Famitsu piece:</p>
