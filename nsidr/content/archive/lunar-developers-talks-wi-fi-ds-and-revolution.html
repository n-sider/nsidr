<blockquote><font size="2">Q: Its almost like there has been a shift in game design; before, the emphasis was new game ideas when the inputs and controllers were largely unchanged, but now theres a new fashion to redesign the controllers and games are catching up with them now? <br>
<br>
Katsuzawa: Yes, Id agree. This is exactly what were seeing with the DS, and with Nintendos Revolution.
