<p>You've heard the excuse before... As such, I'll save you the earful about how busy we've been here at N-Sider during the past months and instead get right to the update I managed to squeeze in this evening.</p>

<p>Although <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=742">Howard Lincoln</a>, former NOA representative director and chairman, might not be as eloquent a speaker as <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1132">Peter Main</a>, he's always been someone I've admired.  His insight on the industry is tremendous and the following retro interview is one of the more interesting he's done.  I'll be updating with several others in the coming days, so be sure to look forward to those.</p>
