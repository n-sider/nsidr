Nintendo has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aQbxH6wrss1E&refer=home">raised its forecast</a> a full 20% to 120 billion yen for the fiscal year ending with this quarter, the company has announced.<br />
<br />
The primary driving force behind this revision is the continued success of the Nintendo DS, for which Nintendo raised its sales forecast to 23 million units (from 22 million).  A strong launch for Nintendo's new home console, Wii, also played into the expectations.<br />
<br />
Edwin Merner of the Tokyo-based Atlantis Investment Research Corp. expects Nintendo "to surpass earnings estimates for the next year or two.''
