Yet another quirky training game emerges from the woodworks of Nintendo. The latest Famitsu reports that <i>Otona no DS Kao Training</i>, or Adult Face Training DS, is being developed internally at Nintendo by a small group of employees, including some from Intelligent Systems. This program is based on a process that the Japanese call "<a href="http://www.facening.com/face/index.html">facening</a>," which is basically performing facial exercises to make one's face look better. Facening expert Fumiko Inudo is contributing to the development.<br />
<br />
Face Training comes with a camera for the GBA slot on the DS Lite; unfortunately, it appears too small for the original DS. The DS is held sideways, like a book. The touch screen displays what the camera sees, which is ideally your face, and the other screen displays instructions on how to perform the facial exercise.<br />
<br />
Face Training is set for a Japanese release on August 2, 2007. It is likely this will never leave Japan, just like nearly every other non-brain training game.
