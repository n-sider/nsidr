Blitz Games said it will bring <i>Possession</i> to the Nintendo Revolution, according to GamesRadar.uk.  The game is currently under development and is said to be designed to allow both on and offline play.  Players will take control of a zombie who leads an undead horde against a tyrannical capitalist corporation. The title currently lacks a publisher so release intentions may change.  Preliminary screens of the multiplatform title can be seen <a href="http://gamesradar.msn.co.uk/news/default.asp?pagetypeid=2&articleid=36509&subsectionid=1587">here</a>.
