GameSpy has announced that it will, as it did with the Nintendo DS, provide online multiplayer capabilities for Wii.<br />
<br />
GameSpy said its technology will provide community features such as friend rosters, matchmaking, and rankings.  <i>Pokemon Battle Revolution</i>, releasing June 25, will be the first title to make use of GameSpy's tech.<br />
<br />
GameSpy's previous efforts with DS were the company's first efforts on portable systems.  Prior to this, the company provided online matchmaking for the PC platform and home consoles.  GameSpy is a division of IGN Entertainment, itself part of Fox Interactive Media&mdash;a division of News Corporation.
