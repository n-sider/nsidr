So I've been thinking...with the original Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo was the 'leader' of home console entertainment.  For the release of next-generation consoles, Nintendo likewise established the formula of adding more buttons to controllers and increasing the graphical performance of the system.  Nintendo's formula has evolved through the years that followed with Sony and Microsoft taking over its reigns.  Especially with its GameCube console, Nintendo has since been relegated to that of a 'follower'.

However, Nintendo is not satisfied being a follower.  And so Nintendo hopes to again take the position of a leader through the introduction of its Revolution console.  Just as it established the current model of the video game industry, it hopes to define the new one.
