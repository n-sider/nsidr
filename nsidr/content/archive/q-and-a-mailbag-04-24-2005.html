<p><b>Edition: 04-24-2005</b>

<p>Behold! I have delivered a mailbag on time. Anyways, Travis and I didnt have a whole lot of letters this week and some of the ones we did get definitely werent life changing. Still, all in all it was a decent week. Id like to apologize to Dr. Doak, who sent in a letter asking if we recommend <i>TimeSplitters: Future Perfect</I>. Due to the hectic nature of the week I was once again unable to play the game. I promise we will publish your letter next week and answer it properly. Remember to send your criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>.

<p>In this edition, one man dictates the cause of all possible Wavebird problems, one reader thinks Zelda has lame stories, I talk a little Monkey Ball, and more ideas for the Revolution controller emerge.

<h3>Replace those Batteries</h3>

<p>It would be funny if all these people with Wavebird problems just needed to replace the batteries.

<p><b>Travis: </b>Yes, yes it would.

<h3>All Possible Wavebird Problems</h3>
<p>Problems with the wavebird are due to one of the following:

<ol>
<li>Receiver is not fully plugged into GameCube
<li>Receiver has been damaged by misuse
<li>Controller port and/or GameCube has been damaged by misuse
<li>The controller and/or internal transmitter has been damaged by misuse
<li>Batteries with too low of charge are used
<li>Incorrect battery type used, and hence #4
<li>Receiver and transmitter are on different channels
<li>Local wireless interference exists (change channels)
<li>A shielding object is obstructing the electromagnetic pathways between the transmitter and receiver
<li>The device is being used in an exceptional magnetic field, hence #8, though a channel solution will not exist
<li>GameCube is not powered
<li>Wavebird is not switched on
</ol>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Well, thank you for recapping all of the basic solutions that we already covered in previous mailbags, Captain Obvious. Did you get all of that out of the Wavebird manual or are you just teasing us?

<h3>Controlling Super Monkey Ball Deluxe</h3>
<p>Hi There, 

<p>If you dont mind, I was wondering how the controls of Xbox Monkey Ball compare with that of the GNC, i.e. how does that analog stick hold out?

<p>Thanks,

<p><i>- Pete (Apple of Enlightenment  on N-Sider Forums)</i>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Hey Pete. Good to get a letter from a longtime quality poster in the N-Forums. I actually had no trouble at all with the Xbox control stick when playing <i>Super Monkey Ball Deluxe</i>. The Xbox has a pretty decent control stick. Overall the game felt almost exactly the same as it did on the GameCube (though its been a while since I played the GCN versions). It was a very seamless conversion. Still, it would have been nicer if I could buy it for GCN instead of the competition. Also, am I the only one hoping for a <i>Super Monkey Ball</i> type game for the DS? It seems like a perfect fit. With a touch screen, the single player portion of the game could have even more precise control. Some of the multiplayer modes might require some reworking, but thats okay. There is nothing Id like more than to face 4  8 other people in Monkey Target online. If Sega gave that to me I might forgive them for their incompetence.

<h3>The Zelda Series Has Never Changed</h3>
<p>This email probably belongs in Heart Containers rather than Q&A, but oh well.  So, in the most recent IGNCube mailbag, Matt (not I) asked which aspects of the new GCN Zelda we expect Nintendo to focus on (between presentation, new gameplay, and story), and which we thought were most important.  I threw up this long email in reply, but since Im the big-hearted type, I decided to pass it on to the good, email-deprived folks at N-sider as well (the fact that Im more likely to have it posted and replied to here also has something to do with it.  Oh, and the site rocks!). 

<p>So, without further ado, let this already-long introduction be joined by the longer part-which-hath-content.

<p>So, I have a feeling (tremors in the [Tri]Force, and all that) that production values in new Zelda will be off da charts, while story and even gameplay changes won't see much action.  Why?  Consider three things. First, you (Matt) said it yourself in the last (IGNCube) mailbag--Nintendo is giving players what they demanded, and for better or for worse, what they demanded is gorgeous graphics.  I doubt there were very many message board rants to the tune of "gampLay in WWis teh st33ming $#%^"; likewise with story.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is, therefore, little incentive for the big N to change anything radically EXCEPT graphics.

<p>As for the concept of gameplay shifts, when has Nintendo EVER changed the gameplay in a Zelda game in any fundamental way?  Even the 3D Zelda's have just been, well, 3D-versions of the same concept originated back in Zelda 1. 

<p>Mind you, I'm not saying this is a bad thing necessarily.  I love me my 
Zelda games something fierce.  But the point is that it's been the same (beloved, but same) game from the NES days to WW (OK, I'll grant you Zelda II was wild and crazy, but look where that went--hint: nowhere).  I was about to dismiss the wolfman concept, as intriguing as it sounds, as FAR too radical for me to possibly believe until I actually saw it and poured some cold water on my head, but then I remembered morphing in Majora's Mask and realized that it could be the same deal.  But that's just it--it's the same deal.  The fighting on horseback sounds cool and all, but how big an effect on gameplay could that really be?  Harder puzzles (and general difficulty), more use of animals, and such all sound good, but they're all extensions of concepts we've seen before.  I'm not sure I could name a change that would rock the foundations of Hyrule Castle, but these ain't it.

<p>Then there's story.  Oh man, sweet, sweet story.  Can you imagine a Zelda game with an actual story, and not just any old yarn, but one deep enough for an RPG?  That would be TEH bE$t rox00rZ EvAR!11  But when's that going to happen?  Really, this is the area I'd like to see the most improvement in.  In fact, that might be the key to changing the gameplay fundamentally AND getting a proper story in place at the same time: take the Zelda dynamic further towards RPG-dom.  This doesn't mean turn-based battles, a party and all that jazz--just give me the good ol' Zelda controls and mechanics but put them in a much larger and more in-depth world with a proper story and lots of REAL characters with personality.  Then the game wouldn't just be 1. explore dungeon 2. smack down boss 3.collect younameit doodad 4. repeat, but instead would feel like a truly epic adventure.  THAT would be truly awesome.

<p>Sorry for the length of the post, but this is something I feel strongly about.  There's so much potential for the Zelda series to explore, which by no means has to compromise the integrity and spirit of its predecessors.  And hey, when it comes down to it, I'll still buy the new Zelda even if it's Ocarina with additional spit-shine, and like it too.  But a guy can still hope for more, right?

<p>Peace

<p><b>Travis: </b>If you think <i>The Wind Waker</i> didn't have an epic story (or <i>Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>Majoras Mask</i> for that matter) then I'm afraid you're a bit crazy.  However, to give you the benefit of the doubt I shall assume you mean that the series has potential to simply be <i>more</i> epic. Of course, that's true of most any story.

<p>I do believe that the Zelda franchise is headed in a more story centric direction.  <i>The Wind Waker</i> had a much more focused story compared to <i>Ocarina of Time</i>, for example.  In fact, <i>TWW</i>'s story was so involved that it took roughly an hour to even get to the overworld and it took much longer than that to have free reign of said overworld.  Still, you won't get any <i>Final Fantasy X</i> type story out of the new Zelda.  Such a story would be too constrictive for the gamer -- not allowing them to use their imagination or explore.

<p>Secondly, I'm not so sure you and I think of gameplay on the same level.  You say that it has never really changed and it is true, the gameplay formula has remained very similar throughout the franchise.  However, there are other aspects beyond the game's formula, namely combat.  Notice how the combat in <i>OoT</i> and <i>MM</i> was more strategic, slower paced even.  Now notice how the combat in <i>TWW</i> changed dramatically in comparison.  Link assaulted enemies with a flurry of attacks and parried to get at them from other angles.  Changing just a little bit ended up altering the difficulty for the entire game.  Don't underestimate the power of gameplay tweaks.

<p><b>Jeff: </b><a href=http://cube.ign.com/mail/2005-04-20.html>Here</a> is a link to the IGNcube Mailbag being discussed. Travis covered a lot of ground here, so I will just comment on one specific point you tried to make. I believe you (and Matt) are completely wrong when you say that the Legend of Zelda series has always had a weak story. The game is not just save the kidnapped Princess Zelda and hasnt been for a very long time. Sure, there may be periods where you have to save her, but the only time that does happen is for short periods during the latter half of some of the games. Thats like saying <i>Resident Evil 4</i> has a horrible story solely because Ashley gets abducted every other chapter. I dont particularly love that she is always abducted, but I dont love having her around either, so its a way to balance things out. 

<p><i>Ocarina of Time</i>, <i>Majoras Mask</i>, and <i>The Wind Waker</i> all featured very thought out and brilliant stories. They all represent different legends in a larger and broader Hyrulian history. Part of why many people seem to think that the games have very little story is how well the story is integrated into the gameplay itself. Cutscenes are not the only, nor are they the best, way to tell a story. What you also have to remember is that these are legends and are told as such. I think Wind Waker really took that concept to a new level. Ill take Zelda over almost any RPG story any day, thanks. 

<p>Oh and one other thing. Nintendo has every reason to improve more than just the graphics. The only way to keep a franchise active and healthy over as long as Nintendo has with so many of its franchises you have to continually improve, innovate, and consistently offer up new experiences. The Legend of Zelda series has been around for nearly 20 years. If you dont believe the gameplay has changed dramatically in that time then your conclusions are based on ridiculously broad comparisons. If Nintendo doesnt offer up a compelling and intriguing experience then it will be disappointing millions of gamers and future sales will suffer as a result.  

<p>On a final note, <i>Wind Waker</i> did look awesome. You visit the wrong boards.

<h3>Letter of the Week</h3>
<p>Dear Jeff and Travis,
 
<p>Thanks for posting my letter before. I appreciated your insight. My letter this time is concerning the Revolution controller or maybe lack of. I've read all or most of the rumors circulating regarding them. From gyroscopes to touch pads. But then I came across this article in a search for possible user interfaces. The link is here:
 
<p><a href=http://www.computerworld.com/hardwaretopics/hardware/story/0,10801,95055,0.html> http://www.computerworld.com</a>
 
<p>So in regards to that the possibilities are really endless. Nintendo has spoke of making gaming easier for those that don't play games and more intuitive for the hardcore. But what can be more easier and intuitive than what comes natural? Hand gestures thats what. So what are your thoughts on this? Is this a possibility? Will Nintendo opt out of a controller completely besides apparently still using GC ones? Any ideas for games that could use this technology?
 
<p><i>- Jeffery C.</i>
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Though anything can ultimately happen I will guarantee you that the Nintendo Revolution will have a controller of some sort.  Introducing something that removes the need for a controller would be quite innovative, but alienate third parties that aren't innovative and just want to release Mega Urban Combat Military Shooter 5.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Haha, yes. The Revolution will have some form of physical control mechanism. We do know that. 

<p>I have heard of this type of technology before. I believe it was the keyboard that I saw in action. It looks promising, but I dont think well be seeing this kind of thing impact the gaming world, let alone the rest of the world, anytime soon. Its still very new and infant technology. Im not sure what to say except that I dont believe the Nintendo Revolution will utilize this technology in any way shape or form. If Im way off and it does, Id be shocked and probably pretty excited.
