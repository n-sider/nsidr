<p>Although she did not commit to or hint at a price point for the upcoming Revolution console, NOA senior director of corporate communications <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1266">Beth Llewelyn</a> offered a glimpse into Nintendo's pricing strategy in an interview with <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/">Next Generation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>While we have not released information about pricing for our next system, we do recognize that in order to expand the market and reach new consumers price is an influencing factor.  Price will be a major consideration in future consoles as the cost of technology continues to rise.  As we've already seen with the currently announced pricing for Microsoft's Xbox 360, gamers looking for a new system around the holidays this year could easily spend over $500, which could be too high for many consumers.</p></blockquote>
