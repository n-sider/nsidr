<p>"Demasked," the current hot project being developed by the team at <a href="http://www.warppipe.com/">Warp Pipe Technologies</a>, has seen a delay into 2005.  The Demasked project, a mysterious service being developed for the Nintendo DS, has been a hot topic of discussion throughout the Nintendo community.  N-Sider <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=day&date=2004-10-06#661">interviewed</a> Chad Paulson, CEO of Warp Pipe Technologies, about the project in early October.

<p>According to a source close to the project, outside interest has prompted the delay.  Another party breaking into the mobile gaming industry has expressed interest in the Demasked service, which has prompted Warp Pipe Technologies to re-evaluate market conditions while they focus on raising the bar for their launch functionality and deployment ability.

<p>The delay of the project carries with it a delay of the announcement that was to unveil the true nature of the project itself.  In a post on the N-Sider forums, Chad apologized for the postponement.

<p><blockquote>"I apologize to those who were expecting information on demasked in November. Although, immediate gratification is not possible, I really look forward to pulling back the curtain and sharing the demasked experience with gamers around the globe."</blockquote>

<p>When Warp Pipe is ready to fully divulge the details of the Demasked project, you can be sure that N-Sider will be first on the scene.
