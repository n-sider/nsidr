<a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/649/649292p1.html">IGNCube</a> spoke with THQ president Brian Farrell to discuss Nintendo's next-generation home console codenamed Revolution.  He confirmed the company is developing software for the console.  "THQ's plan is to serve gamers no matter what platform they are on," he told IGN. "We are commited to Nintendo's [Revolution]." <br>

He further commented that he feels "Nintendo is waking up."  And although he couldn't speak more regarding the console due to non-disclosure agreements he said, "We're seeing more from Nintendo now [for Revolution] than we have on any other Nintendo platform."
