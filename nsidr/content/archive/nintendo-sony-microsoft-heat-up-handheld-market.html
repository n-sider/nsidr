<p>Microsoft plans to make a move into portable game playing devices, according to <a href="http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2006/03/microsofts_plan.html">Mercury News</a> reporter, Dean Takahashi.  "It could be 2007 before the device hits store shelves," he claims.  The handheld arena is heating up.  Nokia, makers of the N-Gage, also released news that its new line of <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2535&Itemid=2">Smartphones</a> will help it attract the gaming market that has eluded its attempts thus far.  "Our commitment is huge for mobile games," the company noted.  "Gaming is extremely important to us."  Finally, Sony <a href="http://psp.ign.com/articles/696/696079p1.html">recently announced</a> some new features as well as a price drop for its PlayStation Portable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo continues to make <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1819">headlines</a> in Japan for the release of its redesigned Nintendo DS Lite handheld.  Gamers and non-gamers alike have been lining up in the thousands in an attempt to get a hold of the unit.  Supply has been limited due to manufacturing difficulties and extreme demand for the unit leading up to launch.  The Nintendo DS hardware has sold over 14.4 million units since its American debut on November 11, 2004.  Game Boy Advance also continues to sell around the world and has reached 74.25 million in sales.</p>
