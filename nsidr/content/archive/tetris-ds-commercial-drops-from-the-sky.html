<p>Have you been watching television lately?  Chances are you've caught the latest commercial advertising the Wi-Fi compatible <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/gaminghub/TetrisDSGamingHub.jsp">Tetris DS</a>.  This highly-anticipated Nintendo DS title arrives in North America on March 20.  The commercial does a decent job getting that message across.  We watch as two planes unload their cargo of colored-parachuters. Like-colored parachuters join together in a creative homage to Tetris.  Enough of the descriptions -- see it for yourself courtesy of YouTube and AdvancedMN.com.</p>

<p>Also take a look at the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=54KCQ-gZbj0">Metroid Prime Hunters</a> advert if you haven't seen it already.  Metroid is also coming to Nintendo DS on March 20.</p>
