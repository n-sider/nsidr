<p>As the smell of the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo begins to fade, the N-Sider staff would like to foremost thank all the readers for participating in the event with us.  We hope you enjoyed our coverage of Nintendo's fabulous showcase of games and hardware.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we'd like to ask to you 'stay tuned' because as our E3 staff return from Los Angeles, N-Sider will bring you some incredible post-coverage with our famous "N-Depth" pieces.</p>

<p>Finally, we'd like to congratulate Nintendo on its impressive show.  A pat on the back to Reginald Fils-Aime, George Harrison, Satoru Iwata, Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo's countless other employees from around the world for making Nintendo's E3 pre-show and E3 show floor arguably one of the best in the company's history.  Nintendo's back, and we can't be more excited about the company's future.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
<i>The N-Sider Staff</i></p>
