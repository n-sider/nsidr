<li>When an evil darkness enshrouds the land of Hyrule, a young farm boy named Link must
awaken the hero - and the animal - within.
<li>When Link travels to the Twilight Realm, he transforms into a wolf and must
scour the land with the help of a mysterious girl named Midna. Using the power
and unique control of the Wii console, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess
features incredibly precise aiming control using the Wii Remote.
<li>The Wii Remote and the Nunchuk controller are used for a variety of game
activities, including fishing and special sword attacks.
<li>Players ride into battle against troops of foul creatures using an amazing
horseback combat system, then take on massive bosses that must be seen to be
believed.
<li>Many puzzles stand between Link and the fulfillment of his quest, so players must
sharpen their wits as they hunt for weapons and items.
Game storyline: Link, a young man raised as a wrangler in a small, rural village, is
ordered by the mayor to attend the Hyrule Summit. He sets off, oblivious to the dark fate
that has descended upon the kingdom. When he enters the Twilight Realm that has
covered Hyrule, he transforms into a wolf and is captured. A mysterious figure named
Midna helps him break free. With the aid of her magic, they set off to free the land from
the shadows.
<li>Characters: Link, Zelda, Midna and many other characters, both new and old.
How to progress through the game: Link must explore the vast land of Hyrule and
uncover the mystery behind its plunge into darkness. As he does, he'll have to enlist the
aid of friendly folk, solve puzzles and battle his way through dangerous dungeons. In the
Twilight Realm, he'll have to use his wolf abilities and Midna's magic to bring light to
the land.
<li>Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Besides his trusty sword and shield, Link will
use his bow and arrows, fight while on horseback and use a wealth of other items, both
new and old. Players can use the Wii Remote as a fishing pole, while a spin of the
Nunchuk controller executes a spin attack.
