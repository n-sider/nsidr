Nintendo is in development with three different Pokemon titles for the Nintendo DS according to a translation by GameSpot.com of an article in Japanese magazine Comic Korokoro.  The first title is a Pokemon puzzle game called <i>Pokemon Torouze</i> and is scheduled for a Japanese release on October 20.  The second title is called <i>Pokemon: Fushigi no Dungeon Blue</i> and is scheduled for a Japanese winter release. A Game Boy Advance version is being developed alongside it and will be titled <i>Pokemon: Fushigi no Dungeon Red</i>.  These two titles are speculated to be similar to Chunsoft's <i>Fushigi no Dungeon</i> RPG series.

The third game is being called <i>Pokemon Rangers</i> and is described as an action-RPG. Pokemon Rangers is scheduled for release next year, prior to Pokemon Diamond and Pearl which it is said to be compatible with. Pokemon Rangers is also said to have some relation to next year's Japanese Pokemon movie and anime series.
