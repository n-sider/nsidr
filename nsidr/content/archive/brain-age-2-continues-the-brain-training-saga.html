After dominating in Japan for over a year,Brain Age's sequel is finally getting released in North America and Europe. <i>Brain Age 2: More Training in Minutes a Day</i> plays exactly like the original, in that you can practice each activity once a day, as well as take a test to measure your brain's age. A graph shows progress in a convenient fashion, so players can easily see how they've improved with each passing day.<br />
<br />
The more you play, the more activities you unlock, for a total of 17 activities.  Sudoku is of course also included, with 100 brand new puzzles.  Brain Age 2 also features a special unlockable: Virus Buster, a Dr. Mario remake, for use in taking a break from training your brain.<br />
<br />
Brain Age 2 will be released August 20, 2007 in North America. In Europe it goes by a different name, <i>More Brain Training from Dr. Kawashima: How Old Is Your Brain?</i>, and will be released June 29, 2007.
