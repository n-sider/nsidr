<p>Rumors are seeping out of Japan regarding a possible 'informative' press conference on February 12th and 13th.  According to IGN, the conference will showcase new Nintendo first-party titles and possibly see Nintendo divulge more details about its new handheld, the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>If such an event were to take place, it is likely very little information would be given to the general public. This event appears to be designed to help people that have an interest in Nintendo, whether journalistically or financially, better understand the company's strategy and goals for 2004.</p>
