<p>Free Radical Design, the studio responsible for <cite>TimeSplitters</cite> and sequels as well as <cite>Second Sight</cite>, has revealed in their <a href="http://www.frd.co.uk/faq.php">FAQ</a> that upcoming title <cite>Haze</cite> <a href="http://www.frd.co.uk/faq.php?id=3#faq_3">won't be appearing</a> on Nintendo's Wii home console.  Their explanation is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>There are currently no plans for a Wii version of Haze. Sadly, the cutting-edge technology we're using requires more power than the Wii has available. If we could, we would.</p></blockquote>

<p>Free Radical was formed several years ago by a group of programmers who had just completed work on <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=18">GoldenEye 007</a></cite> at then-Nintendo-owned studio Rare.  Their first release, the aforementioned TimeSplitters, was strongly reminiscent of GoldenEye.</p>
