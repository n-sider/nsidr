   <H3>Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker impressions from Nintendo Preview Day</H3>

<p>In the freezing cold afternoon of December 9, me and a friend head up to Nintendos headquarters in the Netherlands to attend the second preview day this year for which N-Sider got invited. Nintendos operations in the low lands are lead by people in a building surrounded by industrial sites, busy crossings and a forest. Once inside, we are greeted by Nintendos lovely Bianca van Dort, who leads us up to the pressroom. After grabbing an ice-cold Coke, Bianca shows us the games on display  the likes of <i>Metroid Prime</i>, <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> (Japanese final build), <i>Pokmon Ruby</i> and <i>Sapphire</i> and <i>Resident Evil Zero</i>. And because our playtime with the new Pokmon games was just too short and Metroid Prime and the new Resi are not new to a lot of Americans anymore, let me just talk about The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

<p>Simply said, The Wind Waker is fantastic. A detailed description explaining the sheer genius of the game is unavoidable, though. From the very first beginning of Nintendos new Zelda instalment, you realize this is going to be a unique experience. The games intro seems to show ancient drawings of the Triforce, the Hero of Time and the Master Sword, musically supported by the classic Zelda theme. After a lot of Japanese text -- undoubtedly telling a story thatll take away Zelda fans concerns about where in the Zelda timeline The Wind Waker belongs  we see the island where young Link resides. Its the island weve seen dozens of times this year, but its great to actually be there, controlling Link and starting the big quest. 

<p>The island could be compared to Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time, where Link had to get his sword and shield before going to the Deku Tree. This time around, the player needs to get Links trademark green tunic, sword shield and telescope  a gift from Links sister Arill. After saving a friendly pirate girl, an evil bird shows up to take Arill away and Links quest starts. Together with a group of pirates, Link sails away on a ship to another island. When the ship sails away, a cut scene is shown, showing off a heartbreaking facial expression on Links face as he waves his buddies and grandmother on the island goodbye.

<p>The second island is another one weve seen a lot  the one where Link has to sneak around in a barrel. At first, I thought it would be a lot like Metal Gear Solid, but now that Ive played and finished the level, I feel it resembles more to Ocarina of Times Gerudo fortress. Avoiding guards, sneaking past them when theyre not looking, being locked up in jail with a secret way out  it seems to borrow a lot from 1998s classic masterpiece. Links task on the island is to first shut down all of the search lights, then find his sword back (you lose it when you smack against the wall of the island) and then get to Arill. After I had been thrown into jail for about twenty times, I managed to sneak past all of the guards with the help of my trusty barrel. As soon as I found my sword back, the way to Arill was pretty easy to reach. The cut scene in which Link finds his sister is another one to show off the amazing capabilities the engine. Anyone who thought this Zelda wouldnt be dramatic couldnt be further off. Interestingly, in the same jail as Arill was someone with pointy ears, a pink-and-white dress and blonde hair... could it be? Unfortunately, no. 

<p>Just as Link tries to go and take Arill with him, the evil bird flies down into the tower Link is in and takes our hero. The screen fades, and Link finds himself in a sailboat  still a bit dazed from what happened. Suddenly, the dragonhead on the front of the boat turns around and starts mumbling to Link. After hes done, Links walks up some stairs and has a beautiful view on quite possibly the prettiest town ever in a Zelda game. It not only looks good  it feels lively, theres noise and people are walking around. Two ladies are talking to each other in front of a store, some kids are running around playing a game, theres a guy sitting in front of someones grave, crying, etc. Entering one of the towns houses is a new experience every time. One building is a shop, another one is a stylish house where Link can smack expensive stuff on the floor, making the owner very mad. Every time something like that happens  someone being mad at Link, hitting him, etc.  Links facial expression is worth watching. 
<p>On the new island, youll also get your first encounter with 128-bit Tingle, locked up in jail for a reason unknown because of Japanese texts. Youll see the (now standard for a Nintendo game) windmill, which is broken. My guess is youll have to fix it sometime later with your Wand of the Wind...

<p>Exploring the town is a great experience, but unfortunately because I spent too much time on the second island, I didnt have too much playtime remaining for the new island. From what I can say, though, this game is going to be just as good as your favourite Zelda game  possibly better. Should you import it? No. Should you buy it when it comes out, regardless of what you think about the graphical style? Yes. The game is incredibly polished and shows that Nintendo is still capable of doing great things. I can say without a doubt that the sheer beauty and genius of The Wind Waker is unmatched by any game this generation thus far. 

<p>Id like to thank the Japanese NCL employee for being so helpful while playing Zelda and  Nintendo Benelux, especially their PR and marketing people (Frank Rittinghaus, Bianca van Dort) for inviting us and taking the time to explain things for us.
