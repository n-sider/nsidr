<p>After the Nintendo pre-show Tuesday, the Seattle Post performed a quick interview with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=742">Howard Lincoln</a>, former Nintendo of America chairman and current chief executive of the Seattle Mariners baseball club.</p>

<blockquote><p>On the new Nintendo DS portable gaming device: "First of all, I thought they did a marvelous job. It was a great press conference, and Reggie (Fils-Aime), our new marketing executive, I thought did a tremendous job. This Nintendo DS looks spectacular. It has so many functions, and the way it was presented today was very effective in getting all those features out -- the wireless feature, the touchpad feature, the dual-screen feature, one screen in 3D, the other in 2D. So many things that developers can focus on, and so it's not just an add-on product, it's a completely new product, a completely new category."</p>

<p>On Nintendo's future prospects in the video-game console market: "Well, $99 (the current GameCube price) has always been a magic price, and it's going to remain a magic price. And given the kinds of games that are going to be supporting it, particularly Legend of Zelda, Star Fox ... it should do very well."</p>

<p>On the the industry's growth: "It's fun to see the industry expand. When we started, our press conferences could be in a small room. Now there are several thousand people here. That makes you feel good. It's a big industry and a great industry. Reggie made the point, we've been in this business from the very beginning. And [Nintendo President Satoru] Iwata made the point that many of the things that are taken for granted are the things that Nintendo invented. And the Nintendo DS is just the next thing."</p></blockquote>
