<p>Below are the worthwhile updates for Thursday, March 4, 2004.  There have been massive uploads of sales data for all <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/catalog.php?system=11&region=1">GameCube software</a> (however, the organization system that will include "alphabetically", "released", or "by sales" is not yet available so for now you'll have to look at the games individually).  </p>
