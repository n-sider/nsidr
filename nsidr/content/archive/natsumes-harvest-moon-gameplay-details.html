<p>Natsume has divulged new info on Harvest Moon, a farming simulation in development for Wii.  Famitsu magazine reports the control scheme in Harvest Moon will make full use of the Wii remote control.  Players will use the remote as if it is a real gardening tool.  Swing the controller like a hoe to till the soil and plant vegetables.  Then follow that up with a tilting motion to mimic the use of a water can.</p>

<p>Harvest Moon will takes place on an island inhabited by a mysterious goddess and tree. On one unfortunate day, the tree withers and the goddess disappears. It's up to you to build a relationship with the land and your neighbors and find a way to revive the tree and goddess. </p>

<p>The game's graphics resemble that used for the GameCube release of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life, although there is a distinct improvement in quality.  Expect more details on the game and screens soon.</p>
