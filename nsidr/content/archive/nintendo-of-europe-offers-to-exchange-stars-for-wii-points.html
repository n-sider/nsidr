Nintendo of Europe has unveiled a new purchasable in their "Stars" customer-loyalty program, giving their best customers the ability to buy Wii Points at an exchange rate of 4 Star Points to 1 Wii Point.  At 250 points per game, one N64-era Virtual Console title can be earned with the points from 16 modern titles.<br />
<br />
Wii Points are part of the new online Stars Catalog, in turn a part of the new European Nintendo site.  UK members can swap their Wii Points at <a href="http://wiipointscard.nintendo.co.uk/">wiipointscard.nintendo.co.uk</a>.
