<p><b style="font-size: 20px">N-Sider Q&A Mailbag</b><br><i>Column by <a href="staffview.php?staffid=10">Jeff Van Camp</a>, <a href="staffview.php?staffid=28">Travis Woodside</a></i>

<p><b>Edition: 12-05-2005</b>

<p>Hey, yeah Im about 12 hours late. I think I may have done it out of spite. Its hard to be sure. All I do know is that we got some great letters this week. For the first time, I invited an N-Forums member (Smaug) to join in and answer a question that was right up his alley. The next edition is going up within two weeks, so be sure to send your questions, criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a href=mailto:qa@n-sider.com>qa@n-sider.com</a>. 

<p>In this edition, we profess our love for Resident Evil 4, talk about Wi-Fi, Revolution Wi-Fi, the technical abilities of the Revolution, the Xbox 360, and next generation gaming in general.

<h3>Wi-Fi not fast enough?</h3>
<p>hey u guys forgot to mention that the issues with wifi itself are slower than using an ethernet cable. MKDS while using the wifi option wont have a faster connection than the revo, assumingly with all likelyhood that the revo will use an ethernet cable to connect, giving the game way faster connections. 100bps instead of 10bps. so ppl really shouldnt worry to much :) 
 
<p>- Alex
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>A valid statement, but I can tell you it wont matter too much.  I played Xbox Live using a wireless internet option and games played for me just as they did before.  It may be faster when hardwired, but I sure didnt notice a difference.  Optimization of net code is what is really going to make games go faster.  I certainly know Ill be using a wifi when I get my Revolution up and running.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>As far as I know, the Revolution will also use Wi-Fi as its primary method of internet connection. There is currently no Ethernet port on the system. The only other way it might be able to connect to the net is via one of its two USB ports. USB is also a very viable way to connect. But yeah, they are calling it the Wi-Fi Connection for a reason. ;)

<h3>Calling us out</h3>
<p>Why did you post the wrong version ? I corrected some errors like plausible,legitimate,aren't,definitive!And just so you know I come from Germany and the words plausible and legitimate are spelled like in the first letter over here!and since those words are almost identical it's a little bit confusing at times.You are right, I should have done a spell check before sending the letter,but seriously guys don't you think that it's a little bit cheap and childish to focus on peoples spelling instead of the content?I mean it's true that I could have easily avoided those mistakes I made but you totally missed my point with your response.I think the points that I expressed were certainly unmistakable but obviously you totally misinterpreted them!my endeavor was to make clear THAT THE GAMES HAVEN'T CHANGED with 360 except that they look 'smoother' and that in that sense it is questionable to call 360 a next generation system.It will not be perceived as a next generation system simply because as Travis says it is THEIR NEXT GEN. SYSTEM.The leap between Playstation 1 and 2 was definitly more magnificent!Games like Gta3 wouldn't have been possible on Playstation1 because it didn't have enough RAM and space!That in connection with the better graphics and the ability to play DVDs justified it being a real next gen system measured by previous consoles! It met peoples demands just like the leap from 2d to 3d did.What I meant with 'been there done that' was that after examining the 360 launch lineup I can't help but feel that there don't seem to be games that feature any kinds of new gameplay mechanics or any new takes on the genres.It's just more of the same.No way around it if you ask me.And I really don't think that the visual leap from N64 to N-Cube is comparable with N-Cube or Xbox to 360!Bump-mapping,normal-mapping,specular-lightning,high poly.counts,depthblur,environment-mapping etc. are all inventions of the last generation as seen in games like Ninja Gaiden,Halo2,Resident Evil 4,Splinter Cell 3,Chronicles of Riddick etc. and having seen all of the 360 games I would go as far as to say that some aspects of some 360 games don't quite match what was achived this gen. in said games.Again sorry for my bad english and I hope you won't misunderstand me this time around.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>First off, we take the time to read and respond to reader emails with the best information we can. I read over responses I give, so I dont find it too hard to ask that readers do the same. I dont normally attack letters, but yours featured excessive errors. Id rather you proofread your letters before you send them instead of sending three or four correction letters. Less hassle for both of us.

<p>In any case, I do think youre forgetting what it was like in 2000/2001. The jump from PlayStation and Nintendo 64 to PlayStation 2 and GameCube was not a smooth one. While the PlayStation 2 launched with a record number of games, the initial batch was disappointing. The same can be said of the GameCube, which, honestly, has yet to garner much momentum. The XBX, PS2, and GCN each ended up with some really unique games that defined this generation, but few of them showed up close to launch. 

<p>The Xbox 360 was rushed to the market. Id say Microsoft has done pretty well thus far. Im not too impressed with the initial batch of games, but there are some really neat ones coming up. Gears of War looks really fun and Im hopeful for Silicon Knights Too Human. I cant really comment on Revolution yet, since I have no idea how it will stack up, but the 360 and PS3 are each very capable of producing games that you would define as Next-Gen. It will take time and the innovations may not be quite as apparent as last generation, but they will be there.

<h3>Mario Kartage</h3>
<p>I really cannot believe it. Its like an awakening! What a pleasant suprise!

<p>I have to say that Mario Kart DS is the finest racing game I have ever had
the pleasure of playing. Taking into account years and years of gaming.
Without going into any detail I have to say everyone should play this
astounding game at least once. Its an absolute system seller. Incredible!

<p>Does everyone else you know who has played the game feel the same? How about you guys? Are you going to do a review of the game soon?
I hope we are all rejoicing in some quality multiplayer kartage. On and
offline! And thanking the lord we are all Nintendo fans. We really are so lucky!

<p>Peace out.

<p>- Mark Lee
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>I, too, am quite ecstatic regarding the genius that is Mario Kart DS.  To be perfectly honest, I got a little emotional when I played online.  I never had many good opportunities to play multiplayer games at home because my twin brother started getting into other things and the only friend that lived close by had a PlayStation, but now I can play with friends from afar and its a truly remarkable opportunity.

<p>We wont be reviewing the game though, Mark.  We dont review any games on our site.  Theres enough sites which do that already.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Nope, as of currently, we dont review games. Perhaps in the future well figure out a way to do something close, but we feel that the 100 point scale that most sites use to review games is quite arbitrary. When we figure out a better way to accomplish the goal of the review, well start reviewing games again.

<h3>Xbox 360 shortagefiction at work?</h3>
<p>How you doin' guys?

<p>I was just wondering what you thought about the Xbox 360 shortage. I mean, I'm pretty angry that so far I haven't been able to get my hands on one. Do you think it's for real, or for the hype? Also, what do you think about the Revolution launch in this aspect? I hope everyone who wants one will be able to get their hands on one on launch day. If not launch day, withen a week or two. Thanks!

<p>- Chris D.
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>It seems to be the general consensus that the Xbox 360 shortage is an artificial one instigated by Microsoft.  I wouldnt go on the record to say such things as it is officially speculation, but I honestly wouldnt be surprised if it was the case.  I certainly havent been angry to not have my hands on one though.  I think some aspects of the system are impressive but not $400+ impressive.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Microsoft is launching the system in North America, Japan, and Europe in a relatively tight window, so Id imagine that accounts for a good deal of the shortages. Though, I dont doubt it is a hype tactic as well.

<h3>RESIDENT EVIL 4</h3>
<p>I was just wondering what the staff of N-sider's opinions are on Resident Evil 4 (GCN), which is my favorite game ever.  Ever.  As in, better than anything on the SNES ever.  No, I'm not joking.

<p>- Joe Trotter
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>My opinion of Resident Evil 4 is that its my favorite game ever.  Ever.  As in, better than anything on the SNES ever.  No, Im joking.

<p>It is a great game and certainly my third favorite of this generation, but Im unable to rank it quite that high, though I do not mean to undermine your opinion of it.  I think it is well justified as it is a truly fantastic work of art.  The only games I would rank above it this generation are Metroid Prime and The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

<p>Im really interested in where they take the franchise from here.  I hope Wesker has a larger role next time around.  Id also love to see Barry Burton (from the original game) come back, but Im sure Im the only one that has a strange obsession with him due to his goofy dialogue.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>It is definitely one of my favorite games this generation as well. I never cared for the earlier Resident Evil games due to their static camera and severely dated control schemes, but RE4 made my brains asplode. Id probably rank it similarly to Travis. Truly a gem and a must buy for nearly all GameCubers. I can only hope that Resident Evil 5 is Revolution bound.

<h3><i>Expert</i> Advice</h3>
<p>Another week, another mailbag, another question. So yeah, my question this time doesn't have that much to do with Nintendo, but it does have to do with gaming (somewhat). I REALLY want to be a videogame journalist. I'm declaring my major in journalism next semester (yeah, I'm in college), but I live in NYC. Almost all videogame journalists I know of live on the west coast. My question is, can I work in this field while living in NYC? I've just got too many ties to this place to up and leave it. I'd also like to know how hard is it to get into game journalism (and journalism in general)? Now, I'm going to go completely off topic. I was wondering, what are your views on Nintendo making movies using their own franchises? I'm asking this 'cuz I read that Nintendo was considering making a bunch of movies using their own franchises. I'm a bit skeptical, after the first Mario movie, which was a complete bust (what was up with those goombas!?), I just don't know. Past experience (Zelda cartoon, Mario movie, all those game to movie movies) tells me that making a Zelda or Metroid movie isn't a very good idea. Thanks for your thoughts and comments.

<p>- Zak
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Im a Journalism major as well. Its really going to depend on what kind of journalism you want to get into. The vast majority of video game magazines are located on the west coast. IGN Entertainment is also located there. However, that is only one path you might take. Im assuming you arent going into broadcast journalism, because thats another game entirely. Anyway, as the video game industry expands, so does its media coverage. Im sure there are some newspapers that hire columnists and reviewers specializing in video games.

<p>I would love to see The Legend of Zelda or Super Mario Bros. as viable movies, but I just dont see it happening. It would take an enormously dedicated and incredible team to bring those franchises to life on the silver screen. Nintendos current plans arent as grand. Originally proposed by former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, the company is starting an in-house animation studio to create a movie based on the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu collection of classic Japanese poetry.

<h3>More FMV please</h3>
<p>Hey guys
<p>With Ninty now adding the video software to DS and GBA SDK is this is a sign that they want more FMV and animation in their portables? Its not really a bad move. If they manage to get Squeenix to put the intro FMV to FFV and VI for GBA it will definitely wow the gamers that play it. Sony used FMV to deceive casual gamers in thinking PS1 could generate does images with its actual hardware. If Ninty get high quality FMV are animated cut-scenes in their key 3rd party games for both platforms such as FFVI on GBA and FFIII on DS it could use Sony's old technique to make people think DS and GBA are much more powerful then people think.
<p>Remember the FMV in Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt? Didn't you think it was amazing? Particularly how it used both screens on occasions?
<p>When Kingdom Hearts: CoM came out I was taken back by FMV intro in the game. Of course we know it isnt running off GBA hardware but with society now wanting pretty graphics so much Ninty really got to give them what they want. By adding FMV to DS and GBA games it will prevent many buyers from dumping them for the PSP. It worked for Sony when the N64 came out.
<p>Another Q would be if you guys think the GBA video range could at least dent Sony's UMD Video range. I mean a lot of kids have GBA's and DS's. If Ninty can get major cartoon companies to release episodes on GBA the kids will further not need PSP. The GBA Video range has potential however the lack of them out and coming out is very disappointing. Especially seeing as it could be used to topple the plans of competitors.
<p>- Galvin Galvanizer Okoye
</div><br>
<p><b>Jeff: </b>I would think that the DSs unique and quality games are what will keep it ahead of the port train that is the PSP. I think the FMV intros and stuff like that are all great and good fun, but I dont think its going to extend much beyond what youre already seeing. Nintendo DS cartridges just dont have that kind of space in them. The largest cart available to developers is 128MB. Its just not economical for developers to pay more for a full size cart just to put in some FMV. Most of them will continue to use in-game cutscenes and storytelling just as they did with the Nintendo 64. 
<p>On the Nintendo 64, only one game ever used the 64 MegaByte cart (which is 512 Megabits if you want to follow Nintendos fun deceit). That game was Resident Evil 2. Most games never clocked over 256Mb (or 32MB). This is actually a good thing for those of you hoping to download Nintendo 64 games on Revolution. They wont take up too much of your 512MB of Revolution Flash memory.
<p>If the DS was capable of running off of CDs and other much larger storage medium, then perhaps we would see games like Final Fantasy VII. Currently it would have to be completely reworked for the handheld.

<h3>GameCube on a computer monitor</h3>
<p>Great site -

<p>I'd like to get rid of my television and play my Gamecube on my computer monitor - specifically a 20" Apple Cinema Display.  Any ideas on how I could do
this?

<p>Thanks!

<p>- Greg Swearingen
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>I wish I could give you a simple answer, but your situation eludes me. The Cube never had VGA cords available for it, so nothing is going to be simple. Youre going to have to have a computer, first off. My friend had his GCN running off a computer monitor, but he had to have the GCN composite or component cables running into a TV card in his computer, or an external converter. This converts to your monitors signal. If you do get it working, make sure to, like him, laugh maniacally every time you boot it up. 

<p>If anyone out there has more specific or better advice, Im all ears.

<h3>Does the DS have regional lockouts?</h3>
<p>Quick question. (PLEASE ANSWER) :)

<p>No one could answer this before because there were not any WiFi games out, but now there is. So could you please answer this question:
Are the Jap DSs compatible with american WiFi?

<p>Example: I import a DS from JAPAN (the colors over there are so much cooler!) and I Take an AMERICAN Mario Kart, and I attempt to connect to an american WiFi hotspot... Will it work?

<p>Also is there any issues with American DS systems communicating with Japan DS systems?

<p>Example. I take a Jap DS with and American game and try to do wireless download play with a US DS.. or Multicard play with a US DS, will it work?
I'm just trying to find out just how compatible the two regions hard ware is. (Because my wife wants a pink one and the nintendogs pink bundle is IMPOSSIBLE to find... SO if I import the pearl or candy pink one from Japan, I want to make sure it would be compatible with my American Electric Blue One)
Any information would be greatly appreciated!!

<p>Thank you, and I love the site!

<p>- Blakepro
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>The Nintendo DS has no region encoding, meaning it can play imported and non-imported games.  I assume this means that wireless communication will work the same as well.  The only thing that would matter is if you have a Japanese version of a game and simply cannot read the text.  Aside from the various colors available in Japan those DS systems should be identical to what we have here in North America.  I knew someone at work who ordered a black DS from Japan and he often played games with me wirelessly and I have a North American DS.  I dont think you have anything to worry about at all.

<h3>Letter of the Week</h3>
<p>I sent a letter that was put up for last week. One of my questions was
about cross platform developing, you guys thought I was talking about
the controller differences, but I was actually referring to the
differences of the hardware, I should have been more clear. I remember
reading somewhere that the development is supposed to be much more
complex for the 360 and PS3 because it required programming for multiple
thread processing, or something like that (the way I gather it, the 360
can compute 6 threads simultaneously). So I was wondering if on a purely
hardware nature, if the differences would be so much that if code that
was created to use the 360  to it's fullest (which would be computing 6
things at once), that it would be hard to port it over to the revolution
which is speculated to process 2 threads at the max, and is supposed to
be very similar to the gamecube when it comes to the development.

<p>- Tim Etler
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Being that Im no expert on questions of this nature, I consulted Smaug (a dedicated poster from our N-Forums) about the issue. Heres what he had to say.

<p><b>Smaug: </b>Well, the answer to that question is somewhat complex.

<p>As far as the PS3 is concerned, there should be little difference. Though the chip has 7 SPE processors in addition to its single dual-threaded primary core (which is hardware-wise identical to any one of the 360 cores), these processors are entirely unsuited to even attempting to run game logic. The only reasonable tasks that one could put these processors to are related to sound or graphics processing. Or possibly some low-level animation work. Basically, they can do things only to the extent that the tasks involve accessing very limitted subsections of memory.

<p>The 360 is a different story. Each of its 6 independent threads can run normal game logic. However, you wouldn't want to dedicate all 6 of them to that, as you would quickly saturate the caches and the memory bus. Game logic is frequently touching memory, and the 360's CPU doesn't have enough cache to really use 6 threads for game logic. 3-4 is probably reasonable.

<p>However, we're not talking about 360-exclusives; those will clearly be tailored to the needs of the 360. What we're talking about are cross-platform games. Cross-platform game development is about coding for the lowest common denominator. This means that PS3 sets the bar, and that bar is 2 threads at most for game logic. The 360 ports of said games will likewise be using at most 2 threads for game logic. Which means that all the Rev needs in order to stay compeditive in terms of porting is to provide 2 threads of execution.

<p>Now, of course, cross-platform developers will want to take the stream-based tasks that they assigned to the PS3's SPEs and port them to the other threads available on the 360. So, where do those go on the Rev? Well, nowhere. The Rev is, in theory, not designed to provide the graphical capabilities of the 360 or the PS3, and certainly not at the resolutions that they want them to have. Any difficulties in porting would be in removing or toning down various effects for the Rev port. And those difficulties are relatively minor.
