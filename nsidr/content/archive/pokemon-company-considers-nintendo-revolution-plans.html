<p>Famitsu magazine recently interviewed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=644">Tsunekazu Ishihara</a>, president of The Pokemon Company, according to <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/696/696754p1.html">IGN</a>.  He was questioned about many things relating to Pokemon including the manner in which the series might continue on Nintendo's next-generation console Revolution.</p> 

<p>"We're considering many plans for the Revolution," Ishihara admits.  "However, there are still areas of the Revolution itself that have not been seen, so we'd like to coordinate with Nintendo's movements."</p>
