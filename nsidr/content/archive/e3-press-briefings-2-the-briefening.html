<b>Matt:</b> We wrapped up our press conference attendances this morning with Nintendo and Sony.  Dean and I went to both while Amber was only in attendance at Nintendo's conference.<br />

<b>Amber:</b> I quite enjoyed the Nintendo conference.  While the complaint could be made that no new IPs were shown, most all of Nintendo's major franchises were represented and there were even a few surprises.  Nintendo wasted no time in kicking off the show with a crowd pleaser: <i>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</i>.  Shigeru Miyamoto came on stage to demonstrate the 1:1 sword play and a few of the new items.  We'll be covering <i>Zelda</i> and a pile of other titles over the next two days so I'll keep the game details light here.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />

Nintendo conferences these past few years have been rather heavy on marketing and sales data.  This year they did a really nice job of keeping the focus on the games, only lightly touching on marketing information amidst the steady stream of game announcements.  Titles presented included <i>Kirby</i> for Wii, sporting a fantastic yarn and cloth aesthetic, <i>Epic Mickey</i>, and <i>Metroid</i>.  Show surprises included the new <i>Goldeneye 007</i>, <i>Kid Icarus</i> for the 3DS, and a 2-D <i>Donkey Kong Country</i> title from Retro Studios.<br />

<b>Matt:</b> I have to say I was a little disappointed in Nintendo's conference.  Zelda's new look was pretty cool, but not a whole lot was told about anything other than the MotionPlus support.  They showed off a lot of entries in well-loved franchises and many of them are likely winners&mdash;but very little that was truly exciting.  I'll make an exception to that big enough to drive a truck through for <i>Kirby's Epic Yarn</i>, though.  It's not just the aesthetic, either, but all the sweet stuff you can <i>do</i> with it.  I plan on writing more about this neat game, which I did get a brief chance to try, so stay tuned.<br />
<br />
3DS was great to finally see&mdash;they let us take a peek at some impressive demos on the way out&mdash;but it presentation also held almost no surprises.  We'd already imagined it all, apart from the motion sensitivity and the neat concept of Tag Mode as a system service, including automatic Wi-Fi downloads.  I hope games use this to as full an extent as possible; I couldn't help but think of the promise of WiiConnect24 that went underdelivered even when we understood that it was just a messaging service.  Time will tell.  I should say that it really looks great, though, even if it's not the final system design.<br />

As for Sony: their conference did largely fly outside my sphere of interest, though I took particular note of a really neat-looking Move game called <i>Sorcery</i>, involving some cool wand-swinging spellcasting action.  <i>Little Big Planet 2</i> also looked pretty interesting and quite ambitious.  Kevin Butler was hilarious as usual.  The last thing of note was the announcement of pricing for Move.  $49.99 for the lollipop wand, and the crowd cheered.  Next slide.  $29.99 for the secondary controller.  Oh, so you don't have a camera?  Next slide.  And so on.  Let me just say that I don't want to hear anyone complain $60 is too much for a Remote+Nunchuck combo ever again.<br />

All-in-all, it turned out to be a pretty busy day&mdash;and a site outage ate some of our live coverage posts besides&mdash;but stay tuned, we'll be sharing more with you tomorrow.
