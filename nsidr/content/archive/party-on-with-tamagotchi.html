Namco Bandai has announced their intent to bring <i>Tamagotchi Party On!</i> to North American Wii consoles this spring.<br />
<br />
Tamagotchi Party On! is billed as a competition to become the most popular Tamagotchi on Tamagotchi Planet through a "campaign race" with up to four players.  Party On! is a board/party game hybrid that has players swinging, shaking, and turning their Wii Remotes to control the Tamagotchi, competing in minigames to get elected president of the planet.<br />

The number of minigames in the title is "over 15" and includes such things as shaking hands, finding lost children, and, in a bizarre twist of "the Remote can do <i>that</i>?!", practicing public speaking skills.  Party On! will let you trade points you earn during gameplay for customization of your campaign office, and features six different towns to win over.<br />
<br />
No release date for Party On! has yet been announced beyond the aforementioned nebulous spring target.  Mudslinging is not included in this title.
