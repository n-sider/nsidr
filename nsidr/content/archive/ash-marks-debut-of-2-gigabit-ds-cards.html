This week's Japanese release of <i>ASH: Archaic Sealed Heat</i> marks a first for DS releases.  Mistwalker's FMV-heavy RPG comes on an unprecedentedly large 2 gigabit card&#8212;twice the size Nintendo themselves said was the maximum for the DS when it debuted at E3 2004.<br />
<br />
Game systems generally measure in bits, not bytes; a 2 gigabit card is actually 256 megabytes.
