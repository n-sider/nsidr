<div class="box">There seems to be a new theme of customizability based on what we know about, like the level editor and marble attributes.  Is there more we can look forward to in this department?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Tsuchihashi:</span>That pretty much covers it.<br />
<br />
But, again, the level editor has so much potential to unlimitedly broaden the universe.  There are also hidden functions within the editor that are unlocked as the game progresses, along with various ways to show off your editing skills, like placing the piano keys gimmick to play a song of your choice.<br />
<br />
The developer of this game would be on cloud nine if players find such different ways to have fun!</div></div><br />
<div class="box">Explain the level editor in more detail, if you could.  How does one go about building a level?  What sorts of things can you do?  What sorts of parts can you build levels out of?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Mike Pepe, Marketing Director:</span>There are three difficulty levels in <i>MSK</i>'s editor.  The intermediate and expert levels allow for two axis design (x and y).  You honestly can do whatever you would like inside these levels, placing as many or few objects as you would like.  The game will not break if you make something totally outlandish.<br />
<br />
If you go back and find that you designed something that is impossibly hard to finish or too easy, you can go back to adjust it.  There are all sorts of ramps, turns, blocks as standard items to design levels.  On top of these there are also 40 gadgets such as cannons, shrinking machines, magnetizers, etc. that help spice things up a bit.</div></div><br />

<div class="box">What sharing features are available for levels we build ourselves?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Pepe:</span>You can share levels with your friends through WiiConnect24.  There are 20 slots to receive levels and an additional 20 to design your own.  You can delete these as they fill up.  There are also 20 additional levels that will be sent from Hudson at launch that are fixed.  All of these levels can be sent and received by going to the editor mode and clicking the connect button while your Wii is connected to the Internet.  If you have levels waiting for you they will be downloaded.  If not, start bugging your friends!</div></div><br />
<div class="box">On the topic of online features, what kinds of leaderboards are there?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Pepe:</span>The leaderboards are based on the speed with which you finish a level.  Your score is recorded based on the type of marble you have used.  We have leaderboards for states within the U.S., countries in Latin America, and Canada; and friend leaderboards as well.</div></div><br />

<div class="box">Is there anything else that you'd like to tell us about <i>Marble Saga</i>?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Pepe:</span>The game uses the Wii Balance Board and Miis!  In 30 of the levels, you can use the Balance Board to play.  These levels are different from the other levels in that they are board friendly; basically, you won't need a helmet to play them.<br />
<br />
Also, besides level design, you can design your own marble!  Throw your Mii in there and assign him or her sounds and attributes.  If you don't like how fast or slow it moves, how heavy or light it is, how responsive or unresponsive it is, etc. you can change them to suit your own play. Don't like the look of your Mii?  No problem, place a different fun head on there.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">Do you see a future for the franchise beyond <i>Marble Saga</i>?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Pepe:</span>In a word: heckyeah.  (New to Webster's dictionary.)</div></div><br />
<i>Marble Saga Kororinpa</i> is right around the corner, releasing on March 17 for a measly $30.  Veteran <i>Kororinpa</i> fans will definitely want to look into this, and if you haven't rolled marbles yet, why not?
