In <a href="http://news.com.com/Nintendo+on+the+latest+technical+divide/2010-1041_3-6180215.html">a perspective piece</a> published on CNET News.com, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime has a few words to offer regarding how he sees Nintendo, armed with Wii, addressing a microcosm of the "technical divide" that he thinks is appearing in homes across America.  Key quotes:<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Reggie Fils-Aime</span>...technology companies may not have the luxury of expanding product lines to address both audiences. I would suggest that for them, "smaller/cheaper/easier" is a far more likely road to riches, while "more of the same" eventually proves to be a dead-end street. It doesn't mean innovation stops--just that innovation turns to ideas like simple user interface and interactive experience rather than faster system speeds and feeds. The next generation of R&D should balance what's under the hood with what users want to hold in their hands.</div></div><br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Reggie Fils-Aime</span>A couple of years ago, we at Nintendo began to telegraph the nature of our new game console, the Wii, in terms identified by professor Christensen: "smaller, less expensive, easier to use." It is purposely so simple and intuitive that anyone in a household can use it... this is a conscious move into "white space"--in this case, that sizable gap between technophiles and technophobes where consumers just want an understandable way to catch up with the times.</div></div>
