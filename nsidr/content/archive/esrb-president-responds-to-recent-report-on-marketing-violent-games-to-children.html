<p>GameSpot has posted an interview with Entertainment Software Rating Board president Patricia Vance.  The interview was conducted to get Ms. Vance's thoughts on a recent <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2004/07/040708kidsviolencerpt.pdf">report</a> that was issued by the Federal Trade Commission titled "Marketing Violent Entertainment to Children: A Fourth Follow-up Review of Industry Practices in the Motion Picture, Music Recording & Electronic Game Industries."  An excerpt is below while the full interview can be found <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/07/09/news_6102312.html">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>GS: Does the fact that games now play a more prominent role in popular entertainment made the ESRB's job tougher?</b></p>

<p>PV: Entertainment licenses are not new to the videogame industry, and the ESRB has had cross-marketing guidelines in place for some time. These guidelines, which prohibit M-rated games from being target marketed to minors in third-party promotions and licensed merchandise will continue to be enforced.</p>
