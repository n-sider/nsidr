In light of the success of <i>Zoo Tycoon</i> for DS&mdash;especially ongoing UK success with the title still on the charts&mdash;THQ has <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/news/8326/1/Zoo_Tycoon_2_Coming_to_DS">announced a sequel</a>: <i>Zoo Tycoon 2</i>.<br />
<br />
The new game will feature improved gameplay and three game modes including standbys Zoo Designer and Zoo Director as well as an all-new Zookeeper mode where players can view and care for 3-D animals.  New animals and environments and a pervasive touchscreen interface make appearances as well as data exchange with friends who also own the title.<br />
<br />
Zoo Tycoon 2 is headed for an early 2008 release in Europe.
