<p>Again from N-Sider Samer, we've got a Famitsu story on Nintendo <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/06/07/103,1149650005,54463,0,0.html">showing Wii</a> to authorized distributors and analysts.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-06-07-japan_wii_demo.jpg" align="right" style="border: solid black 1px; padding: 1px; margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">In the meeting hall where the business briefing for said audience was being held, there was an "Experience Wii" corner where attendees ould try out <cite>Wii Sports Tennis</cite> and Remote Pointer Demo Shooting.  Famitsu says this is the first public of the Wii hardware in Japan.  In addition to the demonstration, the 12cm proprietary disc that Wii games will be distributed on (when distributed physically) was on display for the first time.</p>

<p>No additional information about the system seems to have been revealed, but Nintendo was criticized for the lack of titles with "non-gamer" appeal, save <cite>Wii Sports</cite> and <cite>Wario Ware: Smooth Moves</cite>.  Nintendo's E3 Wii showing had a similar heavy load of titles for gamers and very little for alternative audiences.</p>
