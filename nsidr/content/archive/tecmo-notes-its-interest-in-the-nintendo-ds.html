<p>During an interview on Tech TV, Tomonobu Itagaki, game producer for Tecmo's Team Ninja unit, who's responsible for such titles as <i>Dead or Alive</i> and <i>Ninja Gaiden</i>, commented on his interest in the Nintendo DS.</p> 

<p>Team Ninja announced its support of the DS at the recent E3 Expo. During the interview, Itagaki perhaps jokingly said that with the Nintendo DS' touch screen, gamers would finally have the opportunity to "touch" the Dead or Alive girls.</p>
