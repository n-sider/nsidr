<p>Taito's unique Nintendo DS RPG, <i>LostMagic</i>, will be appearing in North America in the second quarter of 2006, thanks to Ubisoft.</P>

<p>The title gives a unique, DS-centric take on role-playing games; you cast spells by drawing different patterns on the touch screen.  Up to three simple spells can be combined at one time to give more than 350 compound spells.  Combat also sees you directing squads of monsters to give an element of real-time strategy.</p>

<p>The game will also support the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for online duels.  Neither a rating nor  a price has yet been announced.</p>
