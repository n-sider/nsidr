<P>Welcome to the 3rd edition of Gamecube Connections.



<P>Hopefully you readers who still had some questions after reading the first two editions may find some answers below, although as always if you have any other queries, don't hesitate to send your questions to the usual address.



<P>Let the fun begin 



<HR>



<P><I>October 2nd, 2002 - Direct from </i><B>Mr. Civic:



<P>You printed my questions in the latest GCN connections article, and during the time I wrote that and now, I've found an alternative solution for those who want an S-video option.

It's not as good as an actual S-video cable, but I believe it's close.

I searched around and found a Composite to S-video converter from Tandy Australia.

It comes in cheap at AUS$10.95, and I think it's worth it. The converter gets rid off almost all the dot crawl(or 'ants' as I like to call them), and slightly sharpens the image. Pretty good, considering the price.

You can also convert S-video back to Composite - but what's the point?

 

<P>The downsides? 1. You need to buy or have a spare S-video cable to hook from the converter to your TV. 2. There's a crosshatching effect on the screen now. I guess it comes from processing the signal, but it's hardly noticeable. It only obvious on very bright colours like blue, red or green.

 

<P>I've attached both the picture of the converter and the back of the packaging so you can see how it works.(If I wasn't clear enough)

Hopefully it'll help those out there who are desperate for an S-video cable as I was.<BR>

<P>Thanks for the information Mr Civic, hopefully others in a similar situation find what they're looking for from this information.  So at least those hoping for an S-Video connection can breathe a little easier.  Here are the photo's Mr. Civic has sent in:<BR>

<P><I>September 30th, 2002 <B>From Gansura:</i>



<P>Mark,<BR>

In the time between my email to you about connecting

my cube to a laptop, I've found a solution.



<P>WinTV USB or another such device that allows

television connections to a computer through the USB

port works. WinTV comes with an S-Video input and for

audio I took a Y-connector and put the red and white

cables into the audio-in plug. The only drawback is

that these devices don't display more than 30 FPS.

This means that the graphics suffer a little on 60 FPS

game because you're seeing one frame of motion for

every two put out by the cube.



<P>These devices run for about 60 bucks.



<P>-Gansura</b>



<P>Thanks for the heads up, and this is something along the lines of what I was saying in response to your original question just below.  So, for those who are in a similar position to Gansura, his workable solution is something to be looked at.



<HR>



<P>From Gansura:

 

<P><b>

I really hope you can answer this. I have just come

into possesion of a top-of-the-line Dell

laptop/notebook. following this, I have no money for a

TV or external computer monitor. Would you know if it

is possible to hook the GCN to a laptop, for the use

of its LCD screen, and how it would be done?

If not could you point me in the direction of someone

who would?



I really appreciate this,

-Gansura</b></p>



<P>A: Since you cant afford a new external monitor, you can forget the VGA box(es).



<P>And the only way I can see you using the LCD monitor of the Dell, would be if the laptop had a TV-in port, in which case you could use the standard AV cable that came with the Gamecube (however youd still get no sound, unless u plug the red/white cables into a separate amp plus speakers).



<P>Without a TV, however, your options run really thin, Im sorry to say.



<HR>



<P>From Muiz Kassim:



<P><B>Hi,

I just recently read the GameCube Connections article and Readers' Responses.  I really found them helpful, so thanks a lot.  But I still have a question for you.  I know that the PAL GameCubes will work with component cables, but will they still be able to send out a progressive scan signal?  I'd be really appreciative if you could answer.  Thanks again for the great article.

Muiz Kassim</b></p>



<P>A: As far as I know, yes theyll still send out a progressive scan signal.  Obviously your TV will need to accept Progressive Scan, along with the game having been coded with it too.

Cover all those bases and you should be fine.



<HR>



<P>From Lionel Steamer:



<P><B>Ok, I'm Getting a Home Theather System, But I want It

to be compatible with my Game Cube...



I'm a total Dumbass so please Explain a little to me



Q: Do I need Special Cables? I mean The GC only have the

A/V Cables....</b></p>



<P>A: In terms of cables, the standard AV cable is enough to get surround sound out of the Gamecube.  You dont need special cables to get surround sound.



<P><B>Q: I also Want to know about the Pro Logic II thing...



If I get a System compatible with Pro Logic, but no

Pro Logic II, would I be able to Play Eternal Darkness

& Rogue Leader in Surround?</b></p>



<P>A: Yes, if the system <I>DOES NOT</i> have PLII, those games (and any Pro-Logic II games) would still run in  normal Pro Logic.



<P><B>Q: My Brother is a Sony (Nintendo-Hater) Fanboy, and he

has been telling me that Real Surround isn't possible

with GC, that Only two exits of sound are avilable..

Is This for Real?

</b></p>



<P>A: The two exits that hes talking about are the red and white parts of the cable, which equates to left and right speaker.  His definition of Real Surround seems like true discrete 5.1 surround sound, such as Dolby Digital AC3 5.1, or DTS 5.1.



<P>Gamecubes highest surround sound capability is Pro-Logic II.  The bottom line is that PL2 isnt as technically good as AC3/DTS 5.1, no matter which way the cheese is cut.



<P>However, that doesnt mean that PS2 is any better, yes it supports AC3 and DTS 5.1, in movies.  It can support them theoretically via software code in games, but by doing so, developers would have to sacrifice other things like graphics, level size, etcand what would you prefer?  A game with incredible 5.1 sound, or one with good sound but massive levels, fantastic graphics, etc.your brother would be lying if he said he preferred better soundhehe



<P>Currently the highest that Ive heard out of PS2 is DTS 4.0 in one or two games that have already been released.



<P>In reality, its quite well known, but in the surround sound stakes, Xbox is king in that regard, when talking about in-game sound.



<P>In practical terms, we dont even need true surround sound like DTS 5.1 in our games, because when you compare something like Rogue Leader to anything else on other machines, sound-wise theres absolutely nothing to complain about, because youll be more interested in playing the game to really notice that Xbox games have better surround sound definition, or that Gamecubes games dont sound as good as PS2, or whatever.



<P>And I dont think we even need to bother to talk about GCs lack of a digital-out (and hence real surround) as some sort of negative. 



<HR>



<P>From Rowan Wiggington:



<P><B>I was thinking about getting a VGA connection, but first can you tell me 

which port the VGA box goes into on the 'Cube and where the VGA port on the 

monitor is?



Also, will I need any extra components to make the resolution higher or will 

it already be high?



Is the VGA available in Australia?



Rowan Wiggington

</b></p>



<P>A: The VGA port on the monitor is where it plugs into the back of your computer.  I.e. the cable that comes out of the back of your monitor (which goes to the back of the PC).



<P>The VGA box would plug into the gamecube via a cable that comes with the VGA box.



<P>As far as resolution goes, I cant honestly tell you because I dont have first-hand experience with VGA boxes.



<P>And in terms of availability, I havent seen any in shops myself, but there are various online stores that would have VGA boxes available to Australia.



<HR>



<P>From Eduardo:



<P><B>Hi, i am an avid reader of your site, it is awesome!! I have a 29" Sony Wega tv (it is under NTSC format, I live in latin america) with a component video input, but I don't have the component video cables for my Gamecube. The thing is that using the standard a/v cables the image displayed does not fit the screen completely. What I mean is that the lateral (left and right) borders are not filled completely, it is like if the image is round inwards on those borders but the tv's are straight. It doesn't happen when connectig it to a regular tv, or when using my N64 on that same Wega with standard a/v connections. I once read in a forum that the problem was that the GC is sending a signal for a regular tv, but the tv isn't one so that is why that happens. Am I right?? Will using component cables solve the situation?? Thank you, this connection section is of great help, keep up the good work and the surprises. Eduardo</b></P>



<P>A: Hmm, very intriguing question, and one that I cant fully answer myself.  I would put the display not quite fitting as some sort of quirk with the TV and GC, so I can only give advice on this one.  



<P>I would advise you to try out the component cable, if you cant rent one, then before you buy it, make sure that youll be able to return the component cable if it doesnt improve your situation.



<HR>



<P>From Mr Civic:



<P><B>Hi

Great article you've got here, specially for people who aren't up to the minute when it comes to GCN connections.

I know what the difference and how all the connections work, so my question is why do you think Nintendo removed the S-video output, out of the PAL GameCube?

I find it ridiculous that Nintendo thinks Composite and Component are the only options you can have to hook up your GCN. Sure S-video isn't as good as Component(but it's close), but am I wrong in saying that S-video is more widely used(at least here in Aus) and available than Component?

I've heard that Nintendo's second batch of PAL GameCubes will output S-video. Is that true, or just wishful thinking? And could Nintendo somehow "fix" the current GameCubes and allow them to output S-video?

Lastly, could Nintendo manufacture an S-video cable using the Digital Out for the PAL market?

 

Thanks.

</b></p>



<P>A: Im totally bewildered as to why Nintendo opted to remove S-Video capability from our PAL Gamecubes, and the only reason that I can think of would be that they wanted to promote the Component connection.  Yes thats a pretty weak reason, but its all I can think of.  That removal just completely boggles my mind.  And I totally agree with you on your ridiculous comment.



<P>I would agree that S-Video is more widely used than Component here in Oz (and dare I say it Europe, where SCART naturally takes precedence).  The amount of TVs that do not have Component inputs FAR OUTWEIGH the amount that have S-Video inputs, major sigh!



<P>As far as Nintendo fixing the later batches of PAL Gamecubes, well thats news to me, and I dont really believe it, but you just never know with Nintendo!  I honestly dont think Nintendo would fix the current GCs, but I wouldnt put it past some smart cookie to come up with an unofficial way of enabling S-Video from current cubes, provided it was technically possible in the first place.



<P>Lastly, I would say no to your last question, but again, you never know.  I was (and still am) under the impression that the Digital AV Out was for the component cable, and only the component cable.



<P>But hey, we can all dream!
