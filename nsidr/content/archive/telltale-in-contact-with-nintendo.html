<p>Telltale Games, recently best-known for their downloadable adventure games based on the Bone comic and the reviving of Sam & Max, <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/blogs/telltale/?permalink=5C476F0230B7702324F4A0CB0331A31F.txt&smm=y">posted back on September 14</a> a plea for fans to let Nintendo know they were interested in possibly bringing their games to Wii.</p>

<p>According to a story at 1UP, the pestering seems to have paid off.  Telltale's Emily Morganti <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3153720">says</a> "They took notice! We got a phone call from Nintendo this afternoon. We'll take it from here&mdash;please don't email them anymore!"</p>

<p>This is clearly just the beginnings and may not even result in Telltale becoming a licensed Nintendo developer, but nonetheless, it's an encouraging start.  If we hear more, we'll definitely let you know.</p>
