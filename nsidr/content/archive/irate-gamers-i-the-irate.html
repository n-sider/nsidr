<h3>Irate Gamers</h3>

<p>Are you happy?</p>

<p>...yes?</p>

<p>::Calmly stands up and slaps you across the face::</p>

<p>Are you happy?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  You!  Yeah, you!  The one whos happy and
he knows it... I suggest you stop clapping your hands!  I know where you live!</p>  

<p>A wise monkey once said...</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/cranport.jpg" width="134" height="132"
align="right">Gamers, these are the men and women of the industrial world who find
pleasure in a just recently-developed past-time.  The origin of gamers and games dates
back only a few years, beginning with the simple days of Pong.  Video games were fun
back then.  Enjoyment was easily acquired.  Today, however, we rarely find these joyful
moments out of simplicity.  Instead, were given interactive movies and bloated forms of
novels.</p>

<p>Yet...days of simplicity are not fully lost.  Nintendo and Sega are some of the original
pioneers of this industry.  So long as Nintendo and Sega continue their purpose of
upholding the values of this industry, fun entertainment in the form of video games,
will continue to flourish.  Well, wed like to think Nintendo and Sega can hold their own,
but the fact is, they cant.  Fanboys, and their purchase of games for no other reason than
<i>Its James Bond!</i> or <i>It has awesome graphics!</i> may just put an end to
these past decades of fun entertainment.  Recently, we seem to have lost sight of what
is important...</p>

<p>Video games...aren't they supposed to be about fun and entertainment?  I would
assume so, since even the word "game", which is part of the word Video <i>Games</i>,
has the meaning playing something for amusement.  Yet...each time you sit down with
your Nintendo, or Sega, or PlayStation, or Xbox, can you genuinely say youre
experiencing this embodiment of fun and entertainment?  ...or is this experience simply a
graphical high -- eye-candy and nothing more?  You know, something similar to seeing
Britneys polygons.  The answers are likely split between both, but well pretend that you
chose the second option.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I once said this:</p> 

<p><font size="-1">Video games are no longer as simple as they were in the days of
Pong.  The Internet has grown to astronomical proportions, Digital Versatile Disks are
quickly replacing video cassettes, and <i>because of improving graphics, gaming will be
altered forever</i>.</font></p>

<p>Now wait a minute...because of improving graphics, gaming will be altered forever? 
I should be placed in a pen of rabid albino penguins for that comment.  On second
thought, well just allow Segas Mizuguchi to slap me around.</p>

<p><font size="-1">"Hey, just because games are realistic doesn't mean they're
necessarily fun. Games these days have a tendency to devote themselves to realism in
everything down to the graphics and music," President of Sega's United Game Artists,
Tetsuya Mizuguchi, worries, "I've developed a few racing games myself, too, so I imagine
that if I kept that up they'd get more and more realistic, but I was afraid that realism
would end up being emphasized more than fun."</font></p>

<p>Realism does not equate to a fun game.  Tetsuya Mizuguchi is very wise in saying
that.  This is another factor a great majority of game developers need to realize. 
Simulations...Playing a racing sim such as <i>Gran Turismo</i>, is that considered fun? 
Unless you are totally obsessed with cars and get a kick out of seeing them composed of
polygons, then sure, you may find it cool, but fun?  Are you really going to sit down
and have a smile form on your face because it's "such a fun game"?  I haven't seen it
happen and I guarantee it hasn't occurred while I've played.</p>

<p>Now take a look at titles coming out of Nintendo and Sega: games such as
<i>Pikmin, Animal Crossing</i> and <i>Super Monkey Ball</i>.  These are games
aiming at, not graphical prowess, nor brand-named connoisseurs (Each of these are new
ideas), but gamers and monkeys looking for something fresh, fun and entertaining.</p> 

<p>This brings us to the next point.  While the small list of above games are not
brand-named franchise titles, it is becoming a more frequent phenomenon in this industry
where developers rely on their known characters and franchises to build a game.  Taking
it back to the previous topic, and the only aspect of the sequel developers seem to focus
on, is the graphics.  Developers believe they only have to tweak the visuals for it to
warrant a buy.  Lets play the same game, for a fifth, sixth, seventh time!  Sounds like
fun.  Damn...I know I cant wait.</p>

<p>So, is not having fun what you want?  Well, developers seem to think so.  Our
continual purchasing of their games suffering from the Rehash Syndrome, must have
inadvertently given them this impression.</p>

<p>Here's an example.  Do we necessarily need an enhanced <i>Tomb Raider</i> every
holiday season?</p>

<p>Well, Core and Eidos believe we do.</p> 

<p><i>"Hey, I've got an idea, lets slaps some larger breasts on Lara and give her a couple
new outfits."</i></p>

<p>*five minutes later*</p>

<p><i>"New product completed.  Ship it!"</i></p>

<p>While exaggerated, this little scenario is not far from the truth.  This occurrence
happens with many games - Twisted Metal, Crash Bandicoot, Turok, Final Fantasy,
Madden, movie licenses and the list goes on.  The simple purpose for these re-hashes is to
garner money.  Giving the consumer "fun" is only second priority.  They draw you in with
the familiar name and the pretty graphics.  Even if they dont deserve it, these small
improvements ultimately lead to sales.  These software titles sell, and they sell well.  It's
as simple as that.  Why?  Usually, it's a result of the first title in the series being an
undeniable hit.  In its original form, it was probably a fresh, new concept.  Then after
drawing upon the grand success of the first title or the success of a hit movie, additional
software is created.  The fun is ultimately lost.  As more and more of these sequels are
released, people grab onto these brand names and cant let go.  Developers have sedated
their broncos; they wont buck you off.  All the while, you just continue blindly riding
these franchises.  When in reality, you already own the original game!  Its a conspiracy, I
tell ya!  Or maybe just good marketing...</p>

<p>So, who the hell purchases these same games, with the only cosmetic change being a
new number attached to the name - also likened to the Rehash Syndrome.</p>

<p>Fanboys</p>

<p>A general term used to describe an uneducated male or female gamer.  An overly
enthusiastic admirer who believes him/herself to be an expert on his/her veneration yet is
still blinded by a veil of ignorance.  Lets see, we have our Nintendo fanboys, Sony
fanboys, Sega fanboys, and most recently, Microsoft fanboys.  If I had a boiling pit of soy
sauce next to me, Id throw you all in there right now, especially you Sony and Microsoft
fanboys.  Damn, dirty fanboys...</p>

<p>Both Microsoft and Sony are viewed as tyrants who are assaulting an industry that is
not truly intended for them to possess.  While it's not exactly their fault that third-party
developer's main goal is the production of sequels, nonetheless, it is Sony's and
Microsoft's fault for encouraging the games to appear on their consoles. Also, I don't
think there is a need to point out that Sony and Microsoft are guilty of the rehash
syndrome.  I suppose that was predictable since the primary reason for their presence in
this industry is of course, money.  Lead by example...</p>

<p>Sure, both Sony and Microsoft can develop video games, but I don't simply want
"video games". It's a rare event when I actually receive a game that is more than a
<i>game</i>, but is an <i>experience</i>. Neither Sony nor Microsoft has been able to
provide me with such experiences and I'm reluctant to say they ever will. When the main
driving force behind your company is wealth, providing a <i>fun gaming experience</i>
isn't going to be your top priority. You simply want to provide a horde of
wealth-garnering video games.  Sure, you're going to say that Nintendo is guilty of just
this, using brand-names and such, but Nintendo at least has the innovative, quality
software to back them up.  These interactive movies and bloated forms of
novels...Nintendo will have no part of them.</p>

<p><i>"It might be quality, but it's too damn short"</i> are a lot of responses lately,
referring to Nintendo's initial, rather short-lengthed GameCube games.  That's a little
bullying there, don't you think?  <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, arguably one of the best video
games of all time, contained just a little over 3 hours of gameplay.  <i>Devil May Cry</i>
is another very short title that is receiving much acclaim.  Nintendo's <i>Luigi's
Mansion</i> and <i>Pikmin</i> contain about the same amount of gameplay as the
formerly mentioned games.  Yet, Nintendo is somehow held to a different standard?  One
in which, whenever Nintendo tries to accomplish something new, people view it as BAD
and people turn to saying that Nintendo is 'forgetting about its fans'.  (Take a look at
<i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> boys and girls.  How dare you even think that Nintendo
is forgetting about you.  You're the reason Nintendo has included all of those unknown
characters and over 300 trophies.  Really, who else is remotely going to appreciate the Ice
Climbers?)  People, fanboys in particular, just cant give Nintendo a break...</p>

<p>Also, do you understand just <i>why</i> Nintendo will delay a gaming experience by
months, a year, or even two years? Quality: it not only makes the consumers happy, but
also makes the creators behind the experience proud.  If it takes Nintendo two years to
make a fun product, thats exactly how much time theyll take.  We all know crap sells.
With Nintendo being such a large publisher/developer, it could easily poop out 100+
<i>Supermans, Tomb Raiders,</i> and <i>South Parks</i> a year and in the process,
make an outrageous profit. ...but does it? No, not at all. This is the difference I discern
between Sega and Nintendo - and - Microsoft and Sony. In fact, this is the exact meaning
of <i>"The Nintendo Difference."</i>  Kids, its all about the fun.</p>

<p>In these next years you're going to see an onslaught of titles coming out of
developers.  Just take a look at some of these games: such as <i>Simpson's Wresting</i>,
<i>Simpson's Road Rage</i>, <i>Simpson's Skateboarding</i>...<i>Simpson's Damn
This Is Getting Ridiculous</i>.  This is exactly what we don't want, what we don't need. 
It's up to you to decide where youre going to place your entertainment money so you
dont give publishers the wrong impression -- that you prefer crappy software.  Just be
careful of your purchases -- watch out for those flaming piles of ****.  Read a few
reviews before you buy anything and most importantly, don't fall for the brand name.  Just
because it's labeled with something such as "James Bond" doesn't necessarily mean it's
going to be a fantastic gaming experience.  One last thing, don't fall for the beautiful
graphics.  Regardless of what one tells you, alone, graphics can not make a game great
nor make it fun.  I know I said that was my last comment...but Im not done!  Have more
faith in Nintendo and Sega.  Truth be told...you can rarely go wrong.</p>

<p>I leave you with a quote from Capcom Flagship's, Shinji Mikami:</p>

<p><font size="-1">"I'm tired of this very conservative industry.  I would like to make
crazy things -- and this is one hell of an example [referring to Brain Box, a robot
simulation in development for the Xbox].  The advantage of being famous is you can
come up with crazy projects, and people will be curious about them.  I really think the
industry needs more fun!  I think that is what videogames are about."</font></p>

<p>At least some individuals in this industry still realize the importance of fun.  And to
that I say, Amen.</p>
