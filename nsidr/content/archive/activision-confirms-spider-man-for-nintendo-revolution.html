<p>Activision has informed <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/698/698014p1.html">IGN.com</a> about its plans to bring a version of Spider-Man 3 to Nintendo's next-generation console codenamed Revolution.  The game will be built specifically around the capabilities and features of the console.  Activision previously said it intends to bring at least one title to market during the first four months of the console's release.  It's suspected this may be one of the first Revolution games to arrive out of the company.  More info will likely be divulged at the E3 Expo in May.</p>
