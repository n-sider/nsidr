<p>In an interview with Wired.com, Nintendo producer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=6">Eiji Aonuma</a> said that while he doesn't feel voice dialogue is a good fit for the Zelda series... "That said, I've always felt that if we can use voice in a way that's new and unique, it could be very positive for the Zelda series. Unfortunately, we weren't able to do that in time for the E3 demo, but we do have some ideas that we're thinking about." 

<p>Aonuma also discussed the upcoming Zelda title for the Nintendo DS. He said the game will be "primarily controlled with the system's touch screen and stylus pen."</p>
