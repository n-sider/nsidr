Alongside its own voluminous content, Nintendo was <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/791/791016p1.html">showing two third-party titles</a> at the media summit behind held this week: Ubisoft's <i>Jam Session</i> and THQ's <i>Drawn to Life</i>.<br />
<br />
Only the former was playable, IGN reports: the latter title was presented only in a hands-off fashion.  IGN's Craig Harris notes that THQ has yet to let them play the game at all, which is slated for release in September.<br />
<br />
Jam Sessions, a guitar simulation game, has already seen release in Japan as <i>Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06</i>, and has been featured in Nintendo Power's latest issue here.  Jam Sessions is also set to hit stores this September.
