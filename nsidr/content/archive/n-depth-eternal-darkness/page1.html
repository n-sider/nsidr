<H3>N-Depth: Eternal Darkness</H3>



<center><p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/edndepth.jpg"></center>  



<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to possibly the most expansive N-Sider in-depth features ever created.  At your fingertips now rests a plethora of information and secrets that you wished you had before now.  The biggest point of interest comes in the form of the entire un-cut Eternal Darkness script.  We locked ourselves in a dark room and were slid meals under the door on a weekly basis, youre right.  The script can be downloaded from N-Sider, but we ask one giant favor for all this work weve put in:  Do not link to the file.  This thing took a disturbing amount of time to transcribe, and we would appreciate it if nobody linked to the file itself.  



<p>Next we offer you the Secrets and Links page, which hosts a list of things you may not have noticed in Eternal Darkness.  Only visit this page if you have already beaten the game three times since it gives away the secrets of this deep story.  After that, take a hop over to the entire staff list, and perhaps glance at the totals for the credits.  Finally, make sure you read our Eternal Darkness review, filled with our own opinions of the game and an overview of the gameplay system.  



<p>So go grab yourself a big cup of hot chocolate, put your feet up, and have fun reading.  We want people to send their own secrets in the story to <A HREF="Mailto:jason@n-sider.com">me</A> and well update if there are a lot that we havent found ourselves.  Enjoy!
