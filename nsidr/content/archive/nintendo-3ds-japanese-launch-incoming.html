The <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/3ds/index.html" target="_blank">Nintendo 3DS</a> arrives on Japanese shores on February 26, 2011.  The unit will be available in two colors&#8212;Cosmo Black and Aqua Blue&#8212;for Â¥25,000.  Nintendo initially announced the handheld in March 2010 and formally unveiled the device three months later at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.<br />
<br />
It's been reported that only 400,000 units will be available for the Japanese launch.  Nintendo officially stated its intent to ship over 4 million units over the next year.  About 1.5 million of those will be allocated to Japan.<br />
<br />
The Japanese launch will be accompanied by eight games including the Nintendo-published <i>Nintendogs + Cats</i>, which will be available in three different versions (the toy poodle version is pictured below).<br />
