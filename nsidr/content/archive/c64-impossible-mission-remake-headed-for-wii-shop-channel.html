A remake of the Commodore 64 title <i>Impossible Mission</i>, in the works for Nintendo DS as well as Sony's PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, will be the first non-Nintendo original (and I have to confess, I am using the word "original" a bit loosely here&mdash;it is a remake, after all) software to hit the Wii Shop Channel.<br />
<br />
Nintendo UK <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=76000">confirmed the title is on its way</a>, which was first revealed in the pages of the official Nintendo Power magazine.  <i>Impossible Mission</i> is being developed by System 3, and will include both the remade game and a "retro mode" for those who wish to play the classic as it originally appeared.  (No word on if Wii owners will need to type LOAD "*",8,1 to start the retro edition.)<br />
<br />
Nintendo has already brought some original content to the Wii Shop, including the <i>Internet Channel</i> and the <i>Everybody Votes Channel</i>.  The number of titles available through the Wii Shop's Virtual Console service, which carries emulated titles from the bygone NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, and TurboGrafx 16 consoles, currently dwarfs the Wii Ware section where the original titles live.  Impossible Mission is expected to debut this summer.
