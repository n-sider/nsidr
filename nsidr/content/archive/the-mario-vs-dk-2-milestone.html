<p>Apparently the sheer number of announced games at E3 found <cite>Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis</cite> slipping under our news radar.  That omission gets corrected now, because <cite>Mario vs. DK 2</cite> is going to be a key title in Nintendo's history for one very important reason &mdash; beyond the puzzle/platformer gameplay the original <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=640"><cite>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</cite></a> possessed.</p>

<p><cite>Mario vs. DK 2</cite> will come with a level editor, allowing players to create their own maps.  As if this isn't enough, though, the title will also let players share created maps on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Nintendo says, in a separate point, that players will be able to "use Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to download maps created by others," suggesting Nintendo will be hosting created maps rather than simply letting folks trade maps by connecting to each other.</p>

<p>The title also seems to have changed up the gameplay considerably, now having players guide the Mini Marios with the touch screen rather than playing the game as Mario directly.  <cite>Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis</cite> releases September 25, 2006 and has not yet been rated by the ESRB.</p>
