<p>Hey everyone. I just thought I'd give you all a heads up on what's ahead. As most of you have probably noticed, some E3 game impressions have already begun to trickle in over the past days since E3 2005 ended. There is a lot more to come. You'll be seeing many more shorter impressions, in the form of a news post, as well as quite a few larger articles on the many games at Nintendo's booth. We are also aiming to provide a few N-Depths on games like Animal Crossing DS, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and perhaps a few other games like Battalion Wars. We'll also have a few interviews with people like Tom Harlin and Denis Dyack up in the coming days.

<p>When will these mythical articles arrive? In the next few weeks. Our E3 team was pushed pretty hard this year and is working very hard to finish up our E3 content. We've never believed in sacrificing quality for timeliness, but we're doing our best to strike a balance between the two. So while other sites may have moved on from E3, the E3 party at N-Sider is just beginning.

<p>Here are a few links to our first batch of impressions:
