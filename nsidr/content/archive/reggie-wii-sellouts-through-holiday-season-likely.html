Speaking to the San Jose Mercury News in early September, NOA president Reggie Fils-Aime said Wii is likely to be sold out through the holiday season.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>"We have been sold out worldwide since we launched ... Every time we put more into the marketplace, we sell more, which says that we are not even close to understanding where the threshold is between supply and demand."</li>
  <li>"What I can tell you is that typically, our inventory is lasting a day ... I don't think we will know when supply crosses with demand till after the holiday season."</li>
  <li>Asked about competition from Microsoft's <i>Halo 3</i>: "I think that the "Halo 3" consumer already has the hardware, because they're playing "Bioshock" and "Crackdown" and a variety of games that are, in the end, quite similar: first-person shooter experience, multiplayer capable online. Tell me what's new?"</li>
  <li>Sees no reason to counter Halo 3 in any way</li>
  </ul><br />
