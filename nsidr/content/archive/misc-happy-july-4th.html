<P>Happy Independence Day to all of our American readers on America's 230th Birthday.  Independence Day marks the day when the United States first declared their independence from English control. Being a non-religious holiday, the 4th of July is one of the few holidays celebrated by nearly all American citizens and the United States as a whole.

The N-Sider staff would like to wish all Americans a safe evening of celebrations and remind you all to avoid driving or setting off fireworks while under the influence of any substances including your Nintendo DS.</p>
