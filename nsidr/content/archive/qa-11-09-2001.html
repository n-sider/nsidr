<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Eric:</i> Its a toughie, Capcom is close buddies with Nintendo, though Sony has that One Year exclusivity arrangement with DMC. After that, who knows?<br>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b> <br>
Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I enjoy RPG games, so I was wondering what your prognosis is for the genre on GameCube, or at least what the future of
RPG looks like in the coming year for GameCube.  On a related note, do you think there will be any chance Square will hook up with
GameCube, or is there still some soreness between Square &amp; Nintendo over the whole N64 / PSX thing?  In any case, I'm still going do the 'cube with my free time.  Just curious.<br>
<br>
<i>S. Wong</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:<br>
</b><i>Brenden:</i> I should remind you that there's a lot more to RPGs than what Square has. There's been talk of DQVIII for GameCube, we've got PSO:V2, Skies of Arcadia 1 and 2, and there's bound to be some Atlus support down the road. We can't forget about Nintendo's internal teams either. So basically, I would give the GameCube a much better prognosis than the N64 for the RPG genre.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b> <br>
Is there a Pilotwings sequel in the works for the GameCube?<br>
<br>
<i>BadBoy Inc.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Brenden: </i> Not that I've heard of. Be nice if there was though.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> These are such stupid questions.&nbsp;<br>
<i>Dean:</i> hey Pilotwings rocks, I want another sequel.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b> <br>
Is there any Harvest Moon game from Natsume planned for the GameCube ?I have heard rumors that there is development on one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i>WeirdManz</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Brenden:</i> I can't recall anything solid, but Natsume has always been a good supporter of Nintendo. There's bound to be one in development, either now, or sometime in the near future.<br>
<i>Brent:</i> What's with all the "is X coming to GameCube?" questions?</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Question:</b> <br>
Any word on the ED delay? I mean was it to clean up the characters' polys or something? Sure
wasn't to clean up the frame rate.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Answer:</b><i><br>
Glen:</i> Straight from the horse's mouth: "We had an opportunity to make ED better so we, along with Nintendo, decided to take the time to take ED to a higher level." - Denis Dyack</font></p>
