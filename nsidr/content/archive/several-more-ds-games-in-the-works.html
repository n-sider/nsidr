<p>The first is <i>Naruto: Saikyo Ninja Daikesshu 3</i> which is thus far only scheduled to release in Japan.  Developd by Tomy and set for an April 21 release, the game is based on a Japanese anime and comic.

<p>Japanese developer Starfish has a pinball game in development for the Nintendo DS called <i>Devilish</i>.  The title is said to be an enhanced port a classic 1991 Genesis pinball game. The DS version will have touch screen and multiplayer support.
