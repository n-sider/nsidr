A report from <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article2056279.ece">TimesOnline</a> indicates Japanese television audiences are choosing to spend more time playing Wii.<br />
<br />
The report says that for the first time in two decades, no television show was able to attract more than a 9 percent audience share last week.  "The quality of programming has always been a little cyclical in Japan, but there has never been a period of decline like the one we are seeing now. There are outside factors at work. One is people watching TV on their cell phones where we can't track them, but the really big factor is the time people are spending on the Wii," an executive of TBS told TimesOnline.<br />
<br />
As the Wii continues to strengthen its software library, the impact on television broadcasts may grow.  It was noted however that they've noticed no impact on certain types of programming such as major sports events.
