<p><i>Welcome to N-Data.</i></p>

<p>What exactly is N-Data? It's the solution to world hunger, the cure for cancer, the answer to "Is there life on other planets?", and a remedy for bad breath.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe it isn't any of the above...it is however, something that's been years in the making and also something that would not have been possible without the inspiration and help of so many <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/n-database-thanks">people</a>.</p>

<p><i>Nintendo</i> is the undeniable theme here.  As the name suggests, N-Data is a comprehensive catalog of Nintendo related information and data.  Just as Nintendo isn't your traditional game company, we don't expect to be your traditional documentary.  At a time when there's a lot of animosity towards Nintendo, this is when people most need to be reminded of exactly who Nintendo is and what they stand for.</p>

<p>There are four main elements of N-Data.</p>

<p><ul>

<li><b>Company Profiles</b><br>
An indepth list of companies that have worked alongside Nintendo on its large catalog of published games over years past<br>

<li><b>Employee Profiles</b><br>
A comprehensive list of employees, with pictures and backgrounds, of whom currently work or were previously employed by Nintendo<br>

<li><b>Game Profiles</b><br>
A list of games containing detailed information on employee credits, sales, release dates, screens and more<br>

<li><b>Hardware Profiles</b><br>
A detailed history and thorough look at the hardware and peripherals released by Nintendo

  </ul></p>

<p>And tied to these are smaller sections including Nintendo's Financial History, Nintendo's Movie & Cartoon History, Nintendo's Marketing History, and Nintendo's Interview History, among others, that will be arriving in the coming days.  We've only just begun uploading the vast depths of information, so expect things to exponentially expand in the coming days and months.  We hope this to become an invaluable resource for both readers and other gaming media.</p>

<p>Info is constantly being misplaced on the web. Time has a tendency to deteriorate the things we most cherish.  We hope to preserve Nintendo's rich history and archive it for the years to come.  Info by itself can be pretty dull.  As such, we hope to achieve something that is more than a catalog of Nintendo's past - you, the gamers, are as much a part of that past.</p>

<p>In two weeks, with the launch of N-Universe, we'll reveal just how you can participate in this journey.</p>

<p>Until then, take a look around.  Things might look a bit bare, however in the coming weeks we hope you'll find them blossom into something extraordinary.</p>
