So where does this leave Nintendo and Wii's appeal to the Blue Ocean?  Well, it's definitely worth noting that Nintendo, as of the time I'm writing this editorial, has not even revealed the console's price.  Current rumors range from $170 to $230; all Nintendo's said is that it's going to be under $250.  At those prices, I don't see Blue Ocean buyers first in line anyway; but launch time <i>is</i> one of those times that game systems will be getting mass media coverage, and I can't help but wonder where on the map Nintendo could put Wii if they could say to the Blue Ocean, "Wii is our new system, it's for everyone, and to prove it: this is what we have for <i>you</i>."  Even if they don't pick one up at launch, it may be the seed that gets them to keep a closer eye on the system as it develops further.<br />
<br />
Those who have been following Wii since its Revolution days are also well aware that Nintendo has been keeping secrets close to their vest since the system was first spoken of.  It is certainly conceivable that Nintendo is actually getting ready to unleash a tide of announcements of precisely the types of games they need to have to sell Wii to the Blue Ocean.  There's word that a <i>Wii Motor Sports</i> <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2282">may even be a reality</a>, and of course EAD may be at this moment busy adding new games to <i>Wii Music</i> to make it a real title.  Miyamoto also said he's <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/720/720121p1.html">working on productizing</a> <i>Remote Pointer Demo</i>.  Bloomberg has even reported Nintendo is working on <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2348">diet software</a>, though no mention is made of release plans.  The great thing about these types of games is that they are things that small teams can build quickly.<br />
<br />
But we remain today with no announcements made.  A lot of people expected a lot of things out of the Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany.  Nintendo trotted out sequels to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=992"><i>Super Mario Strikers</i></a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=912"><i>Battalion Wars</i></a>.  The reaction has been pretty positive, but it's been positive in precisely the wrong place Nintendo needs to be getting positive reaction from.  Neither title will expand Wii's Blue Ocean presence one whit.<br />
<br />
The ball is in Nintendo's court.  Time will tell if they plan to follow through with their Blue Ocean strategy in time for Wii's launch and the 2006 holiday season, or if they plan to pull out all the stops next year, after the console launches and becomes a hopeful hit amongst existing console gamers... or even if Blue Ocean is simply all talk.  As of today, I've yet to see Nintendo committing themselves to this so-called Blue Ocean strategy.  Here's hoping they put their software where their mouth is--before someone else does.<br />
