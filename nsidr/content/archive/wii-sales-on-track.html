At a recent Reuters Media Summit in New York, Nintendo of America President <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> told <a href="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a> that sales of the Nintendo Wii were on track to sell 4 million units globally before December 31st. Fils-Aime said Nintendo will sell every unit they are able to build; currently sales of the Wii are simply a matter of manufacturing.<br />
<br />
This news comes after Nintendo's recent <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2535">announcement</a> that they had sold all 600,000 of the available launch units within the first week.<br />
<br />
Fils-Aime also said that sales of the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance systems were also strong and are selling as expected.
