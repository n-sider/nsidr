The official Japanese <i>Donkey Kong Jet</i> <a href="http://wii.com/jp/articles/dktj/">website</a> was recently updated with some brand new gameplay videos and TV commercials. To view them, just click the images at the bottom of the page or the one to the right of the control explanation.<br />
<br />
The videos again confirm that the Wii remote and nunchuck replace the bongo controller originally planned before the game shifted from GameCube to Wii. The controls are pretty simple: shake the Wii remote and nunchuk up and down to do things. Alternating quickly will gain you speed at the start of a race. Shaking the remote or the nunchuk alone will turn you right or left, respectively; and quickly lifting both the nunchuk and remote makes you jump.<br />
<br />
Players begin every race with the barrel jets strapped to their feet, but progressing through the levels and into different environments gives opportunities for different modes of transportation. For example, going underwater gives players Enguarde the swordfish. Rambi the rhinoceros is also present, as are mine carts, toboggans, and barrel cannons.<br />
<br />
Barrel cannons have multiple purposes. Some give a temporary speed boost, others blast players onto sleds, and still others shoot players high into the air. While airborne, prompts appear on screen; following the directions will get you to perform tricks and earn bananas. Collecting bananas fills up a bar on the side of the screen allowing for temporary invincibility and extra speed.<br />
<br />
Also present are weapons, as in Mario Kart. One of the videos shows DK tossing a barrel behind him, presumably a trap, and shooting what looks like a bazooka.<br />
<br />
DK Jet is set for a Japanese release just over one week from today, on June 28. It was originally planned for a release this year in America, but it has curiously vanished from the NOA press site.
