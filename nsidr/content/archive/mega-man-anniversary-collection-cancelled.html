<P>The oft-delayed Mega Man Anniversary Collection for the GBA, intended to include the original Game Boy versions of the blue bomber's portable adventures, has reportedly (finally) been cancelled.  One N-Sider tipster referred us to this letter he allegedly recieved, notifying him that his pre-order had been cancelled:</p>

<blockquote>
<i><P>Capcom U.S.A., Inc.<br>
475 Oakmead Parkway<br>
Sunnyvale, CA 94085</P>

<P>Dear Valued Customer,</P>

<P>Enclosed please find a refund check for your order of Megaman Anniversary Collection for the Game Boy Advance through our CAPCOM online store. This game has been placed on indefinite hold. We appreciate your continued support of CAPCOM products and appreciate your business.</P>

<P>Thank you,</P>

<P>CAPCOM Customer Service<br>
408-774-0400<br>

</blockquote>

<P>The game has also disappeared from numerous release lists, including GameStop, as well as Capcom's official website.  Perhaps the game is being re-tooled as a DS outing?</P>

<P>N-Sider will have more information, including official statements, as it develops.</P>
