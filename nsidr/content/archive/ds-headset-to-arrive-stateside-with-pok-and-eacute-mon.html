<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3117-1.jpg" width="150" height="90" class="image_styled" /></div>Nintendo of America has finally decided to bring the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2315">long-awaited headset accessory</a> for the Nintendo DS stateside, and it took Pokémon to get them to do it.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=1065"><i>Pokémon Diamond</i></a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=1066"><i>Pokémon Pearl</i></a> will feature a voice chat feature for friends playing online, both during and after battles.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=995"><i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i></a>, released last year, also permitted voice chat in its lobby, and will work with this accessory.<br />
<br />
Although Nintendo has yet to make an official announcement beyond confirming the headset's existence and that it would release <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6167510.html">roughly alongside</a> the Pokémon games, retailer GameStop currently has the product <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1&product%5Fid=802623">listed</a> for an April 23 ship date, the day after the retailer will be shipping Diamond and Pearl.
