This afternoon we received an uncharacteristically creative <i>Wii Sports Resort</i> PR piece in our inboxes&#8212;one paying clear homage to the popular television drama LOST, whose final season premieres next week on ABC.  Those who don't watch the show will obviously not get even one iota of these references, but as a huge LOST fan I really got a kick out of it, and wanted to share. I've taken the liberty of bolding pertinent parts of the release for you fellow 815ers.<br />
<br />
<div class="box"><b>Lose Yourself in Nintendo's Tropical Paradise</b><br />
<br />
<b>During the long winter months, millions of people have been eager to get back to a magical island that offers an escape from both time and space.</b> We're talking about Wuhu Island, the setting for the Wii Sports Resortâ„¢ game. <b>It's a lush, tropical setting populated by an array of characters who have taken the initiative</b> to have some fun. But what makes Wii Sports Resort so much fun for friends, family and even <b>others?</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Everyone gets along on Wuhu Island. <b>Petty arguments and elaborate scheming</b> are left behind in favor of fun activities, precision controls and cooperative play.</li>
  <li>Wuhu Island offers a dozen fun resort-themed activities. <b>Four</b> of them are archery, golf, wakeboarding and basketball. The other <b>eight</b> are table tennis, FrisbeeÂ®, Swordplay, cycling, canoeing, Power Cruising, Air Sports and bowling.</li>
  <li><b>Wuhu Island is always there when you need it. Time after time, whenever you go looking for it, it's always right where you left it. Better yet, you can leave and return to the island whenever you want.</b></li>
  <li><b>Wuhu Island is a smoke-free zone.</b></li>
  <li><b>If your plane crashes</b> while you're playing Air Sports, you always restart from where you left off, even if you crash <b>15-16</b> times.</li>
  <li>New technologies, such as the included Wii MotionPlusâ„¢ accessory, might make you feel like you're <b>living in the future</b>.</li>
  <li><b>The biggest twists and turns on Wuhu Island are the ones you make yourself</b>, with the help of the Wii Remoteâ„¢ controller, which is available in <b>both black and white.</b></li>
  <li>Night or day, the basketball courts are always open. See how many <b>2s</b> and <b>3s</b> you can sink.</li>
  </ul><br />
As reported by the NPD Group, Wii Sports Resort was the third best-selling video game of 2009, with more than <b>4.2</b> million sold.</div><br />
If only Nintendo of America was this creative with their releases <i>all the time</i>, we might be more inclined to share them on the site!  Someone at Nintendo is clearly a huge fan, and for once I actually enjoyed reading a press release.
