<h3>N-Banter Edition 5: A Changing Tide</h3>

<p><b><font size="2">Edition: September 25, 2003</font></b><br>
Two minds...one site. Two motives...one goal. Two editors...one conversation. You have now entered a dimension unlike any other. This is <b>N-Banter</b>. 

<p>In this edition Jeff and Glen discuss a certain hedgehog's appearance in Billy Hatcher, the GameCube's recent price drop, and the milking of Zelda.
<hr>


<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I have yet to get my hands on the final version of <i>Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg</i>, but I am quite bothered by a recent news story I saw floating around. This is from TVG (www.TotalVideoGames.com):

<p><I><font size="2">"Yuji Naka has confirmed that Sonic the Hedgehog will make an appearance in the forthcoming GameCube platformer 'Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg.'

<p>Its believed that Billy will meet Sonic whilst hatching a specific egg, and the pair of them will fight against the evil presence that has plunged the world into eternal night."</font></I>

<p>Is this a joke? It doesn't sound very realistic to me. I hope its not true.  

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Hmm, Im not sure. Sonic is pretty popular on GameCube so I wouldn't be surprised if it's true. Sega might be trying to guarantee that <i>Billy Hatcher</i> sells well. Attaching a brand that people are familiar with (Sonic) is one such way to do that. 

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah I suppose. But <i>Billy Hatcher</i> is Sega's first original platformer in years. To me, by shoving Sonic in there, Sega is admitting that it can't sell something without a popular character in it.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I dont know...just look, for example, how Nintendo is relying heavily on existing franchises for new games - <I>Donkey Konga</I>? It's probably not that Sega doesn't have the confidence that the game can speak for itself, but rather it doesn't hurt to have a little leverage including something people are familiar with. 

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I have my qualms with Nintendos insistence on farming out its characters, but everyone knows that those are extensions of a franchise. Sega has been marketing <i>Billy Hatcher</i> as a totally new and innovative platformer. It just seems like it would spoil it to shove a mascot, like Sonic, in the game.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>That article may simply be written misleadingly. Maybe they only meant to say Sonic would make a "cameo appearance."

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Lets hope so. I am okay with a cameo appearance but only if it is done in a way like Nintendo has done in the past. Like in <i>Ocarina of Time</i> how the owner of Lon Lon Ranch wears that Bowser Necklace. Things like that are cool. Or how <i>Animal Crossing</i> has an unlockable Mario Theme for your house. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Really? I never noticed the Bowser necklace. I'll have to check that out.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah, Nintendo shoves stuff like that into their games every now and then. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Sonic Team has done cameo appearances with <i>Nights</i> in <i>Sonic Adventure</i> and <i>Phantasy Star Online</i>. So it's really nothing new.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Sonic cameo's?
 
<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Well, there's a custom Sonic the Hedgehog decal in <i>F-Zero GX</i>, I believe. 
 
<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah but that is an acceptable form of cameo. Doesn't affect the story. Just enhances the customized car mode. Anyway, I just hope that the article in question is overstating the facts or, even better, making them up entirely.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Sonic may have very well originated from an egg. He is a blue hedgehog afterall. :P And he's always incubating those Chao eggs. Seems like more than just a coincidence.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Bah.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I haven't read the news today, but have you seen anything on the supposed Nintendo retailer conference that was supposed to happen?

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I have checked a few sites. The only interesting story I have seen thus far is that the price of the GameCube is officially $99.99 now. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I'm hoping it's Nintendo officially announcing the 'Cube price drop, because if it isn't, then that could mean some bad things for the GameCube's future. If this whole price drop is primarily a retailer initiative, they're not going to be all that willing to continue stocking their shelves with the console.  A price drop, after all, is used to get rid of extra stock.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>It is. Nintendo released a direct press release today regarding the subject. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Awesome. That makes me feel a whole lot better. This is something that will go in the record books.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Haha, GameCube and Game Boy Advance SP are the same price. What a joke. In Canada, Nintendo had to lower the price of the GBA SP along with the price of the GameCube so the GBA SP wouldn't cost more.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah, the GBA SP should be lowered to around $79.99 or $89.99 in all fairness.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Although there's no immediate need to because the SP will still sell very well, it is an indication of the lack of competition in the handheld gaming industry.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Very true. But it is also an indication of just how low console prices are dropping due to competition - just how stiff the competition has become. A Nintendo system hasn't been this low so soon in its life for quite some time, if ever. I really don't know what to think of it. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Well, it might show Nintendo returning to its aggressive ways. It used to be the one to decide price drops. That stopped once Sony became the leader.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>True, but it is also a sign of desperation. Its kind of scary. 

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Well, they did have to stop production for a few months to clear out back-stocks. I'm not too worried about them though; they're still pulling in five billion in profits a year. It really angers me to see all these people in some of the larger gaming forums cheering for Nintendo to drop out of the console race. People dont realize how much that would be a sign that the gaming industry is going down the drain. High production values, movie licenses, and hype (ex. Enter the Matrix) - all of this 'crap' would win out over gameplay, passion, and old-fashioned games.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>I know! The day that Nintendo drops out is the day that I seriously wonder just how much influence gameplay has in an industry thats supposed to be built upon it. That is one of the many reasons I don't really visit many big gaming forums anymore. I, myself, am quite optimistic about the GameCube's future. There are many top-notch games coming out on the system in the coming months.  

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I am kind of disappointed that some games such as <I>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</I> have been delayed into next year. At the same time though, I couldn't afford them anyway, and will be glad to give developers a little more time to really create a polished gaming experience.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah, I kind of wanted <I>Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes</I> this year but now I can use that money to rent and perhaps purchase a few other quality games. I think <I>XIII</I> and <I>Beyond Good & Evil</I> show a lot of promise.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, I'm really looking forward to <I>Beyond Good & Evil</I>. I've wanted a really good adventure game since the GameCube's launch.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Well, the GameCube has had some good adventure games.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Nothing too refreshing though.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Well. Hmm. I suppose it hasn't had many that arent based on pre-existing franchises. Depends how you define an adventure game though. <I>Metroid Prime</I> and <I>Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</I> felt like adventure games to me. But yeah I see your point. The Cube has been kind of lacking in that area.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Zelda. Yeah, and <I>Metroid Prime</I> as well. <I>Metroid Prime</I> felt so lonely though at times...I know that's how it's supposed to feel...but I want an adventure game in the vein of <I>Skies of Arcadia</I>. A game that is open-ended and takes place within a huge world  chock full of interaction, people, and places.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>If <I>Metroid Prime</I> made you feel lonely, then it achieved its goal. Few other games can match the atmosphere of a Metroid game. I haven't really ever played <I>Skies of Arcadia: Legends yet</I>. I keep meaning to, but never get around to it

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, it's definitely one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. You definitely need to get your hands on <I>Skies of Arcadia</I> though.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yeah it appears so. 

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>So what do you think of the upcoming <I>Legend of Zelda: The Four Swords</I> for GameCube? Do you think Nintendo is milking the Zelda franchise and hurting it by developing games like <I>Tetras trackers</I> and <I>The Four Swords</I>?

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Definitely. I'm hoping they simply bundle <I>Tetras Trackers</I>, <I>Four Swords</I>, and the rumored Zelda compilation into one game and call it quits, because really, enough is enough. The Legend of Zelda used to be something special.  Now it's just another <I>Pokemon</I>.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>See I don't think of <I>The Four Swords</I> as a milked out Zelda. When I played the GBA version I found it just as engaging as any of the older Zelda games. The real difference was the inventive multiplayer puzzles and the mayhem that ensues when two to four people all think they are the heroes. I do think that <I>Tetra's Trackers</I> is kind of weird though. At most I think it should be a multiplayer addition to <I>The Four Swords</I>. To me, Nintendo releasing these games doesn't really degrade the integrity of older Zelda games in any way.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, you're probably right.  But when you used to say, "Another Zelda's coming out!" you'd have everyone's ears.  But now, it's just like, another spin-off.  Nintendo is trying to make Link its next Mario. Next we'll have Zelda Golf, Zelda Tennis, etc. Hehe, okay, I'm exaggerating. But still

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b><I>The Four Swords</I> is quite innovative. By saying that it degrades the franchise, as a whole, would be like saying that <I>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</I> or <I>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</I> disgrace and ruin the purity of the Final Fantasy name. I just don't think Nintendo is trying to make Link the next Mario. For one thing, he is just as old as Mario. The Zelda series has been nearly as popular as Super Mario for many years now. When you say a new Mario game is coming out these days people still get excited, despite the millions of spin-off franchises Mario has. So I don't see how that really makes much sense.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I dont know... it doesn't seem like <I>Super Mario Sunshine</I> had as much of an impact as previous Mario games. Though, it is probably my favorite game in the series.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>That is because it was called <I>Mario <b>Sunshine</b></I> and was relatively cheesy in its presentation (even compared to previous Mario titles). The gameplay was great but the atmosphere just didn't meld with the world set forth in previous Mario games. I think its mainly due to the setting and the fact that the gameplay failed to evolve much.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I thought the atmosphere was awesome. Although it would have been nice to include even more of the baddies used in past games. But you can't have everything.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Yup. I imagine that the water pack was a turn off to some gamers as well. It was really the first game where Mario had no magic caps to give him special abilities. Thus, he didn't have many of the abilities people come to symbolize as distinctly Mario.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b> I thought the water pack was the best part of the game!  Honestly though, I think the game audience simply isn't asking for games like that anymore, which is unfortunate.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Now that's where I think you are wrong. Platformers still have life left in them. I believe it was the presentation of <I>SMS</I> that bothered people. Plus gamers are spoiled from the Nintendo 64 era. They assume that if a Nintendo game isn't revolutionary, it isn't good. The concept of evolution is considered a negative term to many. A franchise that doesnt revolutionize is thought of as stagnant and not worthy of attention.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, I suppose.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>But then again, you have stated in the past that you didn't really care for <I>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</I> and went so far as to say that it ruined the series for you. Yet I love the game. So part of the problem is that everyone expects something different from Nintendo. They get this vision of what a game will be like and if it doesn't meet that, it disappoints them.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>I agree with that. I already had a vision in my head of what <I>The Wind Waker</I> would be like...and that's probably what ruined it for me. After <I>Ocarina of Time</I>, I envisioned where they would go with the series from there, and they've since gone as far off from that path as possible.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>See. I had a vision of what the sequel to <I>Super Mario 64</I> would be like. None of that vision included a ditzy looking princess and a story revolving around a character I don't really care much about (Baby Bowser). To me, the way that Bowser was designed was also substandard. I have always pictured Bowser as a menacing foe. His role in <I>SMS</I> was laughable. But I feel totally different about <I>The Wind Waker</I>. I think that it marked the series return to its roots. The overall presentation was very powerful. It felt like a breath of fresh air to the series. The game had more character and a better story than perhaps any other Zelda game I can remember. The sense of exploration in the game is also something that really brought back a sense of fun to the overworld.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, that's something that Nintendo has strengthened this generation. It's child-like artistic style in its games. Both <I>Wind Waker</I> and <I>Mario Sunshine</I> demonstrate this. I didn't mind it at all in <I>Mario Sunshine</I>, but it really dampened my feeling about Zelda.

<p><b><font color="#4F475F">Jeff:</font> </b>Nintendo has been taking a lot of risks in its art direction in games. Every time you change something about a series so fundamental there are bound to be those that just can't relate to the new like they could the old no matter how good the game is.

<p><b><font color="#3399FF">Glen:</font> </b>Yeah, that's a very good point. Still, I really hope that the second GameCube Zelda takes us back to the "land" of Hyrule. 

<p>The only water I ever want to see again...<b>is rain</b>.
