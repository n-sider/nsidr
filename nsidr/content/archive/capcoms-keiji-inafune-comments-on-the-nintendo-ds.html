<p>CV&G caught up with Capcom's Kejji Inafune to ask him about development of <i>Onimusha 3</I> for the PS2.  One of the questions asked however was related to the Nintendo DS.  Take a look at Inafune's thoughts below:</p>
 
<blockquote><font size="2"><p>Excellent news, well we won't give up hope yet then. However the big story at this year's E3 was the battle of the handhelds: Nintendo's DS versus Sony's PSP. What do you think of the prospects for the handheld market and those new technologies?</p>

<p>Inafune-san: I am very positive about both new pieces of hardware. But the characteristics of the PSP and the DS are quite different.</p>

<p>I think the PSP will probably be the one for us to focus on more because it is said that with that type of handheld, PS2 class games can be played.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the DS may just have the capability of an N64 but with the dual screens and the touch panels, there may be an opportunity for some interesting new types of game to be made which have different aspects.</p>
