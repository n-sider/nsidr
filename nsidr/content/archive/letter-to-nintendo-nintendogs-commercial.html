<p>Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo.  So I saw the Nintendogs commercial.  (You can see it <a href="http://ds.advancedmn.com/media.php?gameid=2&medtype=2">here</a> if you haven't already.)  Nintendo, I appreciate the fact that you're creating innovative hardware.  I also admire the fact that you're producing innovative software.  However, if you have this deep ingrained belief in originality...wouldn't it be a good idea to also have the desire to support these products with equally innovative marketing?</p> 

<p>Your official company line is that the games you create are meant to appeal to everyone of every age.  Yet with this commercial, you've pigeonholed Nintendogs to the clueless prepubescent boys who are trying to impress the ho neighbor girls.</p>

<p>The premise of Nintendogs is simple.  You adopt a puppy, take him or her home, and then give them all the tender love and care in the world. Therefore, your target market should be everyone who adores puppies. Somehow this message was lost when coming up with the ridiculous idea for this commercial. Since people love puppies because they're cute (and not because they attract ho neighbor girls), you should appeal to people's soft side.  Something so simple requires but a simple message.</p>

<b>-- Commercial Begin</b>

<p>This is Annie, a six month old Shiba.  Annie is a good-natured pup and gets along with everyone.  She is also very intelligent and easily trained.  She loves the great outdoors, walks well on a leash, enjoys playing catch and going on long walks.  However, she needs a loving place to call home...</p>

<b>-- Commercial End</b>

<p>How easy is that?  You can produce that on a budget of $10.  All gameplay, all puppy, all appeal.  Plus you could have several variations of the commercial showing different breeds of dogs.</p>

<p>So that's all I've to say.  In conclusion, your current commercial is an eye sore.  Fix it, please.  This game deserves much better.  What are your thoughts?  Let me know by sending them to <a href="mailto:glen@n-sider.com">glen@n-sider.com</a>.</p>
