IGN has word that Electronic Arts is <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/784/784856p1.html">at work on a new title</a> for Wii and Nintendo DS called <i>EA Playground</i>.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3168-1.jpg" width="200" height="140" class="image_styled" /></div>The title, inspired in part by Nintendo's own highly successful pack-in <i>Wii Sports</i>, consists of a number of playground-inspired games such as tetherball, dodgeball, RC car racing.  The Wii and DS versions will each have exclusive games, with at least DS carrying games designed specifically for its unique controls such as a stylus-controlled bug hunt or microphone-using spitball game.<br />
<br />
The game seems inclined toward the younger set, offering a sticker book and "a wide selection of cool looking stickers" as reward.  EA Playground executive producer Dave McCarthy says the game is intended to "appeal to all ages".  No word yet on when the game will see release.
