Nintendo of America announced this morning that the <i>Check Mii Out</i> channel will be available for free download via the Wii Shop Channel the evening of November 11.<br />
<br />
The channel's "Posting Plaza" will allow players to submit, exchange, and browse Miis by region or worldwide.  Searching can be done by either creator name or an assigned number, and players can tag or import Miis they like to their own system.<br />
<br />
The channel will also feature a contest section where players will be challenged to create specific Miis such as ones based on historical figures, fictional characters, and themes.  Generally, one week will be given to Mii creation and another week for players to vote for the winning Miis.<br />
<br />
Check Mii Out was initially revealed by Shigeru Miyamoto in March at his GDC keynote, and shown off at this year's E3 summit.
