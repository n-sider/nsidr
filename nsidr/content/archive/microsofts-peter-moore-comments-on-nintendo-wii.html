<p>There has been a community of gamers and game executives forming who support next-generation combos. On one side are those in the PSWii camp (PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii). On the other side are those rooting for the Wii60 (Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii).  <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=12754&rp=49">GameDaily</a> participated in a roundtable with Peter Moore, Vice President of Marketing for Microsoft's Games Division, during the past Electronic Entertainment Expo.  He had nice things to say about his "friends" over at Nintendo.</p>

<p>"Well I hope my friend Reggie [Fils-Aime] sends me one, I don't know," remarked Moore.  " Look I was there when Iwata-san pulled out that thing. I was there in the front row in Tokyo... and I said [to myself] "You've got to give 'em kudos for trying." And I'm literally going to go over there tomorrow and try to find Reggie or find Perrin [Kaplan] and I think Mario's the game... if you've got to play one game it's Mario. I'm sure I'll get one. Right now I'm trying to get my Brain Age down [laughs]. Look, it's not partisan; I love what Nintendo is doing. They're in a different space... and there's this view now that you buy a 360 for Halo, Grand Theft Auto, Gears of War, all the other stuff we got going, and if you want Metroid, you want Zelda, you want Mario, you go get a Wii. And you put the two together and it's probably the same price as the PS3."</p>

<p>You may recall that in a separate interview <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2133">during E3</a>, Moore told Reuters that he predicts consumers will choose two consoles: Nintendo's Wii and Microsoft's Xbox 360. "Tell me why you would buy a $600 PS3?" he asked. "People are going to buy two (machines.) They're going to buy an Xbox and they're going to buy a Wii...for the price of one PS3."</p>

<p>Phil Harrison, executive vice president of Sony Computer Entertainment, responded to Moore's statement in partial agreement. "I think Peter Moore is exactly right," he told <a href="http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=55089">GamePro</a> in an interview. "I think Nintendo will be the second system consumers purchase after PlayStation 3. I haven't had a chance to check out the Wii myself, but Nintendo has a great history of innovation and has always done great things for gaming and long may they do so. But as it relates to our strategy they are very much in a different market."</p>
