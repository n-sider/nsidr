Here's a quickie for you on a simple yet delightful game: Amber and I had the chance to sit down near the end of the show and try out XSEED's <i>Ivy the Kiwi?</i>, a game oft-noted for its association with Sonic creator Yuki Naja's new studio, Prope.  And while it's a very simple game, it's rather fun, though I&mdash;much like our presenter&mdash;prefer the DS version of the two, simply due to its tactile feedback.<br />

The gist is as follows: Ivy, the little kiwi (?), just hatched and in search of her mother, runs on her own across the lovely storybook-illustrated floor while you stretch vines across the playfield to guide her to the exit; three are allowed on the screen at a time, and the last disappears as you draw a fourth.  It's a little more than a simplified <i>Canvas Curse</i>, though; you can not only just give her paths to walk on but also sweep her into the air by sweeping a vine, or grab the vine and snap her into the air to make her perform a screw attack, enabling her to defeat enemies or break blocks.  Sweeping also works on enemies, like rats.  Don't pull too hard on that vine, though, or it'll snap.<br />
<br />
The game has 100 stages in all.  There are little feathers scattered throughout the level; collecting them all records your time in beating the level.  There's also multiplayer modes to play; competitive mode available on both platforms, with split-screen on Wii, and co-op mode&mdash;everyone drawing their own vines on the same screen to get Ivy to the end&mdash;is available only on Wii.  The game can get a little tricky to play at first, but it wasn't too long before I was sweeping the little kiwi (?) around like a champ&mdash;particularly with the feel of the DS screen beneath my stylus.<br />

<i>Ivy the Kiwi?</i> is on track for release on DS and Wii this summer.
