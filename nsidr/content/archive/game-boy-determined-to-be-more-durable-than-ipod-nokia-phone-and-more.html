<p>T3 Magazine compared the durability of an iPod, a Nintendo Game Boy, a Pentax camera, a Nokia 7600 phone, and a laptop, according to Macworld UK, to discover that the Game Boy withstood their tests the best and longest.</p>

<p>The challenge involved dropping the items in a muddy field in Wales, driving them in an off-road vehicle, and subjecting them to a clay pigeon shoot and paintball fire.</p>

<p>The Game Boy withstood these tests the longest.  This shows Nintendo knows its market very well and bodes well for the durability of the Nintendo DS and its dual-screens.</p>
