<p>In a financial report issued Monday, Tecmo <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/729/729152p1.html">said they would support</a> the Wii's Virtual Console "aggressively", presumably offering downloads of some of their classic titles for the service.  Some of the more popular titles Tecmo has released for Nintendo consoles include the original <cite>Ninja Gaiden</cite> and <cite>Tecmo Bowl</cite>.  It's probable they will make an appearance, but Tecmo is not giving specifics at this time.</p>

<p>Tecmo has previously <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1751">committed to bring</a> <cite>Super Swing Golf Pangya</cite> to Wii, but <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2223">has been unclear</a> on whether the title would include its popular online functionality.</p>
