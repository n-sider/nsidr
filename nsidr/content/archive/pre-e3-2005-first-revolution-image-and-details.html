Mere hours before Nintendo's pre-E3 media briefing, the first image of the [still code-named] Nintendo Revolution has hit the 'net, courtesy of Steven Kent's <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/games/2005-05-17-revolution_x.htm?POE=TECISVA">coverage</a> on USAToday.com.  Behold:<br><br>

We also have some of the first concrete details regarding the system's features.  The Revolution shares several traits with the X-Box 360 and Playstation 3, namely its ability to be displayed either horizontally or vertically and its out-of-the-box support for wireless controllers.  It's also backwards compatible with the Nintendo GameCube, uses DVD-sized media for its games, and can play actual DVD movies.  In a departure from its competitors, however, the system itself is similar in size to a stack of DVD cases.  Looking more like a Sony-designed system than the PS3 itself, the Revolution sports a sleek and attractive design while being far more portable than its competitors.<br><br>

Nintendo also has a solid online plan in store for the Revolution.  With a built in wi-fi receiver for connecting to the internet, the Revolution will offer a free online matchmaking service for gamers to utilize.  It will also allow for gamers to download software from Nintendo's past systems, stretching from the NES all the way up through the Nintendo 64.  Whether this means that the Revolution will come with a built-in hard drive has yet to be determined.<br><br>

Also of note is Nintendo's claim that the Revolution will be "2 to 3 times more powerful" than the GameCube.  When compared to Sony's and Microsoft's claims of 35 times and 10-13 times more power over their old hardware units respectively, one notes a significant difference in power between the Revolution and its competitors.  Nintendo's Perrin Kaplan notes that "It's not all about having 'turbo power.'  It's about what you do with it."  It should also be taken into consideration that while Sony and Microsoft have been known to greatly over-exaggerate the power of their own machines, Nintendo has historically been very conservative.  The difference in power between the Revolution and its competitors may not be as drastic as the numbers seem to imply.  Actual media of Revolution games, which will hopefully surface at Nintendo's media briefing, will be sure to show whether or not that is the case.<br><br>

The Revolution's controllers and "revolutionary" features have yet to be unveiled, so there is still much to look forward to in the coming hours.  N-Sider will keep you up to date as new information is released.
