UK videogame magazine Edge recently embarked on a project to have readers vote and nominate, industry creative-types contribute and editors deliberate amongst themselves to determine "Edge's 100 Best Videogames"&mdash;on sale July 3 in 260-page collector's-book form for Â£10&mdash;and Nintendo 64 classic <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> came out on top of them all.<br />
<br />
"Ocarina of Time is nearly ten years old, but its position at the top slot in Edge's 100 Best Videogames shows that great game design does not age," said Tony Mott, editor-in-chief.  "In visual terms, it obviously cannot compete with today's Xbox 360 and PS3 productions, but, as with many classics, its appeal is about so much more than its appearance."<br />
<br />
Immediately following Ocarina was <i>Resident Evil 4</i> (in both its GameCube and PlayStation 2 forms), <i>Super Mario 64</i> in third place, and with appearances by <i>Super Mario World</i> (5th), <i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</i> (6th), <i>Tetris</i> (9th), and <i>Super Metroid</i> (10th).  Three titles not appearing on Nintendo consoles also made the top ten: <i>Half-Life 2</i> (4th), <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> (7th), and <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> (8th).
