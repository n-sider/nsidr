<p>Computer and Video Games conducted an interview with Konami's Hideo Kojima to ask about upcoming <i>Metal Gear</i> titles.  Kojima commented on Nintendo DS development as follows:</p>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<p><b>Q: Have you thought about doing a Metal Gear Solid game for DS?</b></p>

<p>Kojima: It would be nice to have a Metal Gear game for DS, but the thing is I personally think that the audience for DS will be like that of GBA - it'll be a much younger audience. And this Metal Gear's not really suitable for them.</p>

<p><b>Q: What do you think of Nintendo DS? With Boktai on GBA you've proved your commitment to creating innovative handheld products, something which DS facilitates. Are you developing a game for it at the moment, or do you plan to develop for it?</b></p>

<p>Kojima: I'm not working on a DS game right now; it'll be nice to do one in the future. If I were to do something... If I come up with an idea that allows the player to do things that no other videogames creator would do with the two screens and the touch panel, then I'd come up with a game. I want to do something totally different. We went in the morning to take a look at the DS but there was a large queue and we couldn't see it [laughs]!</p>

<p>If the DS becomes really popular, I think kids will start losing their fingerprints [laughs]!</p>
