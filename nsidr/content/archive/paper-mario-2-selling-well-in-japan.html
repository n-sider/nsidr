GameFront reported recently that <i>Paper Mario 2</i> appears to be selling quite well since its release last Thursday. Though it is impossible to know how many units will ultimately leave store shelves, talks with retailers have led some to believe initial sales will land somewhere around 92,000 units sold. N-Sider will have the full report on this week's Japanese sales come next week when Media Create releases sales figures. 

<p><i>Paper Mario 2</i> is currently slated for an October 11th release in North America.
