<p>German gaming news site Gamefront.de has two pieces of news this week concerning Nintendo's upcoming Wi-Fi Connection title, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a>.</p>

<p>First, in a recent issue of Famitsu, the game has scored a very impressive 37/40, getting scores of 9, 9, 10, and 9 from the four reviewers.  The second point of interest is that Japanese preorders for the game, which releases in that territory on November 23, have reached 400,000 -- 60% more than the first-week sales of 250,000 <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><i>Nintendogs</i></a> managed in that territory.</p>

<p><i>Wild World</i> appears to be shaping up as Nintendo's next big DS title.  North Americans will only have to wait until December 5 to get their hands on the localized version.</p>
