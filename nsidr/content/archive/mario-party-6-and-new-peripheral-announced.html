<p>Nintendo of America has announced that Mario Party 6 will appear on the Nintendo GameCube December 6.  But there's more.  Mario Party 6 will make use of the GameCube Mic, the until-now mysterious peripheral Nintendo mentioned earlier in the year.  One such way the Mic will be utilized in the game is for a "game show" mode where players must answer questions with the microphone.</p>

<p>Mario Party 6 will feature 75 all new minigames and six new game boards. A day and night system will be implimented which will alter the way the game is played.  We'll try to have more details and pictures of the Mic device soon.</p>
