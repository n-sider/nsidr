<p>While I was at my local Gamestop/EB on Friday to pick up  
my copy of Harvest Moon DS and Cooking Mama, I found out they  
would begin taking reservations for PlayStation 3 and Wii starting Monday the 18th. The catch was that it required a $50 deposit which had to be done through Trade-Ins. The trade-in limitation posed a problem for me, since I  
only buy games that I know I want to keep. I decided to trade-in some  
360 stuff since I barely play it -- I decided on an extra 360 controller, Burnout Revenge for the 360, and Musashi Legends for PS2  (which I had gotten for free at a Final Fantasy XI party down here).

<p>Now the interesting part is that a lot of people online  
began hearing about this deal, but there was confusion as to  
whether or not it was true, due to the fact that no one could  
find a store that knew about it. The reason is because the company  
is doing a test run on its Hawaii stores only. There are 14 stores  
on Oahu alone, and the island is only about 40 miles square. In fact,  
one mall has two Gamestops in it and one in a shopping center  
across the street. Considering there is no other store or chain of  
stores on the island that have any clue about video games,  
it's no surprise that the company does very well here on the islands.  
It's also a nicely isolated and easily monitored section of stores,  
which makes it perfect for doing a test run of a new program like this.</p>

<p>There was also a lot of comments made online about the  
flyers which said the reservation did not guarantee a system before  
Christmas. This is due to the fact that both Sony and Nintendo have  
not given stores 100 percent guarantees on how many units they will be able  
to ship. For example, usually with the launch of a game or  
system, a company will say "We can promise Wal-Mart 100,000 units,  
Best Buy 75,000 units and Gamestop/EB 50,000 units". Then the  
companies take the number of available units and divide it by number  
of stores they have (sometimes allocating more/less to higher/lower  
selling stores), and are able to provide that many reservations per  
store.</p>

<p>In the case of the PS3 and Wii, no one knows how much they are  
getting. If you have heard an employee say something like they will  
be getting in 'x' amount of PS3s or Wiis on launch, it's something  
that was made up. Companies might get an estimate of  
roughly how many systems will be available to them, but individual  
stores won't know their exact allocations until one or two weeks  
before launch. The Hawaii Gamestop/EB reservation system is going to  
work pretty simple. Let's say that the store gets 10 systems on  
launch. Reservations 1 through 10 will be notified and have 48 hours  
to pick it up. Let's say 9 people pick it up, but someone misses the  
48 hour deadline. The 11th person to reserve it is then offered the  
system. Then, if the store gets in 5 more units, the person who  
didn't pick theirs up the first time is notified along with customers  
12 through 15. It's possible that a different system could be used in  
the mainland, but the Xbox 360 launch was also handled this way.</p>

<p>I headed to school on Monday morning like normal, and left class  
early so I could be at the store when it opened, reserve my Wii, and  
get back to school. I wasn't really worried about other customers  
because the stores didn't even know they were going to take  
reservations until three days earlier on Friday, and I also figured  
that the $50 trade-in requirement would cause most casual gamers or  
potential eBay system sellers to stay away.</p>

<p>I casually made my way to  
the mall and up the escalator when I was surprised by something I was  
not expecting. A large crowd of about 30 people was crowded  
around the doors, all carrying huge bags of games and systems. The  
store didn't even open for another 25 minutes. I tried to listen in  
on conversations to get a grasp on who was there for PS3 and who was  
there for Wii. Three of my friends were in line for a Wii, but other  
then that it seemed about 50/50 from what I could tell. As the doors  
opened, the crowd began to merge into a single file line leading up  
to the register at the front and going out the door in the back with  
me somewhere in the middle. There were two employees ringing people  
up, but it still took a long time to do each transaction since  
everyone was trading things in. Each disc had to be checked and  
looked up in the computer individually, and if a console was being  
traded in it took even longer due to the fact that the unit had to  
be tested. It took me an hour and a half to finally get to the front  
of the line and reserve my Wii. I found it kind of funny that most of  
the people ahead of me traded in systems and 10-15 games, while I  
only had to trade in three items.</p>

<p>It's my personal opinion after witnessing what happened,  
that Gamestop/EB stores in other regions across the mainland will  
start implementing this program soon. If you really think about it,  
instead of passing out flyers about the trade-in program or simply  
trying to tell each customer about it, what could be better than  
having 50+ people lining up outside your doors with at least $50  
worth of trade-ins, if not more. The company often puts heavy  
emphasis on its trade-in program, which is understandable  
considering the large profit margins involved (where as brand new  
games have a very small profit margin). There isn't really a downside  
for them, since it also benefits the stores to have reservations to  
persuade companies into giving them more systems, as well as  
providing a relatively easy way to manage the distribution of systems  
to customers.</p>

<p>It's probably best to try and reserve it at as many  
different companies as you can, but based on my personal experience,  
I have had the best luck reserving and actually getting things at  
Gamestop/EB. Although, I do also understand the hesitation involved  
with trading in $50 worth of stuff. But if and when this program begins  
near you, I'd recommend showing up as early as possible.</p>
