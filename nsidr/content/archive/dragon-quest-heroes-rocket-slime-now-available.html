"Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime is definitely an odd little title. It's technically sound and solid in its gameplay, though it remains to be a primarily one-button game on a system with six buttons and a touch screen, which may baffle a few people starting out. Even still, the development team over at Square Enix made the right move, as Rocket Slime works great as a top-view adventure game that, quite frankly, doesn't need elaborate controls or touch-screen gameplay to make it fun. The style is consistent and entertaining, the gameplay is inviting, and the adventure itself is surprisingly deep with tons of collection and customization aspects. For groups of DS owners, the multiplayer experience is one of the most entertaining we've had on the system, and even though it's a shame to not have Nintendo WiFi Connection support for the game, it's still a blast to play locally. Rocket Slime is a game that knows its audience and knows itself, taking the necessary time to deliver tongue-in-cheek moments and fan-service for Square loyalists to enjoy, while keeping the adventure fresh and simple throughout. We've said it before about Loco Roco, and we'll say it about Rocket Slime as well: The game is like candy. You'll pop it in, have a blast playing it, and move on, only to break it out again when you get the itch for more lighthearted entertainment. Simply put, the game is fun, and nothing more really needs to be said."

"Rocket Slime seems an unlikely candidate for the level of greatness it demonstrates. But between its genuinely clever elements and its preposterously over-the-top ridiculousness, Square Enix and TOSE have crafted a spin-off that captures the appeal of the source material in an amusing and unique way. Hardcore gamers immersed in years of angry brown-and-grey games where everything explodes and the heroes perpetually wear constipated grimaces might experience some serious sugar-shock from its overbearing cheer, but that's part of the makes it so enjoyable. After all, what's the point of games if not to have fun?"
