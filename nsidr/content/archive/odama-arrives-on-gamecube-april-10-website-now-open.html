<p>The <a href="http://odama.nintendo.com/prelaunch/">official website for Odama</a>, the Nintendo GameCube pinball-warfare title from Vivarium, has arrived on the 'net with video and wallpaper.  The game is currently scheduled for an April 10 release.</p>

<p>As a young general who seeks to avenge his father's death, you must use the gigantic ball named Odama to win your many battles. Players use the Nintendo GameCube Mic to direct soldiers into battle and out of the Odama's way.  Since the title is styled after a pinball game, players also take control of two flippers that help direct the Odama ball.  The game currently has a 78 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/920813.asp">GameRankings.com</a> (based on 2 reviews).</p>
