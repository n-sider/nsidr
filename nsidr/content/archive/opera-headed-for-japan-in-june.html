<p>A recent issue of Nintendo Power magazine says that the previously-announced Opera web browser is <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/news.php?aid=15821">headed for the DS in June</a>.</p>

<p>Opera's Berit Hanson, in <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/news/4725">an interview with Cubed3.com</a>, says the browser will support both a fit-to-width mode that reflows the page to fit the DS's low-pixel width, as well as a DS-specific mode that uses the upper screen to magnify portions of the full page, which is shown in thumbnail style on the lower screen.</p>

<p>No date has yet been set for a release outside Japan for the Opera software.</p>
