Comments: In the demo these things attacked in swarms. A bunch of these shielded enemies would take up space in a hallway and form sort of a wall that you could not pass because their collected shield power made it impassable. One at a time a machine from the group would drop its shield to fire and you'd be able to pick it off.<br />
<br />
<b>Crawltank:</b> Small mobile weapon platform. Lightly armored, well-armed.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/e306_prime3_char2.jpg" style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></div><br />
Comments: Simple enemies, they were on the walls and shot at you. Not much more to them, honestly.<br />
<br />
<b>Heavy Aerotrooper:</b> Armor resists Beam attacks. Vulnerable to Missile fire.<br />
<br />

Comments: These were the space pirates that appeared near the end of a dramatic gunfight halfway through the demo level. They had what appeared to be two miniature rockets that helped them fly and these two rockets were attached to them by some sort of energy beam. It seems to me that one could shoot one of these rockets to disable the flying ability, but I didn't have a chance to try this out in my time with the demo.<br />
<br />
<b>Jumpmine:</b> Anti-personnel unit. Rises in air and explodes once engaged.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/e306_prime3_char4.jpg" style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></div><br />
Comments: A constant reminder that Samus must be cautious, no matter how powerful she is. It was easy to absent-mindedly run into these mines when trying to rush through the demo. They were easily defeated, though.<br />
<br />
<b>Pirate Trooper:</b> Battle ready and vicious. Enhanced by phazon.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/e306_prime3_char5.jpg" style="padding: 1px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></div><br />
Comments: These fellows behaved no differently than the space pirates we saw in the previous Prime games. In theory, they're stronger due to phazon, but I didn't notice much of a difference.<br />
<br />
<b>Ridley:</b> Target is armored and shielded. Interior of mouth is vulnerable.<br />
<br />

Comments: Ridley was the boss at the end of the demo (which was an unbelievably awesome fight), who grapples with Samus as she plummets down a shaft in an almost Lord-of-the-Rings-inspired battle. Despite the theatrics involved, it was still a basic boss fight that involved shooting weak points on the character as he followed a pattern. The unique thing about the fight is that since Samus is freefalling she relies more on aiming her weapon than on moving around, which is kind of neat to show off the Wii Remote functionality.
