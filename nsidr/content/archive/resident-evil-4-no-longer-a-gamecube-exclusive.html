<p>Yesterday, Capcom of Japan revealed that it is planning on porting Resident Evil 4 to the PlayStation 2. The company is currently projecting a January (2005) GameCube release for North America and Japan and hopes to have the title out for the PlayStation 2 by the end of 2005. While unexpected, the move was not entirely unpredictable from a business standpoint. In a press release, Capcom justified the move by citing demand by fans that the game be released on more than one system. The company also stated that it believes the decision will "bring about additional revenue base."

<p>Expect to hear more about the PlayStation 2 build as the game rolls onto store shelves, for the GameCube, this January.
