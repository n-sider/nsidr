<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>GM:</b> One thing DS enthusiasts have been wondering about is if whether or not Europa Universalis II will utilize Nintendos coming Wi-Fi online multiplayer game service. If it isnt, why was it decided not to include the feature? Can we expect some form of wireless multiplayer?
<br><br>
<b>GR:</b> We intend to provide wireless support on the Nintendo DS version, permitting the DS to attach to a desktop PC acting as the game host. This support will also be available on the PDA versions, with all platforms interacting seamlessly.
