Here's an "oops".  Over 2,200 employees of Nintendo Co., Ltd. received their September pay check twice, according to Mainichi Interactive.<br><br>
Kyoto Bank which handles salary remittance for Nintendo said the mistake was made because the remittance data was sent twice to the bank. A Nintendo employee sent the bank salary payment information but later in the day realized the submitted info contained errors and so submitted an additional set of edited data.  The bank then accidentally issued payment for both sets of data.  Kyoto Bank officials eventually noticed the mistake and asked financial institutions in which the Nintendo employees hold accounts to send back about 540 million yen, which was fully retrieved within the same day.
