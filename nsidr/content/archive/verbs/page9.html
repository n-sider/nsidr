<div class="header">Verb: Strike</div><br />
<p>Young boys on the playground are particularly intrigued by striking, though Nintendo fans may not have pleasant memories of this one as it was usually the unfortunate kid wearing the Mario t-shirt that got struck.</p>

<p>Here's your chance to strike back.  Hold your controller in your hand, pull back, and strike with as much force as you can muster.</p>

<div class="subheader">Striking with Fists</div><br />


<p>The classic <cite>Street Fighter</cite> actually may have beaten us to the punch here, as early test versions of the game let you hit two large pressure-sensitive punching pads; the force of your strike was dependent on how hard you struck the pad.  (The setup was replaced by the six-button layout due to abuse.)</p>

<p>But now, with Wii, players can strike their opponents simply by holding a controller in each hand and swinging their fists.  No complex button play required; you probably already know how to do this one if you spent any time on elementary school playgrounds.  Take it one step further in boxing games: not only do your strikes follow your hands, but you can block with this strategy as well.</p>

<div class="subheader">Striking with Weapons</div><br />


<p>Couldn't be simpler.  Your controller is the handle of your blade; strike your enemy with it with a thrust forward or a slash through the air.  The controller's built-in rumble lets you feel the strike.</p>

<p>Prefer a club, or a mace?  No problem.  Swing them at your enemy for massive blunt trauma.  Again, the rumble lets you know when you've made a successful hit.  Blocking works similarly, provided your weapon is strong enough to hold up to a strike from your enemy.</p>

<p>As you enter the dark boss chamber in the new <cite>Legend of Zelda</cite>, you can hear noises of something terrifying.  You grab your sword and just as your eyes begin to focus on the fangs of a giant, hairy Ghoma, you swing your sword wildly in the air, severing his two front legs.  Suddenly you're surrounded by two, five, and ten.  Your only chance of survival is held in your hands.</p>
