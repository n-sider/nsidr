<div class="header">Verb: Turn</div><br />
<p>Here's one thing you do every day: open a door.  You grab the doorknob and twist it until the latch gives way and you can enter.</p>

<p>Everyone knows Wii's controller can be aimed, but did you know it can sense rotation along its axis as well?  Holding the controller in your hand, you simply rotate your wrist, and Wii knows.</p>

<div class="subheader">Turning Switches</div><br />


<p>Rotary switches have been present in video games since time began, but we've always been turning them by pushing the "turn" button, tapping a directional pad, or pushing a stick.  No longer.</p>

<p>Need to download that newest map in <cite>Metroid Prime 3</cite>?  Simply insert your virtual arm-cannon by moving the controller toward the TV and turn it a clockwise motion to innitiate the process. Every new area, every power upgrade, any puzzle &mdash; all could involve a simple turn of the wrist.</p>

<div class="subheader">Turning Dials</div><br />


<p>Of course, you don't need to limit yourself to digital switches.  You have a full range of motion available, why not take advantage of all 360 degrees?</p>

<p>Solving that tedious puzzle in <cite>Resident Evil</cite> will be much easier when you can turn the dial with Wii's controller &mdash; simply reach out and adjust.  Just remember to watch out for violent, stuffed animals on the wall in the event of a slip-up (in which case you'd better be turning the nearest doorknob).</p>

<p>Or maybe you fancy yourself a safe-cracker.  Turning your controller in your hand turns the dial on screen.  Turn it slowly so you can feel the latches inside (via the controller's rumble) click and you'll know you're on the right track to getting your hands on the treasure inside.</p>

<div class="subheader">Turning Wrenches</div><br />


<p>Why stop at dials?  You can turn all sorts of things.</p>

<p>Ever wish you could learn how to fix a car without getting your hands greasy?  Disassemble your own engine by loosening or tightening nuts and bolts, virtually, with a turn of the wrist.  Just remember, righty-tighty, lefty-loosy.</p>

<div class="subheader">Turning Hamburgers</div><br />


<p>Nothing beats an old-fashioned cheeseburger, especially when you cook it yourself.  Wii's controller lets you get in on the action, grabbing and turning the burger over.</p>

<p>See that meat sizzling?  Well... reach in and turn it over before it burns!  Don't be too grandiose with your movement, or the burger'll end up on the floor as dog food.  Have fun getting the lid off the pickle jar when it's done.</p>
