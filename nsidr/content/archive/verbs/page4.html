<div class="header">Verb: Throw</div><br />
<p>Now this is exciting.  One of the first actions we learn when we're young is to throw things.  We throw our baby food off our plate in order to observe our mother and father's reactions.  We throw a ball across the room and giggle as the family dog chases after it.  We even throw temper tantrums when we don't get our way.  With Wii, throwing is going to rise to a level never seen before.</p>

<p>It starts off, as throwing is wont to do, with a grab of your object.  You hold the B trigger on the underside of the controller while you make a pitching motion with your hand.  At the right moment, you let go of the trigger to release your projectile.  (Don't be too slow letting go, or you may just pitch it at your big toe.)</p>

<p>Imagine starting up the new baseball game you just picked up for your Wii.  After selecting your team, your play begins in the outfield.  Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners comes up to bat.  Nervously you take the baseball in your hand using the Revolution controller.  You get into the pitching position and at that moment your hand flies through the air and you release the ball.  Strike!  Only two more and he's out.</p>

<div class="subheader">Throwing Bombs</div><br />


<p>There's nothing more satisfying than tossing an explosive to find a once-secret wall &mdash; now a very obvious hole.  As you control your character, you can grab a bomb and with a quick flick of the wrist, toss the explosive in your desired direction.</p>

<p>Of course, you don't have to limit yourself to just blowing up stacks of bricks.  Imagine a game of <cite>Bomberman</cite> played like this, lobbing one over the wall, with a lit fuse set to go off in mere seconds... right into your friend's path.  Trajectory counts, and as we said before, watch the release: many objects will hurt when they hit your feet, but bombs hurt a <em>lot</em> more.</p>

<div class="subheader">Throwing Darts</div><br />


<p>Throwing a javelin makes for a quite dangerous Olympic event, but at the same time, it can prove to be a useful weapon against Mr. King Kong.  Pick up a nearby pointy stick, aim and throw to pierce even the toughest of monkey skin.</p>

<p>Or maybe you prefer something a bit more relaxed.  Cozy on up to a dart board with some friends to see who can acquire the most points.  The loser has to buy the beer, because while Wii's arsenal of new verbs is quite impressive, "providing beer" is not one of them.</p>
