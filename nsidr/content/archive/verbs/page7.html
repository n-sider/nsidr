<p>Imagine yourself as a chef of a famous restaurant.  The controller is your knife, your spoon, your hands.</p>

You get to work, your hands flailing in the air as you chop and slice green pepper, onions and tomatoes.  This is going to be a pizza that would make Papa Luigi proud.  Saut&eacute;e, chop, dice, slice, and flip.  There's no one with more finesse in the kitchen than you.</p>
