<div class="header">Verb: Draw</div><br />
<p>Remember those green chemical light sticks you got when you were a kid at Halloween?  The ones that were supposed to be imbued with magical powers to keep predators in the bushes at bay?</p>

<p>Of course, they weren't anything of the kind, though maybe they did keep a car or two from plowing into you and your bag of candy.  But, if you were like me, they were really cool for one thing: waving around in the air to make drawings of light in front of your face.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/verbs-draw.jpg" style="border: 1px; padding: 3px;"></p>

<p>With Wii, you can do that again &mdash; only now, the drawings won't vanish in a split second and they'll have a purpose other than to entertain you and your little sister for a fleeting moment.</p>

<div class="subheader">Drawing Paths</div><br />


<p>The fastest way from point A to point B may well be a straight line, but it could also be the most dangerous.  Use your controller instead to map out a safer path, or perhaps one that takes a detour along the way.</p>

<P>Call up your map, point at your origin, and hold down the B trigger, tracing your path on your map until you've reached your destination.  Now sit back and enjoy the ride, but be ready, because you may be called upon to engage in battle at any time.</p>

<div class="subheader">Drawing Runes</div><br />


<p>Now, come on, a <em>real</em> spellcaster doesn't tell everyone to stop and wait while he yells out "Magic!"  "Down... down... down... right... there!" to cast his spells.  Yet that's what spellcasters in RPGs seem to do.</p>

<p>No longer.  Now you can take your caster's wand directly into your own hand and cast by sketching the appropriate rune in the air in front of you.  Just be sure to remember the difference between the stroke for "Heal" and the stroke for "Fiery Death Judgment Overkill" when you're pointing your wand at your ally.</p>

<div class="subheader">Drawing Drawings</div><br />


<p>Imagine a giant canvas in front of you.  Your brush is your controller, so take it in your hand and simply go for it.  Push a button to pop up a your artist's palette and use any color you can imagine.</p>

<p>What could be more expressive?  How about if your canvas wasn't just a flat surface, but allowed you to make paint strokes in all three dimensions?</p>
