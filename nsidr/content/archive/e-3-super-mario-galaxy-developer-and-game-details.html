<p><a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/707/707840p1.html">IGN.com</a> learned that Super Mario Galaxy is being developed by Nintendo's EAD Tokyo team, likely under directors <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=124">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=282">Takao Shimizu</a>.  The team handling the project is said to be "much smaller" than the 70 members currently working on Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

<p>The Nintendo Tokyo studio was formed in 2003 to create "unique games for Nintendo hardware platforms, adding to the depth and breadth of Nintendo's first-party game library." Koizumi and Shimizu, who worked on Super Mario Sunshine as director and assistant director respectively, were presented with the task of forming and operating this new team.  Their hard-work paid off.  In 2005, the group released Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat, a GameCube game admired for its unique use of bongo drums.</p>

<p>In an interview with EAD general manager <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=341">Takashi Tezuka</a>, it was found Nintendo is approaching Super Mario Galaxy with open minds.  When asked about a multiplayer option, Tezuka responded, "We are exploring some options. We're looking at some ideas. More than, say, any sort of versus play, I think we'll be more inclined to do cooperative style of play. More than a cooperative style than a versus style."</p>

<p>Finally, Tezuka said the length of the game had not yet been determined.  "Whatever feels best for the controller is how long it will end up being," he noted.</p>
