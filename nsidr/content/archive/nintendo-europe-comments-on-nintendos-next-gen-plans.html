<p>Eurogamer spoke with Shelly Pearce, Nintendo Europe's head of public relations regarding the company's upcoming next-generation home console.  The console is scheduled to make its first appearance at the May 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>  

<p>Pearce addressed the competition saying, "In terms of PlayStation 3, 'exhibited at E3' and 'coming to market' are two very different things.  What we've always said is that we'll be releasing Revolution in the same timeframe as the others. What that timeframe will be is very up in the air at this point."</p>

<p>"Our plan is to talk about our vision for Revolution at E3 next year, and how we're going to revolutionise console gaming," Pearce continued. "At next year's E3 there'll obvious be a lot more discussion about next generation, and we'll be talking about ways we're going to take console gaming forward without just focusing on graphics. But it's far too early to talk about specifics now."</p>
