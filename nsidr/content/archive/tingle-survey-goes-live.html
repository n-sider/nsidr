<p>It's been a little while since we first <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2309">reported on it</a>, but Nintendo of America is now soliciting your opinion of the possibility of localizing <cite>Rupee Land</cite>, the unique spinoff RPG featuring Legend of Zelda lightning-rod Tingle.</p>

<p>The survey is open to My Nintendo members in North America.  If you haven't registered with the site, you can register before you take the survey.  To take the survey, head on over to <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/tinglesurvey/">www.nintendo.com/tinglesurvey<a>, and make your feelings known!</p>
