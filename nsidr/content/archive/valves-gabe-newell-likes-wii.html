Game Informer recently had the opportunity to <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200708/N07.0827.1503.17430.htm?Page=1">speak with</a> Valve head-honcho Gabe Newell. For those who are unaware, Valve is primarily a PC developer, and is responsible for the critically acclaimed series of first-person shooters, <i>Half-Life</i>. The series really drove the narrative aspect into the FPS genre, and continues to do so even today.<br />
<br />
The interview mostly covered topics such as <i>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</i> and the direction Valve is taking with Steam Community on PC. At one point, Game Informer asked Newell if Valve is going to start bringing all projects in-house, as opposed to outsourcing, like with the PS3 release of <i>Orange Box</i>. After confirming more in-house development, Newell surprisingly went off on a tangent about Wii.<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Gabe Newell</span>You can think of the Xbox 360 as pretty much a PC and a PlayStation as kind of a PC. The Wii gives you a bunch of problems that don't fit into that model. You can't think of it as graphics, CPU, texture bandwith scaling, you have to think of it as more fundamentally, and I think it's more valuable.</div></div><br />
Apparently, the man likes his Wii. "It's the machine I have at home," Newell said. He believes that there is a big hole in Valve's strategy because they don't have anything in development for Wii.<br />
<br />
While this is far from a confirmation of Valve games coming to Wii, it is certainly a possibility now.
