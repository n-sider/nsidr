<p>We <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2323">noted yesterday</a> that <cite>Rayman Raving Rabbids</cite> and <cite>Red Steel</cite> developer Ubisoft had said they had five additional Wii titles in the works beyond the previously-announced two.</p>

<p>Today, IGN Wii has <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/723/723080p1.html">the names of those games</a>, as well as the news that Ubisoft plans to have them all ready for Wii's launch window this year.  The list includes a Wii-specific entry in the Far Cry franchise,  <cite>Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII</cite>, <cite>Monster 4x4 World Circuit</cite>, <cite>Open Season</cite> and an all-new racer called <cite>GT Pro Series</cite>.</p>

<p>More information on the titles appears in <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/723/723081p1.html">IGN Wii's interview</a> with Ubisoft NA president Laurent Detoc.  "From what I've played and observed, the Wii will be successful," Detoc concludes.  "It changes our entertainment experience as gamers. It is innovation at its finest. As a creative company, Ubisoft embraced the remote as a gold mine for our talented developers to imagine new ways to play and interact with their TVs. That's what you will get from us across seven games in four different genres.</p>
