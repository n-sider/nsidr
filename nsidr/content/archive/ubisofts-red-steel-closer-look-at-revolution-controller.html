<p>It seems Ubisoft isn't content being the first developer to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1913">showcase a game</a> for Nintendo's next-gen console currently dubbed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Revolution</a>.  They're also determined to rub in our face the fact that they get to make funny expressions while intimately touching the controller.</p>

<p>The team has posted a collection of images taken with the Revolution controller in a variety of poses -- some frightful, others delightful -- on image sharing website <a href="http://forum.fok.nl/topic/843646">Flickr</a>.   These images were also used in <a href="http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200604/N06.0407.1251.24078.htm">Game Informer Magazine's</a> coverage of the game. It's hard to argue; seeing the controller in a person's hand really gives one a new perspective on the hardware's modest size.</p>

<p>Ubisoft is currently preparing Red Steel, a samurai-fighter/first-person shooter, for release alongside the launch of Nintendo Revolution later this year.  More information on the game will come in May at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>
