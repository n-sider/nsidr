<p><a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=T000035">Gamestop</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/241868.asp">EBgames</a> has both set the pre-order price of the Nintendo DS to $199.99. Even more interesting is that both retailers have set the price of the games at $49.99.</p>

<p>These are almost certainly just speculative prices. However it does give an idea as to what to expect the final price to be. Let us just hope that the latter though is not prophetic.</p>
