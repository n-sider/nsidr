I finally got my hands on <i>Elebits: The Adventures of Kai and Zero</i> last night.  Before I get too far, though, I did want to note that it is again Shingo Mukaitoge (of <i>Elebits</i> and <i>Dewy's Adventure</i>) producing this title, as I <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/konamis-mukaitoge-wants-to-do-zelda-one-better-did-he">previously wondered</a>.<br />
<br />
I don't have a whole lot to say about the game that I haven't already noted in <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/elebits-2-demo-suggests-a-full-fledged-adventure">my demo impressions</a> except to confirm that it's got that 2-D <i>Zelda</i> feel to it, even going so far as to borrow many of its conventions&mdash;except maybe a little more the <i>Zelda</i> from the days of <i>A Link to the Past</i> rather than modern signpost "push switches in this order to win prize" Zelda.  There is little hand-holding here, which is usually good for someone like me&mdash;but there has been at least one occasion when I've had to resort to trying all my Omega powers out to pass an obstacle and, when I finally did it, had to say "well, that made no sense."<br />

<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3829-1.jpg" width="185" height="144" class="image_nostyle" /></div>The one thing that surprised me is that the stun-and-collect mechanic has not become tiresome.  There are just enough around to meet my needs, and not so many that it feels like I can't move without becoming swamped with the buggers.  Some are even fighting back.  Kai's capture gun is quite a versatile tool, and the worlds seem to take good advantage of it.<br />
<br />
I'll be writing a full review later, but it's looking pretty good so far.
