<H3>N-Sider Art Contest v2.0</H3>



<P>About a year and a half ago, N-Sider held an art contest to see who could most creatively depict the graphical stylings of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  The results were phenomenal, and we even managed to hire our very own David Hellman based on the material submitted.  Well, it's that time again.  We're proud to present our second art contest here at N-Sider, and now the stakes are even higher.</P>



<P>First, the rules:</P>



<UL>

<LI>Submissions must relate to either the Mario, Zelda, or Metroid universes.

<LI>All art must be original, and done in your own stylings.  That means nothing based on an already-existing picture will be accepted.

<LI>Any mediums will be accepted, be they pencil, ink, pastels, etc.

<LI>Works will be judged on creativity, originality, style, and overall quality.

  </ul>



<P>The best entries will be displayed on the site for all to see, but the BEST of the best will be offered staff positions to assist with the art of N-Universe.  So if you're interested in becoming a part of one of the most ambitious art-based projects the Nintendo fanbase has to offer, send in the best stuff you've got.</P>



<P>The deadline for submissions is <B>March 21, 2003</B>.  All entries can be sent directly to <A HREF="mailto:matthew@n-sider.com">matthew@n-sider.com</A>.  Good luck, and try your best!</P>
