<p>Nintendo Co., Ltd. has been posting a series of <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/topics/interview/vol1/03.html">interviews</a> with the Nintendo Wii designers and engineers.  Much of the discussion has covered information we've already heard.  However, in volume one, part three of the interview, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a>, general manager of Nintendo's Integrated Research & Development division, revealed the Wii console will have an updatable operating system.</p>

<p>This is the first console from Nintendo that has had this functionality.  Takeda admits this enlarges the Wii's future potential as a console.  "You can look forward to this feature, and I am very excited about it too," he said.  Unfortunately, no details were divulged on how Nintendo will utilize it though we expect it will be updated via its online connection.</p>
