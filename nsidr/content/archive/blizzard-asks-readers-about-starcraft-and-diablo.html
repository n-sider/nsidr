Blizzard's most recent newsletter asked readers if they would be interested in buying the strategy games <i>Diablo II</i> and <i>StarCraft</i> on the Nintendo DS if they featured wireless multiplaying options, according to GBA.N64Europe.com. Neither game has been announced to be in development and Blizzard has made no comment on any intention to create the titles.
