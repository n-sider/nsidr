<p>It all started last night at around 10:50pm PST when the Editor-in-Chief of IGN's Revolution Channel, Matt Cassamasina posted a <a href="http://revolutionmedia.ign.com/revolution/image/article/673/673861/n-query-20060309104955185.gif">cryptic message</a> in his <a href="http://boards.ign.com/Message.aspx?topic=112080638&brd=9029&replies=0">blog</a>. Needless to say, the IGN forums literally blew up in an attempt to decipher his clue.</p>

<p>Today, Mr. Cassamasina has made yet another post, this time in a tucked away corner of the <a href="http://boards.ign.com/revolution_general_board/b8263/112021189/p4">Revolution General boards</a>. From the post:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hmm. Well, you won't have to wait for E3 for stuff, that much I can guarantee. GDC should be decent. And you'll learn about and even <b>see</b> games prior to E3.</p></blockquote>

More as it develops.
