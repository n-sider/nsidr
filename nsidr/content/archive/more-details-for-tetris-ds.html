<p>Nintendo of America has released more details on the upcoming WFC-compatible <i>Tetris DS</i> this morning.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-01-27-tetris_balloon_fight.jpg"></p>

<p>New screenshots show that at least one game mode will let players use both screens as one extra-large playfield.  The pictured new mode is based on <a href="http://n-sider.com/gameview.php?gameid=189&region=1"><i>Balloon Fight</i></a>, and shows a theme-specific item of a cage of balloons &mdash; purpose yet unclear.  It's reasonable to speculate that different game modes have different themed items to use.</p>

<p>Nintendo also describes the Standard and Touch modes as follows:</P>

<ul><li><p>Standard: This Mario-themed mode features the same addictive game play that made the original Tetris so wildly popular. Players guide falling Tetriminos (falling blocks) and form horizontal lines to clear them away. Mario runs around Super Mario Bros. levels in the background.</p></li>

<li><p>Touch: This unique take on Tetris really shows off the touch-screen capability of Nintendo DS. Players use a stylus to drag and move Tetriminos in a giant stack to make them fall into horizontal lines. In early levels, they can tap Tetriminos to spin them just the way they need them. Players have as much time as they need to carefully plan their moves, so it plays very differently from the other frantic modes.</p></li></ul>

<p><i>Tetris DS</i> hits stores March 20 in North America.</p>
