Nintendo Co., Ltd. president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> has good news for consumers still frantically looking for one of his company's perpetually sold-out console: <a href="http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,21644123%5E15321%5E%5Enbv%5E15306,00.html">more are on the way</a>.<br />
<br />
"We must do our best to fix this abnormal lack of stock," Iwata said. "We have not been able to properly foresee demand... We will do our best to offer the machine for those who are waiting."<br />
<br />
Iwata wouldn't be pinned down on figures either of current production (though given the sellouts, the system's actual sales figures of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2726">5.84 million through the end of March</a> would be a good guess) or how many more units he expects to be able to produce.  It's likely that the company's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2694">search for manufacturing partners</a> has borne fruit in this regard.
