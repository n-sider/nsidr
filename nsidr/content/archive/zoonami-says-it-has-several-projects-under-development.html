<p>Zoonami, developer of the recently announced multiplatform <i>Funkydilla</i> music-mix title, said it is still in development with <i>Game Zero</i>, according to a report by IGNCube.com.</p>

<p>"We have projects in the works apart from Funkydilla, some are very long-term, and we can't talk about them," Zoonami president Martin Hollis told IGNCube. "'Game Zero' is a working title we don't use anymore, because it collides with an online gaming magazine."</p>

<p>When asked if the company had plans to debut any titles at E3, Hollis replied, "We don't plan to show any games at E3.  It is a bit of a cattle-market really."</p>
