System 3's CEO, Mark Cale, has confirmed that they have <a href="http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=7595">another downloadable Wii game</a> in the works. Alongside <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2735">previously-announced</a> Wii Ware title <i>Impossible Mission</i>, System 3 is also remaking <i>California Games</i>, another classic Commodore 64 game released by Epyx.<br />
<br />
California Games was a compilation of several sports minigames: surfing, BMX, Frisbee, Keepy Uppy, half pipe and rollerblading. The update will feature a total of twenty-two events, to be unlocked after earning a gold medal in the first six games. A full list of additional events is not available, yet, but it will include kayaking, cycling, running, javelin throwing, high jumping, and equestrian (presumably something to do with horses).<br />
<br />
Cale also mentions that there will be some upcoming announcements from Nintendo regarding downloadable content, but what those announcements are he did not say.<br />
<br />
Neither Impossible Mission nor California Games has an official release date for the downloadable version, but the retail versions of both are tentatively scheduled for release within the next few months&mdash;Impossible Mission for DS and PSP, and California Games for DS, PSP, Wii, and PS3.
