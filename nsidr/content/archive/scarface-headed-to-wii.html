In its latest issue, British gaming magazine NGamer is featuring the upcoming Wii port of last year's <i>Scarface: The World is Yours</i>.<br />
<br />
According to <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=156361">the meta-report from CVG</a>, the Wii-enhanced port will feature the obvious Remote-aimed gun scenario, as well as allowing the player to fist-fight enemies and random passers-by, and use the Remote as a chainsaw to mangle folks while the sound emanates from the speaker.<br />
<br />
Scarface is currently pegged for "later this year", pending a more accurate release date at a later time.
