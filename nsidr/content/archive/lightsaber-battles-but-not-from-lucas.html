Continuing <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2551">our coverage</a> of cool Wii Remote hacks, we've found developer Isnoop and a little Mac application called <i>WiiSaber</i>.<br />
<br />
WiiSaber is based on his earlier <i>MacSaber</i> program, which used the MacBook Pro's motion sensor to create Star Wars lightsaber sounds when you swung it around.  Utilizing code that gets a Mac talking to a Remote, Isnoop has now done the same thing for the Wii Remote, significantly reducing the potential cost should your waving become too exuberant.<br />
<br />
You can try <a href="http://isnoop.net/apps/latest.php?app=WiiSaber">a prerelease version</a> of WiiSaber out for yourself, if you have the requisite equipment.  Reg Hardware has <a href="http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/12/12/wii_remote_is_light_sabre/">more information</a>.
