Government body Learning and Teaching Scotland has found that kids aged 5-6 playing 20 minutes of <i>More Brain Training</i>&#8212;Europe's version of <i>Brain Age 2</i>&#8212; showed improvements in behavior, student-student cooperation, and focus, by the teachers' reckoning.<br />
<br />
On the success of the trial, LTS is considering implementing the Brain Age regimen in other Scottish schools, which would no doubt be a big win for Nintendo in Europe&#8212;provided the kids don't surreptitiously swap out the good polygonal doctor for some Pok√©mon.<br />
