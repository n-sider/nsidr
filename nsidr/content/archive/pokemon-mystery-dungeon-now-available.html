"Like most spin-off titles, Mystery Dungeon fails to capture the spirit and replay incentives that made the core products so irresistible to gamers of all ages. If endless dungeon crawling is your thing, then you should give this title a whirl. However, if monotonous gaming and skimpy Pokemon action aren't your thing, then this is one mystery that's best left unsolved."

"You may have a tough time getting through Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon, but it is an RPG after all, so why not play it like one? Stock up on items, tread lightly, and if you're not treading lightly, then know when to retreat. You won't find a better handheld RPG so fitting for bite-size moments of play, and those cute 'n' marketable pocket monsters are only the icing on the cake"
