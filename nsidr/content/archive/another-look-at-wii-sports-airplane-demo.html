<p>Someone has uploaded the full Wii Airplane demo to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG201q53b8U">YouTube</a>.  The second half of the video provides a nice preview of how the Wii remote control is used to navigate the plane through the game's tranquil skies.  Meanwhile, the first half of the video gives us a look at the gameplay.  You take control of a plane and fly through floating rings.  A flock of pesky seagulls follows your path, perhaps under the impression that you're the Red Baron and have pizza on board. The plane glides along the coast, next to mountains and over a rustic city.  Anyone have a BB gun?</p>
