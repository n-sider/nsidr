<p>Majesco, developer of Nintendo's Game Boy Advance <a href="http://www.gba-video.com/today">Video</a>, announced it has filed five patents for compression technologies related to the creation and playback of video for handheld devices.</p> 

<p>"Majesco's proprietary technologies allow for full 'DVD-like' control of the video," said Jesse Sutton, CEO of Majesco. "Consumers have grown accustomed to the rich features on DVDs such as fast-forward, rewind, animated chapter menus and instant chapter skip. Our technology brings that same set of features to small handheld devices that use ROM cartridges instead of optical disks."</p> 

<p>The first videos are scheduled to release this spring by several major retail partners.  Majesco predits initial orders could surpass one million units.</p> 

<p>"The real benefit of this technology is its extraordinary compression capabilities," said Kevin Ray, Chief Technology Officer of Majesco. "We're taking 45 minutes of video - which is around 2,500 megabytes uncompressed - and we're squeezing that into a container that can hold 32 megabytes."</p>

<p>Majesco is expected to showcase the videos and video technology at the upcoming 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>
