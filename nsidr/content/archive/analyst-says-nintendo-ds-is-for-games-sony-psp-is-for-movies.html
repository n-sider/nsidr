<p>UFJ Tsubasa Securities analyst Takashi Oka speculates that Nintendo's new handheld, the Nintendo DS, has little competition from Sony's PSP handheld, according to PolygonMag.com.</p>

<p>Oka said he feels the Sony PSP will be used more for movies and music rather than games. "Nintendo's power in creating game software is still going strong," he said.  "I don't consider the PSP as a game machine so its arrival won't affect Nintendo."</p>
