<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3486-1.jpg" width="200" height="197" class="image_styled" /></div>Nintendo is now wrapping all new Wii Remotes in a "Wii Remote Jacket".<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Announced this morning in a Wii Message</li>
  <li>Intended to provide "cushioning for the Wii Remote for people who might accidentally throw or drop their Wii Remotes while playing games"</li>
  <li>Nintendo recommends "players use the new Wii Remote Jacket as a cushiony shield, though the current Wii Remote is a safe product when used properly."</li>
  <li>Nintendo Australia: "We recommend to fit the 'Wii Remote Jacket' to the Wii Remote in order to enhance your grip and provide additional protection if the Wii Remote is accidentally thrown or dropped during game play."</li>
  <li>North American customers can <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/jacket/jacketrequest.jsp">request free jackets</a> much like they were able to with the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2563">thicker wrist straps</a></li>
  </ul><br />
