<p>An article in the United Kingdom's Official Nintendo Magazine has hinted that Nintendo may be planning to release a number of big name titles by the end of the year. Most notably <i>Metroid Prime 2</i>, <i>Geist</i>, and <i>Pokemon Fire Red</i> / <i>Leaf Green</i> are all slated to hit European shelves by the end of the year. (Note that if the games are scheduled to hit Europe this year, a North American release before or around the same time is very likely).

<p>The article also quoted Shigeru Miyamoto, who asked fans to be patient regarding news on Mario 128. He also confirmed that another Legend of Zelda is in development for the GameCube.
