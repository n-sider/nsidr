<p>Although not exactly a surprise. Nintendo's President, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> has confirmed that next generation versions of Zelda, Metroid, and Mario are currently in the works for the Revolution. He also stated that "<i>Nintendo has big plans for Metroid on the Revolution.</i>"</p>

<p>Nintendo has also announced that Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles is also in development for the Revolution. Whether or not this is a remake or a new entry in a series is yet unknown.</p>

<p>Even sweeter is the news that a new entry in Nintendo's always popular Super Smash Bros. series will not only be a Revolution launch title, but also be online.</p>
