In a GDC <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200703/N07.0309.1142.57468.htm?Page=2">interview</a> with Game Informer, Zelda series head Eiji Aonuma is asked many things about the franchise he's in charge of&mdash;and one of them is one new detail about upcoming Nintendo DS title <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>'s multiplayer mode:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote"><b>GI: Is there only one multiplayer mode?</b><br />
<br />
Aonuma: Yes, but there's also going to be a tag mode. So there will be variation.<br />
<br />
<b>GI: Right now its one-on-one. Will there be more than one-on-one play?</b><br />
<br />
Aonuma: No. I would like everyone to battle one-on-one.<br />
<br />
<b>GI: Will you be able to battle over the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection?</b><br />
<br />
Aonuma: Yes.</div><br />
Of course, when the game is actually released, the presence or absence of Wi-Fi Connection support may still change&mdash;so stay tuned on that front.  Phantom Hourglass is slated for a holiday 2007 release.
