What had been long-rumored is now official. <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=982">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, father of Kirby and Super Smash Bros., revealed in a column in the latest Famitsu magazine that he will serve as director and game designer on HAL Laboratory's <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> sequel for project Revolution.<br><br>

As you may recall, Sakurai left HAL Laboratory in Fall of 2003, citing the motivation for his departure was due to a lack of freedom and dissatisfaction with having to only create sequels.  He has since worked with Q Entertainment on the Nintendo DS action-puzzle title <i>Meteos</i> and also formed his own company named Sora.  More information on Sakurai can be found in N-Sider's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/hal-laboratory-company-profile/5">HAL Laboratory</a> profile. <br><br>

Sakurai noted in his column that after he left HAL Laboratory, his former boss, current Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a>, said he would like to keep in contact with him in case he would be interested in consulting on a future game.  Then at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2005, Sakurai was sitting in the audience during Nintendo's press conference and was surprised to hear Iwata announce a Wi-Fi compatible <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> title in development for Nintendo's next-generation home console.  One of the following days during the E3 show, Iwata requested a meeting with Sakurai.  Sakurai met with Iwata in his hotel room where he was asked to be involved in the production of a new Super Smash Bros. and preferably in the role of a director. Out of all the games Sakurai has had a part in, the Smash Bros. series holds a special place in his heart.  Needless to say, Sakurai accepted.<br><br>

More recently, during the September 2005 Tokyo Game Show, Nintendo unveiled the Revolution's controller for the first time.  Nintendo Dream, a Japanese magazine, caught up with Sakurai to get his comments on the controller.  Sakurai noted, "I'm sympathetic for Nintendo's stance of reducing hurdles for games. For that reason, I think it's good that the controller buttons have been reduced to just one. A long remote controller shape with just one button. This has impact. The DS, with its touch screen, made games a ways easier to understand. However, with the D-pad and buttons, and also the touch panel, controls actually became more complicated. I think it would be good if the same thing doesn't happen with Revolution."<br><br>

It's still unknown whether or not Super Smash Bros. will utilize a traditional control method or the new "Revmote".  Considering the game was likely in development for a significant time before any of the controller's features were known, it's likely the game will instead use standard controls.  We'll let you know of any news in that regard.
