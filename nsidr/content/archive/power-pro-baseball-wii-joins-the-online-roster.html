Konami's Jikkyou Powerful Pro Baseball is <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/789/789779p1.html">heading to Wii</a>, and the latest issue of Famitsu has some details on what's coming.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it appears to be a mere port of the version heading to the PlayStation 2 this year. On the other hand, it is bringing with it almost all of the features included in the PS2 version&mdash;most notably online play.<br />
<br />
The online mode consists of 1v1 matches, as well as a few features to be revealed in the future. The Wii version will also feature a "Remote Power" mode, which operates similarly to the Baseball portion of Wii Sports&mdash;however, the rest of the game will use classic controls. On the plus side, Konami is adding support for the remote/nunchuck combo, Classic controllers, and Gamecube controllers.<br />
<br />
Both the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions of <i>Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu Wii</i> hit Japan on July 19&mdash;and it's highly unlikely they will see an American release.
