<p>GameDaily BIZ recently had <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/interview/?id=12048">a chat with GDC 2006 director Jamil Moledina</a> regarding what to expect out of the upcoming conference.  He had this to say when asked about Phil Harrison's (Sony) keynote:</p>

<blockquote><p>In general, platform providers have a unique opportunity at the GDC to share knowledge with and inspire the people who will make or break their consoles, namely the game developers themselves. With that in mind, [Harrison's] GDC keynote, along with the Nintendo keynote by Satoru Iwata, have both been in development for several months, and contain significant editorial value and developer takeaway. I strongly encourage you to attend both platform keynotes.</p></blockquote>

<p>Iwata's keynote, entitled <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/conference/keynotes.htm#Nintendo">"Disrupting Development"</a>, runs from 10:30-11:30 AM on Thursday, March 23.  The keynote will discuss how recent "disruptive" products such as the Brain Training series and the Nintendo DS have "surprised the market"; no doubt touching on how Nintendo intends for its upcoming Revolution console to do the same.</p>
