<P>Some wild and crazy guy recently decided it was a good idea to dismantle a Super NES and an XBox and then put all the guts together in a large, Lego-built case.  Naturally he took photographs and posted them on his personal webspace (complete with an totally irrelevant biography toward the bottom of the page).</P>

<P>Says the builder of his Frankensteinian creation: "All told the team spend about 40 man hours or so to build it."  Based on the quality of the object, this writer can only assume that hours must be shorter in Texas.  Check it out (if you dare) <a href=https://webspace.utexas.edu/sah725/index.html>here</a>.
