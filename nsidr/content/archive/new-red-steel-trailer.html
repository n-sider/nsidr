<p>Ubisoft has prepared a new Red Steel trailer for this week's Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany.  The footage is a remix of gameplay shown at the past May E3 Expo highlighting familiar gun fights and sword play.  Check out the video below, courtesy of <a href="http://wii.ign.com">IGN</a>.  Red Steel is set to launch alongside the Wii console later this year.</p>
