<p>Nintendo Europe has begun to post <a href="http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/wii/?site=v1_01.html&l=enGB">translations</a> of the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/topics/interview/vol1/index.html">interviews</a> Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> has given the design team for upcoming home console Wii.</p>

<p>In the first posted portion, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a> tackles the question of what drove Nintendo to pursue an unconventional technology roadmap with Wii.  "After speaking with Nintendo's development partners, I became keenly aware of the fact that there is no end to the desire of those who just want more. Give them one, they ask for two. Give them two, and next time they will ask for five instead of three. Then they want ten, thirty, a hundred; their desire growing exponentially. Giving in to this will lead us nowhere in the end. I started to feel unsure about following that path about a year into development."</p>

<p>Nintendo Europe appears to be planning on posting the other parts of the interview soon, so stay tuned.</p>
