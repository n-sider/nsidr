<p>Nintendo announced a new feature of its Wii console today at its press conference.  It's dubbed "Wii Connect 24."  This feature allows the Wii console to be connected to a network 24/7.  The console automatically enters a stand-by mode that uses the same power of miniature light bulb. This means the Wii console can be permanently connected to the internet. This opens up the opportunity to developers to stream new weapons, new levels, and new characters to your Wii console even while you're asleep. People could also for example, visit your Animal Crossing village while you're away. Nintendo said all networking software will be included in the hardware.  Stay tuned to N-Sider for more details.
