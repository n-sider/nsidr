2K Sports and Konami announced today the impending publication of <i>MLB Power Pros</i> for Wii as well as Sony's PlayStation 2.<br />
<br />
Based on the popular Japanese Power Pro baseball series, which had a Wii entry released last month as <i>Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu Wii</i>, Power Pros adds MLB characters to the mix, shown in the "Power Pro" character style: a miniature toy-like figurine model.  Every MLB ballpark has been replicated for the game, and the title features over a dozen game modes including Season Mode (be a team general manager) and Success Mode (combining RPG elements with baseball scenarios).<br />
<br />
MLB Power Pros is set for a release this fall.
