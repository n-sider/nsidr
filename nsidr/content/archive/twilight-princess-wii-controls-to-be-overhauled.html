<p>By way of IGN Wii comes news from the latest Nintendo Dream that <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/726/726748p1.html">controls will be overhauled</a> for the Wii version of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911"><cite>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</cite></a>.</p>

<p>The new control scheme will have players actually swinging the controller to make Link swing his sword, instead of the E3 2006 arrangement where players used the B button on the underside of the Wii Remote.  The B button is now freed up for Remote-based item tasks such as firing arrows, which was previously mapped to D-pad down&mdash;something Shigeru Miyamoto felt was too difficult; our own Cory Faller <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/wii-zelda-unfortunate-reality">agrees</a>.</p>

<p>Asked which version he'd rather play, Miyamoto said the Wii version was his preference, but both the Wii version and the originally-announced Nintendo GameCube version would be fun.  Both versions of Twilight Princess are set to launch alongside the Wii in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
