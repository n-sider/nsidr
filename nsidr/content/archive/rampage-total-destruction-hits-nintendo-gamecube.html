<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-04-29-rampagetotaldestruction.jpg" align="right" alt="Rampage Total Destruction for Nintendo GameCube">Midway's "Rampage Total Destruction" is now available for <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=220590">Nintendo GameCube</a> for a retail price of $19.99.  The game currently has a 58 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/929425.asp?q=rampage">GameRankings.com</a> (based on 11 reviews).  Check out the game's official <a href="http://www.rampagegame.com/">website</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Rampage: Total Destruction takes the arcade classic and brings it to the third dimension. Players are encouraged to destroy the game's environments through a lengthy single-player campaign. Players can also join up with a second player and collaborate in the world's destruction.</p>

"If classic gaming is what you're looking for, Midway Arcade Treasures is a great series to get a hold of, seeing as they're all at the $19.99 price as well. Die-hard Rampage fanatics may still want to rent this one for a few entertaining hours of gameplay despite the frustrating moments, though we'll warn you in advance that it won't. We can't recommend Rampage: Total Destruction as a purchase, however, though it's the first of the franchise to get back on the right track. Here's hoping for another chance at a next-gen arcade revival."

"There's a certain irony in the fact that Rampage: Total Destruction was developed by longtime Godzilla developers Pipeworks Software. For as dull as the action in those games tended to be, at least they gave you more to do with wide-open 3D environments and more in the way of angry monsters fighting each other with cool-looking moves. Total Destruction didn't necessarily have to turn into some kind of carbon copy of those silly Godzilla games to succeed, but the fact that it can't even quite measure up to the flawed giant monster games of the recent past is a pretty damning thing. At best, Total Destruction is a brief distraction. At worst, it's an obsolete relic from too many years ago."

"Now, ten years down the road, we're back again with Rampage: Total Destruction, and while the game continues its multiplayer mayhem on a new platform, one can't help but think it's the same old thing all over again. Some parts are still satisfying, and it's a wise move on Midway's part to include the older versions, but some control problems come into play, and the game gets old way too quickly. What Rampage needs is a good, strong jolt of power, kinda like the ones the monsters get hitting electric signs. Ah, well, for $20, you get a few hours of monster bashing with friends."
