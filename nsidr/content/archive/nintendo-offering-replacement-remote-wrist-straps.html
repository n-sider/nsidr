In the light of a growing number of Internet reports of Wii owners losing control of their Remotes and damaging furniture, walls, electronics, and bystanders, Nintendo has begun as of early December to put a slightly different wrist strap in the box including a more robust-looking loop where the strap attaches to the Remote.<br />

Customers who purchased Wii prior to the change-over and who have older versions of the strap can <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/strapreplace.jsp">request free replacements</a> from Nintendo of America.  The company expects to begin shipping the new straps December 21st.
