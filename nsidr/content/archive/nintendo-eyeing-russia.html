This weekend, a story in Reuters indicated that Nintendo Co. is <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=businessNews&storyID=2006-10-29T043708Z_01_T201150_RTRUKOC_0_US-JAPAN-NINTENDO.xml&WTmodLoc=NewsHome-C3-businessNews-3">looking at expanding its presence</a> into Russia, citing a report from business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun.<br />
<br />
Although Nintendo has not commented on this move yet, the Shimbun says Nintendo of Europe has already got a local agency on board to start sales of software and hardware next month.  Reuters cites the maturity of the U.S., Japanese, and European markets as reasons for Nintendo to consider expansion.<br />
<br />
Hopefully for Nintendo, a subsidiary in Russia will end up better off than Nintendo's Korean subsidiary, whose effectiveness was questioned by <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/09/06/playing-nintendo-v24-korea-needs-a-reggie-lution/">an investigative report</a> done by 4ColorRebellion in September.
