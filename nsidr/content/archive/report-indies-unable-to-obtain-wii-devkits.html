Astute readers will recall that in the run-up to Wii's release&mdash;specifically including the 2006 Game Developer Conference&mdash;Nintendo has been saying that they will have programs to get independent developers on-board with Wii, presumably via the Wii Ware section of the Wii Shop Channel.<br />
<br />
It seems that these developers are experiencing the same pain gamers wanting to acquire Wii in the first place are still running into, though: Wii development kits are reportedly <a href="http://www.watercoolergames.org/archives/000748.shtml">very difficult</a> to get a hold of.  One such indie, Water Cooler Games ("videogames with an agenda"), says they've heard this is because "Wii publishers are taking all of the available inventory, and more".<br />
<br />
As a result, the Wii Independent Developer Program seems to be on hold until the end of the month, at least.
