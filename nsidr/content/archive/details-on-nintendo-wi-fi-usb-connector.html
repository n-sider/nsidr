<p>1UP.com has gotten a hold of a Nintendo Wi-FI USB Connector.  As such, they've been able to document the simple process of attaching it to a PC and connecting the Nintendo DS to the internet.</p>

<p>"The DS's WFC Connection functionality automatically seeks and locates all available access points, and from there it's a simple matter of entering the HEX equivalent of the network password," noted the author of the article. "Simple, fast, painless."</p>

<p>Check out the full article with pretty pictures detailing the process <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3145484">here</a>.  Users will be able to purchase the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector later this month at <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com">nintendowifi.com</a>.</p>
