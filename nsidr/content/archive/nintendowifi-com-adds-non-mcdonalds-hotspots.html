<p>Through a partnership with JiWire, NintendoWifi.com now offers hotspot searching in the United States (as well as several other countries) for hotspots that aren't inside McDonald's restaurants, JiWire announced today.</p>

<p>You can search for these additional hotspots by checking the "non-partner" checkbox on NintendoWifi.com's <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/hotspots/searchHotSpot.do">hotspot search engine</a>.  However, results will be tagged with the warning "these sites may not be compatible with the Nintendo DS", and for good reason: the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi implementation lacks the web browser or other features required to use some public hotspots' access control features.  Nonetheless, it's good to see at least the beginnings of WFC availability outside one restaurant chain.</p>
