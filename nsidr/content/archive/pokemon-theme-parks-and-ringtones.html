<p>In related Poke news, Nintendo will be operating a traveling Pokémon-themed amusement park.  The park will begin in Taipei, Taiwan, and run for three months in which time Nintendo expects it to draw over 1 million visitors.  Depending on the park's reception, it may eventually arrive in the United States, Europe, or Shanghai.  The park was originally setup in Nagoya, Japan, for the World Exposition last September where it drew 4.5 million visitors during its initial six months of operation.</p>
