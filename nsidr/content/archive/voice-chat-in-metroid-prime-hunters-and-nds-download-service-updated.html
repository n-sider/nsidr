According to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-02-09-ds-downloads_x.htm?POE=TECISVA">USAToday</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>, Nintendo of America's executive vice president of sales and marketing, announced  new wireless features for use on the Nintendo DS.  Reggie revealed the news during his speech "Expanding the Market for Interactive Entertainment" at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' D.I.C.E. conference in Las Vegas this morning.  Gamers will soon be able to download game demos, movie trailers and other content directly to the Nintendo DS via kiosks at retailers such as Best Buy and GameStop.<br><br>

The first batch of game demos available will include Tetris DS, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, Mario Kart DS, Meteos, True Swing Golf, Pokmon Trozei, and a video clip of Metroid Prime Hunters. The selection will change every four months.<br><br>

Nintendo also revealed that voice chat would be available over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with Metroid Prime: Hunters, which will release March 20. Players who join up for multiplayer battles over Nintendo's wireless Internet service will be able to talk to each other through the system's built-in microphone before and after games, but not during.<br><br>

Finally its been announced that Nintendo's Wi-Fi gaming service has seen more than 20 million connections and over 850,000 unique users since its launch two months ago.  These numbers will likely only increase with the upcoming releases of Metroid Prime Hunters and Tetris DS.<br><br>
