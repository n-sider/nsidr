<p>GDC 2006 has been over a few weeks, but Gamasutra has just picked up a bit from an interview conducted there with <cite>Katamari Damacy</cite> creator Keita Takahashi on Nintendo's upcoming home console, still code-named Revolution.</p>

<p>"I'm not really interested in it. I don't think a controller should have that much influence on the enjoyment of games," Takahashi says about the controller.  "I see what [Nintendo is] trying to do, but they're putting such emphasis on the controller; 'Woah, this controller lets you do this!' and I'm thinking &mdash; are you messing with us?"</p>

<p>It's unknown at this point what game Takahashi is working on next, or even what platform it's for, or even if he's working on games at all &mdash; in a recent BBC interview he said he'd rather design childrens' playgrounds than games.  But it seems that for now, he's probably not working on Nintendo's Revolution.</p>
