<p>French developer Dream On Studios is creating a racing title for the Nintendo DS, according to Jeux-France.com.  Dream On Studios is known for the development of <i>Mr. Nutz</i> for the Game Boy Advance.  Check out this article from <a href="http://www.eagb.net/advance/rep_07.html">EAGB Advance</a> which shows the company is working on a 3D Nascar title for the Game Boy Advance.  Perhaps this is the "racing title", or at the very least, the genre of racing, Dream On Studios is bringing to the Nintendo DS.</p>
