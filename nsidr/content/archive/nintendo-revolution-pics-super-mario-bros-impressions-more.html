<p>There were several tidbits of news that came out of the Game Developer's Conference today.  Compiled below are those that were missed in earlier stories, including new shots of the Revolution hardware as well as New Super Mario Bros. impressions.  Be sure to come back in the morning at 10:30AM PST to join us for Satoru Iwata's speech which is sure to reveal even more news.</p>

<li>There's a whole bundle of <b>Revolution hardware images</b> over at <a href="http://media.revolution.ign.com/articles/697/697733/imgs_1.html">IGN.com</a>.  Over 40 shots give an up-close and personal look at the stylish new Nintendo hardware.  An attentive eye can see that the X and Y button are accompanied by an A and B label -- we can only guess this is to facilitate the virtual console aspect?  IGN was told this is the same hardware shown at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005, and there have since been some minor changes to the controller.<br><br>

<li>New <b>Super Mario Bros. gameplay impressions</b> come to us courtesy of <a href="http://www.planetgamecube.com/impressionsArt.cfm?artid=11217">PlanetGameCube.com</a>, <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697674p1.html">IGN.com</a>, <a href="http://blogs.gamedaily.com/blogs/PermaLink,guid,76fc0b7e-6579-4f95-9117-31d51e787118.aspx">GameDaily.com</a>, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/supermariobrosds/news.html?sid=6146457&mode=recent">GameSpot.com</a>, and <a href="http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/games/index.blog?entry_id=1441857">Wired.com</a>.  It sounds like everyone is excited about the game.<br><br>

<li><b>Magnetica for the Nintendo DS</b> has received a North American release date of June 5.  Check out a short preview of the game courtesy of <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/697/697673p1.html">IGN.com</a>.<br><br>

The hotspots will give Nintendo DS owners free access to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Over 500 of the stores, including Toys R Us, Gamestation, GAME, and Smyths Toys, will also install "Download Stations" that provide players free downloadable demos.
