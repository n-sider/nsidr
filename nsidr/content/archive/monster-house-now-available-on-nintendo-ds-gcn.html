<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-07-19-monsterhouse-nintendo.jpg" border="0" align="right" alt="THQ's Monster House for Nintendo DS, GameCube and Game Boy">THQ's Monster House is now available on <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=180148">Nintendo DS</a> and <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=160732">Game Boy Advance</a> for $29.99 and <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=220606">Nintendo GameCube</a> for $39.99.  Monster House is based on the <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/monsterhouse/site/">Sony Pictures</a> film of the same name starring animated character DJ and his two friends Chowder and Jenny.</p>

<p>Like the movie, the game follows the three of you as you're confronted with an evil house that gobbles up all who approach it.  Each character is equipped with a snazzy water gun and has their own "unique actions and abilities" to combat this architectural foe.</p>
