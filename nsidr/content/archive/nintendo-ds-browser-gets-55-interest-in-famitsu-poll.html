<p>Portable Planet, <a href="http://www.portableplanet.co.uk/dsnews.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1152423381&archive=&start_from=&ucat=2">reporting on a survey</a> in Weekly Famitsu's July 21 issue, takes note of a survey conducted by Famitsu.com on their interest in the upcoming <cite>Nintendo DS Browser</cite>, based on Opera technology.</p>

<p>55.3% of respondents showed definite interest in Web browsing on the DS, citing touch pen support, being able to check their e-mail from their DS, and being able to use the software at free Wi-Fi access points as reasons they were interested in the software.  27.7% indicated they weren't interested, giving reasons ranging from lack of wireless LAN access to lack of Flash and other plugin support and already being in posession of a portable Web-browsing device.  17% were unsure about the Browser software entirely.</p>

<p>The Nintendo DS Browser software <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2251">will be released in Japan</a> July 24.  No announcements have been regarding release in other territories at this time, though rumor has it Nintendo is at least looking at getting it out the door this year in America.</p>
