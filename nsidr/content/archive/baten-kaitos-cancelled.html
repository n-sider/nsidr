<p><a href="http://namco-ch.net/list_game/list.php?hid=26">Namco's  DS release list</a>, which <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1247">previously listed Baten Kaitos</a> as in development for Nintendo DS, has been updated recently, and the Baten Kaitos title has been removed.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the same list now confirms that Namco is working on a Tales title for the DS, which was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1362">announced recently</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Samer from <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/">N-Sider Forums</a> for the tip.</p>
