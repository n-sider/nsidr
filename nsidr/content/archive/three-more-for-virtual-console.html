It's Monday once again and you all know what that means!<br />
<br />
VIRTUAL CONSOLE MONDAY<br />
<br />

<ul><i>
  <li>Tennis</i> (NES, 1-2 players, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Space Harrier II</i> (Sega Genesis, 1 player, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Military Madness</i> (TurboGrafx16, 1-2 players, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
This week brings a brazen assortment of marginally un-exciting titles, chief among them the relatively lackluster Genesis port of the Sega classic <i>Space Harrier</i>.  With Wii Sports bundled into every Wii box, NES Tennis is less than a value proposition as well.  Perhaps here the shining star is Military Madness, a hex-grid, turn-based strategy game which takes place on the moon.  After all, it did win the prestigious "Best  Military Strategy Game" award from Video Games & Computer Entertainment magazine in 1990!<br />

Updates to Virtual Console occur at 9 a.m. Pacific time, which works out to 10 a.m. Mountain time, 11 a.m. Central time, and noon Eastern time.
