<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3603-1.jpg" width="125" height="325" class="image_nostyle" /></div>Last week I mentioned that I had sharp pains in my feet and lower legs&#8212;those have thankfully vanished and this week I was back at it in full force.<br />
<br />
I decided that if I were to continue doing the free run every day I would put my shoes on before I started running in place. This has helped immensely and I highly suggest it to anyone who has started to experience pain.<br />
<br />
What can I say about week three? The end is nearing and I'm starting to really feel the effects of <i>Wii Fit</i>. As of today I've lost seven pounds since I started, and an entire BMI point. Not too bad for a piece of plastic.<br />
<br />
I've unlocked everything there is to unlock, save for a few stamps&#8212;the unlocks for those seem to be based on days of the week and not tied to how much you do certain activities&#8212;and I have to say I'm becoming somewhat bored with the offerings of Wii Fit. It's not that the activities are boring by themselves, it's just that they are simply becoming repetitive. I understand that there are only so many ways to provide video exercises and other activities, but a little more variation would be nice.<br />
<br />
The free run, for example, takes you all around the island, but it's the same path for the entire half-hour. You run the island about three times in this mode, but there are tons of raised areas with bridges and paths that you never get to go to.  It's simply disappointing.<br />
<br />
I'm finding it difficult to continue my eating habits unchanged.  Since I began this experiment I've definitely become more health-conscious and have started to read the caloric content of what I eat more often. Even though I know what I'm eating is probably destroying any benefits that Wii Fit may be offering, for the sake of this experiment, I've continued on with my Subway subs, McDonald's burgers, and tasty chicken sushi (alright, at least that one's healthy).<br />

</div>Every time I do my daily body test I am eager to see where the slider lands. Every day seems to be a roller coaster that luckily always ends up at a point lower than it was the day before.<br />
<br />
Since May had 31 days in it, my one month "goal" ends on Thursday of next week. Next weekend I'll be posting my final thoughts so you can see exactly what it was that I ate, how much time I ultimately put into this program, and whether or not Wii Fit by itself can change your lifestyle for the better.<br />
