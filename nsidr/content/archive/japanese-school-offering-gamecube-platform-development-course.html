<p>Students at Japan's computer academy HAL, will use GameCube development tools as part of their courses, according to TotalGames.net. Instead of primarily using PCs, students will now be able to learn console development in-depth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><font size="2">"SN Systems' software development kit for GameCube is the development system currently used in leading game companies," said a spokesperson from HAL "This agreement means a student can now for the first time study software development for Nintendo's powerful GameCube on the same level as a professional. What's more, as we already have the Game Boy Advance development kit, it has also become possible for our students to work on compatibility and interlocking software development."</font></p>
