Mere hours after rumors that Chrono Trigger had made an appearance in the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine V-Jump, Square-Enix made it official with a <a href="http://www.square-enix.co.jp/ctds/">teaser site</a>:  Chrono Trigger will be hitting the Nintendo DS in Japan this winter, with releases in other territories sure to follow.<br />

Details are sparse at best, but the Jump story references an "enhanced port" situation, perhaps similar to the releases of Final Fantasies V and VI on the Game Boy Advance.  Such an interpretation would likely keep the SNES version's overall structure and appearance while adding small gameplay and script tweaks, along with potential bonus quests, characters, or items.  With truly concrete details regarding the game's features hard to come by, however, this is speculation at best.<br />
<br />
The teaser site features a clock ticking in an audibly recognizable fashion, likely leading up to the eventual full unveiling of the title, which the Japanese Square-Enix website suggests will occur on July 7th.  We'll be holding our breaths.<br />

<b>Update:</b> Official PR has been released, and more features have been gleamed.  The game is shooting for a "holiday" release in North America, and will feature wireless play in some capacity, touch-screen functionality of similarly vague capacity, and an extra dungeon.
