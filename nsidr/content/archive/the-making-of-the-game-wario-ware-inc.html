<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: Explain how this game began development? </b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Goro Abe</b>: Well the original version on the Game Boy Advance became a great hit for us. One thing we soon decided is that there needed to be a multiplayer version of this game available. Although the development period was short for this game, we definitely did the best we could in providing a really unique experience independent of the GBA version. There are some mini-games not in the GBA version, as well as modes that completely change the way you played the older mini-games.</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: This game is excellent. Bringing it to the big screen will bring more fans.</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abe</b>: Well one thing we decided to include is the ability to plug in your Game Boy Advance and use it as a controller.</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: The game is very unique. Did you feel it would succeed as a Nintendo title?</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abe</b>: The <i>Mario Party</i> series is probably the closest competitor as a party game to Wario Ware Inc. The funny thing is, it is produced by our same company. I think overall the enjoyment of Wario Ware Inc. is in its speed and pick-up-and-play nature.</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: I think what people find interesting is the "moment of action" and one button gameplay. It allows you to try and surprise the player and test his reflexes and skill.</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abe</b>: We wanted the games to be simple and fun. Catching a fly with chopsticks, running from place to place all at once, were some of the games that were easy to make multiplayer. The ranking system is very important for reference.</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: The multiplayer is interesting also because you can interfere with the other player.</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Mino Watanabe</b>: It allows you to help determine the winner even after your own demise. Constantly keeping everyone in the game involved.</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: Will Wario always be greedy?</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Watanabe</b>: Of course!</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: By the way. Which character do you think will be most popular? </b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abe</b>: Wario. He is the president of Wario Ware Inc.</p>

<p><b>Watanabe</b>: Not my personal favorite, but yeah Wario.</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: How did the development process go. Most of the staff had just finished developing the GBA version right? </b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Watanabe</b>: When considering the eight main game modes, you might not know we spent 8 hours a time in a humid room discussing them. Perhaps that is why those games are so weird and crazy.</p>

<p><b>Ryutaro Takahashi</b>: Yeah. Only under that circumstance could we have created "Doctor Says" (one of the game modes).</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: It's wonderful yet strange!</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Takahashi</b>: Wario hates bananas!</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: The sound work is pretty amazing. How was that decided?</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Takahashi</b>: Well, I also regard the sound effects as considerably fastidious. The staff contributed the voice, and all the sound effects were hand made.</p>

<p><b>Watanabe</b>: A lot of credit has to be given to the sound director.</p></blockquote>

<p><font color="#405CC6"><b>Q: A final word from the development staff?</b></font></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Takahashi</b>: When a friend comes over, this game will be the topic of talk. There are just so many games and so many different competitive modes. It's just so unique and so fun. You need to try it.</p>

<p><b>Watanabe</b>: No matter how good you get a particular game, there is always a harder mode for you to try and master.</p>

<p><b>Abe</b>: Even if you played the GBA version, you need to play this edition of the game. The multiplayer aspect is unbelievable. The game even supports 16 player tournaments!!</p></blockquote>
