<p>I freely admit my bias towards the following two titles.  I want them, and therefore you must look at them.  Fortunately, the screens <i>are</i> somewhat new.</p>

<p>First up, we have <i>Custom Robo: Battle Revolution</i>, which is scheduled for a North American release on May 10, 2004.  The game sports both an extensive one player RPG mode and multiplayer battle.

<p>Next up are screens for <i>WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Game$</i>, which is scheduled for a North American release on April 5, 2004.  With over 200 mini-games, four-player gaming has never looked better.</p>
