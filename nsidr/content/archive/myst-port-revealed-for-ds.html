<br />
Myst is an adventure game set in a unique sci-fi world where the player, as the Stranger, is transported to the world of Myst after discovering a book with the same name. With no choice left but to explore this new world, the Stranger must solve puzzles and find more books which will transport him to other Ages. After exploring all the available Ages, the Stranger can return to the original world of Myst with all the information needed to complete the adventure.<br />
<br />
The gameplay is all centered around exploring and solving puzzles. Clues are given while exploring the different worlds to solve these puzzles. This all takes place from a first-person perspective to increase the level of immersion&mdash;something that Myst is famous for.<br />
<br />
The code is being rewritten from the ground up specifically with the DS in mind, as well as an all new Age, Rime. New graphics, movies, and sounds will accompany the new world and the old, and the pre-existing movies and sounds will be re-mastered. The game will also allow multiple save files for different players.<br />
<br />
No release date has yet been announced.
