<p>Nintendo's submitted the DS Lite for FCC approval, and as a result, we get our <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/08/nintendo-ds-lite-live-shots/">first  real photos of the device</a> courtesy Engadget, who's taken the <a href="https://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/oet/forms/blobs/retrieve.cgi?attachment_id=626995&native_or_pdf=pdf">original FCC application</a> and color-corrected the harsh pictures.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-02-09-ds_lite_raw.jpg" alt="DS Lite in the raw from FCC submission"></p>

<p>The shots reveal some new features of the device, such as the side-mounted power switch, large-looking stylus and its center-side slot, and the removable slot 2 cover.  (Slot 2 is used for Game Boy Advance games and Option Paks.)</p>

<p>In addition to these shots, Kotaku <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/top/weve-got-the-ds-lite-instruction-manual-153659.php">has the instruction manual</a> (interestingly, they got the <em>North American</em> manual &mdash; could the device's release be closer than we previously thought?)  According to the manual, the power switch is a momentary one rather than a hard on/off switch like the GBA SP; you must hold it up briefly before the power will actually switch off.  Battery life may also be improved, as the manual claims 15-19 hours of life on the lowest brightness setting.</p>

<p>The device's software also appears largely unchanged from the original model; Nintendo's not keen to change up the platform despite persistent hopes from fans that PictoChat would become a Wi-Fi Connection application &mdash; the stable platform is, as with all other consoles, key, though the brightness icon on the main screen has been adapted to cycle through the backlight's four levels of brightness.</p>

<p>No announcement is yet forthcoming from Nintendo of America regarding release plans, though the rumor mill is currently saying "May".  We'll let you know, of course, when we have more.</p>
