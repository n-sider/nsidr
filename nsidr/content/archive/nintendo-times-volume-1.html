<blockquote><p>In a recent Famitsu column <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=982">Masahiro Sakurai</a> confirmed that a group of former SNK employees were hired into the HAL Laboratory sector of Nintendo Co., Ltd, and were the lead group in the Kirby: Labyrinth of the Mirror.</p>

<p>Sakurai also explained how Capcom subsidiary Flagship got involved in the project. Sakurai and Yoshiki Okamoto had discussions about a collaboration almost two years ago, and even though they have both resigned from their respective groups, the deal still went through. Flagship is writing the scenario and helping design the game. Sakurai is still overseeing the project even though he is not directly involved. Finally, Mr. Sakurai hints a contract with Nintendo may have been signed for a future project.</p></blockquote><br>

One thing that we do know is that Mr. Miyamoto is working closely on <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=547">Super Mario 128</a></i> and a secret <i>Nintendo DS title</i>.</p></blockquote><br>

<blockquote><p>Nintendo announced <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=679">Stage Debut</a></i> during the E3 2003 show. The game is an evolution of a group of former Nintendo 64DD titles released under the Mario Artist series. <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=364">Talent Maker</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=375">Polygon Maker</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=376">Paint Studio</a></i> all combine with a plethora of new ideas to form the GameCube <i>Stage Debut</i>. Director <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=370">Yoichi Yamada</a> has been working on this title for two and a half years now. The game is going to be introduced down the line perhaps as a launch platform included with 1-2 new peripherals along with e-Card and GBA connectivity.</p></blockquote><br>

<blockquote><p>Several Nintendo R&D big wigs have departed from the company over the past year. These untimely events are credited to retirement and opportunities with other developers. The biggest departure is courtesy of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=581">Masayuki Uemura</a>, the original General Manager of the R&D2 team. Uemura oversaw the development of numerous proprietary technology development used in hardware and software for Nintendo. Uemura also produced several games like <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=356">Marvelous</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=270">Golf</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=357">Sutte Hakun</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=63">Kirby Tilt' N Tumble</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=232">Soccer</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=72">Super Mario Bros. DX</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=343">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX,</a></i> and others. Uemura has officially retired from Nintendo, and serves only as an advisor.

<p>Nintendo of America also lost a few big producers like <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=531">Andy Hieke</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1293">Scott Tsumura</a>. Hieke was one of the big producers at NOA Treehouse and has worked on games like <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=42">Ridge Racer 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=43">StarCraft 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=16">F1 World Grand Prix</a>, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=55">Bionic Commando: Elite Forces</a></i>, and <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=58">Crystalis:DX</a></i>. Scott K. Tsumura was formerly the president of Nintendo Software Technology Corporation, where he oversaw the development and management of all NST produced software. Both employees left Nintendo of America to pursue opportunities with other game development groups.</p></blockquote>
