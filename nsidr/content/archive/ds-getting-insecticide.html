Publisher Gamecock Media Group and developer Crackpot Entertainment have announced they are bringing <i>Insecticide</i> to the PC and Nintendo DS this holiday season.<br />
<br />
Insecticide is described as a "hard-boiled, fast-shooting detective game set in a festering futuristic city where bugs have evolved as the planet's dominant race." The 3rd person action-adventure mixes combat with story-based investigation. Players will use Detective Chrys Liszt's unique insect abilities and creative weaponry to tackle the task at hand with partner Roachy Caruthers.<br />
<br />
The game is being developed by industry veterans who have worked with such titles as Grim Fandango, Sam & Max Hit the Road, and Dark Forces: Jedi Knight 1 & 2.
