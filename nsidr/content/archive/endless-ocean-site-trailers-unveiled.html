<i>Endless Ocean</i>, the new title for the game formerly known by its Japanese title <i>Forever Blue</i>, now has <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/rfbj/index.html">an official site</a>. With it, a variety of trailers are available for view.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the site, floating links allow the visitor to check out footage from the game, with one being a simple slide show. The first link's trailer shows the diver inspecting coral reefs. Halfway through, a flashing, bleeping dot appears over some vegetation. Then, by what seems like a button press, it zooms in on the vegetation and a small group of fish. Near the end, a sort of HUD and menu appear when the diver stops. In the upper left corner, the compass can be seen, as well as what looks like a depth indicator and air amount beside it. At the bottom, a sort of scrolling menu allows selection of certain actions. The menu shows a button with a fish eating, which is used in the trailer to feed the school if fish nearby.<br />
<br />
The second trailer has the diver swimming with different underwater life, starting with a huge manta ray and then a sea turtle. When he comes upon a certain fish, the small point on screen (where the Wii Remote is aimed) is aimed at a fish and then the point becomes a small hand, petting the fish. After this happens, the game indicates something happened with the fish with a small sound and flash, though what happened is unsure. The hand also becomes a pointing finger, which looks to "tap" the fish, causing another small flash over the animal. Later, petting a particular fish fails to produce the action, so the diver feeds it, which then causes it to happen. After this, a screen pops up with information on the fish (such as it's scientific name). It seems that winning good favor with the animals plays a role in the game.<br />
<br />
The third, and largest, trailer shows the diver swimming with a small group of a particular type of dolphin. The "squeek" that dolphin use to communicate can be heard. The diver starts to pet one specific dolphin, and here the bottom of the screen shows a small bubble with question marks in it. Once the action occurs with the flash and sound, the bubble says something and the dolphin swims off rapidly and then seems to play with the diver.<br />
<br />
The final trailer demonstrates the Wi-Fi connection and so shows two divers swimming through the ocean. Communication looks to be a series of responses and comments prescribed to the directional pad and selected that way through menus.<br />

Though the site is in Japanese, it is welcome to have new footage, video, and information on this game. Endless Ocean is being developed by Arika and published by Nintendo. It is due for release October 29.
