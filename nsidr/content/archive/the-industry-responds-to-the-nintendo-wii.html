"Oh, we'll get used to it, just like 'Dreamcast.'" That's what some people around here are saying about Wii's newly announced handle. Does that make it a good brand name? C'mon...how about coming up with something cool that you don't need to "get used to"? How about one that just impresses right from the get-go? Something like..."Revolution"? Hmm?" - Dan Hsu

Michael Goodman, senior analyst of media and entertainment strategies at The Yankee Group, believes the name change is a mistake. "I thought Revolution had much more meaning," he told GameSpot. "It was an apt description for the console. It was a revolutionary design ... the controller is pretty revolutionary. Wii just doesn't do it for me. How do we even pronounce this? WEEE? I'm not sure this is technically a word. What is a WEE, W-I-I?"

Matt Atwood: We always stated that Revolution was a code name. While it indicates the disruptive nature of the system, we wanted a name that represents all inclusiveness, because that's a huge point of the system.  It's not about you or me - it's about Wii.  So, it's basically a different kind of a system.

So why announce the name now and not at the show? By letting the gaming community vent now about the name, they will be less distracted as launch titles for the system are announced and initial reports about what it's like to play the games begin to come in. Also, said Kaplan, "We want people to understand our approach before we get to E3. [Also], it's really noisy at E3 and I don't think we would have had the chance to explain how we came to the name."

"I was one of those people who were hoping they'd just leave it 'Revolution,'" said Brian Crecente, editor of game blog Kotaku and video game writer for the Rocky Mountain News. "I really think this boils down to Nintendo trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist."

What does Nintendo have to say to the naysayers? "We believe people will move past that issue," said Perrin Kaplan, president of marketing and corporate affairs at Nintendo. "Many top companies have successfully used names or phrases that might seem odd at first blush: Virgin for an airline, Caterpillar for construction equipment, Yahoo! for Internet services, Naked for juice, Prius for a car, Napster for a Web site."

Wii are just as surprised as you are about Nintendo's recent unveiling. Wii are just not sure how to respond to it (and wii have been carefully analyzing their hype-filled letter), and wii have been making plenty of jokes. Honestly, we thought of a few (rather negative) things: 1. The marketing department is dyslexic, and tried to copy Apple. 2. April fool's joke that Nintendo forgot to send out earlier. 3. Someone tainted the ventilation systems at Nintendo headquarters to release mind-expanding substances.

Perrin Kaplan: I think it's just a reminder that the system can be played individually or be played by a lot of people. It is for people of all sized and shapes. It's really a system for everybody. It's a system for the core gamers. It's a system for the people who are just going to be re-entering gaming. I think that's what people can get from it.

"NGage and Gizmondo are cool names," said Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles, referring to previous products aimed at gamers. "But consumers relate to the coolness of the product, not the name."
