<h3>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</h3>

<p>Activision's assault of franchises on the Game Boy Advance continues with <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</i>, Activision's highest selling property to date. One of the first announced USA launch titles, <i>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</i> is one of the most impressive looking titles, which is definitely a surprise after the disappointing Game Boy Color editions.</p>

<p><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/tonyhawk2gba01.jpg"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/tonyhawk2gba01_th.jpg" NOSAVE border="0" ALIGN="right" width="205" height="120"></a>What makes this game look so impressive, is that instead of going with the usual high color rainbow palette, the development team decided to use a blander, realistic color scheme while using an isometic camera to give it a similar look to the one found on the Playstation and Nintendo 64 edition. The game will feature twelve pro skaters, and a multitude of combos that made past installments so well received by game players.</p>

<p>No details regarding multiplayer, but Activision will have the game playable for E3 and is adamant about having the game ready for the US launch of the Game Boy Advance.</p>
