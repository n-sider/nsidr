<h3>There's No Such Thing as "Free"</h3>

<p>Reuters recently published an article that examined
the pressure the three console manufacturers are
facing from publishers and analysts to lower the price
of their respective home consoles for the upcoming
holiday season. 

<p>The author addressed the side requesting price
drops - noting that NPDFunworld showed declines in
hardware sales of up to 42 percent compared to June of
last year.  The article did not however touch on why
the console manufacturers may prefer to keep prices as
is.

<p>Some believe Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have an
obligation to the development community to lower the
prices of their consoles.  Afterall the more consoles
that are available in homes, the greater the
opportunity publishers will have to sell their
software.  This presents more benefits for those
producing games than it does for those producing the
hardware.  Console technology doesn't come cheap - it costs millions of dollars for initial research and development and hundreds of dollars for each set of chips. 
One must keep in mind, the console makers also have an
obligation to their company and shareholders.

<p>Even now the console manufacturers are relying on
the sale of their in-house software to make-up for the
significant losses in hardware.  They are losing money
on each hardware unit sold.  And to rub a little more
salt into the wound, prices of games at retail have
lowered significantly.  

<p>Of course, much of that has been attributed to
lowered licensing fees.  Nintendo recently lowered the
fees it chargers publishers to make games for
GameCube.  

<p>Although licensing fees were lowered by only a few
dollars, it's quickly becoming standard for games to
be sold from anywhere between $20 - $40 (a nearly $30
deduction from the standard $50 price tag).  If a
hardware price drop occurs, the trio of console
manufacturers will be losing even more money which may
not be compensated by software sales.  Since software
prices are already so low, it will be difficult for
them to replenish the losses.

<p>Of course if more hardware units are sold, there's
the potential for the sale of more software.  However,
with consumers demanding lower and lower prices, it's
going to be tough for the console manufacturers to
make a substantial enough return to offset the
continued expenses.  

<p>Sony is currently the leader of the pack and the
manufacturer in the position to offer lower hardware
prices.  It is afterall the market leader with over 50
million PlayStation 2s sold worldwide.  The Xbox and
GameCube are trailing far behind with just over 10
million each sold worldwide.  If a hardware price drop
occurs, such a decision will be initiated by Sony.

<p>When Sony and Microsoft cut the price of their
consoles by $20 at the recent Electronic Entertainment
Expo, Nintendo followed a strategy of its own. 
Nintendo has opted to continue its free game promotion
and in another deal offer its GameCube bundled with
the Game Boy Player.  (Both the Game Boy Player and a
standard video game retail for $50.  Do the math. 
While priced at $150, both deals essentially make the
GameCube itself $99.)

<p>Microsoft has done similar deals with its Xbox,
offering two "freebie" games with the purchase of a
console.  Since Microsoft is shoving online gaming
down everyone's throat (a simple observation), it
might be a better idea to bundle its network adaptor
and an online game.  

<p>Sony is already doing this with its PlayStation 2 -
bundling its network adaptor with the console and selling it for $200.  Sega also once did this with the Dreamcast.

<p>Those who don't want all this extra product aren't
always offered a second choice. Luckily for the
consoles makers, whenever someone says "free" to an
American, they'll come-a-running.

<p>Despite the apparent positives, would the console
manufacturers be better off offering consumers zero
"freebies" and instead only their base console? 
Should Nintendo axe its free game/Game Boy Player
strategy and sell the GameCube alone for $99?

<p>It's no doubt something they've considered.  For
one reason or another they've chosen their current
route.  Is Nintendo being selfish for essentially
forcing consumers to make the choice of buying its
Game Boy Player or one of its published games?  Most
likely but with continued lowered software and
hardware prices, Nintendo has found an ingenious way to
make-up some of that lost money.

<p>End.
