<p>Eurogamer has <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=64747">an interview with Tetsuya Mizuguchi</a>, creator of <cite>Space Channel 5</cite> and <cite>Rez</cite> and now heading up Q Entertainment, makers of <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=994">Meteos</a></cite> and <cite>Lumines</cite>, that they conducted at the recently-wrapped E3 2006 show.</p>

<p>In it, Eurogamer asks Mizuguchi about his feelings about Wii:</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Eurogamer:</b> You're currently working on Xbox 360, PS2, PSP, DS, mobile - the only things you're not working on seem to be the only things with innovative controls. Do you have any ideas and future plans for Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 3?</p>

<p><b>Tetsuya Mizuguchi:</b> Oh yeah.</p>

<p><b>Eurogamer:</b> What do you think of the Nintendo Wii?</p>

<p><b>Tetsuya Mizuguchi:</b> Nintendo Wii is very interesting, a very special controller, a very original style. Too special, maybe, if you want to make the game not only Wii, but for other platforms, because you want to give the game the best chance. I'm really interested in the style, though.</p>

<p><b>Eurogamer:</b> Maybe developers will be happier to take the risk because they're happier working on something so unusual.</p>

<p><b>Tetsuya Mizuguchi:</b> Yeah. Yeah. At my stage, I'm watching what's happening in the future, planning how to combine the music, the visualisation, the futuristic - a Rez kind of experience. I don't mean I'm making a Rez sequel, but I'm thinking about the future, and what kind of games I can make in terms of high-def sounds and visuals.</p></blockquote>
