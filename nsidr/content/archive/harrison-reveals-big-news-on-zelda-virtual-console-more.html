<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1134">George Harrison</a>, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing and corporate communications, sat down for a <a href="http://gonintendo.com/?p=4648">chat</a> with registered users of Nintendo.com and its online Camp Hyrule event currently in progress.</p>

<p>Many of the questions posed to Harrison allowed him to reflect on the challenges of his job marketing Nintendo products. Harrison especially hopes to have a successful marketing campaign for the upcoming launch of Wii.  "I've been with Nintendo for almost 15 years, and we have had many successes," he recalled.  "I think certainly the launch of Nintendo 64 was a phenomenal experience that we hope to replicate with Wii."</p>

<p>Harrison also spoke about some of the company's upcoming software releases such as the highly anticipated Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  Of particular note, Harrison confirmed which controllers can be used with the Nintendo GameCube and Wii releases of the game.  The GameCube controller can only be used to play the GameCube version of Twilight Princess.  It will not be, as previously speculated, compatible with the Wii version.</p>

<p>Finally, Harrison notes his excitement for the games that will appear on the Wii Virtual Console.  He said it's an opportunity for people who enjoy retro experiences as well as those who've yet to play them.  Harrison also left us a thought to ponder.  "Remember, there are other secrets of the virtual console that we won't reveal until we get closer to launch."</p>

<p>Oh, Harrison, you tease.</p>
