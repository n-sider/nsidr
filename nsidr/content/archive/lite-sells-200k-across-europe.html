<p>The numbers are in for the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> in Europe.  Nintendo of Europe revealed today that <a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/news/article.do?elementId=xZZe1-VBn8vtPg1xXaOuW1cBrYLfZllB">200,000 units were sold</a> in the ten days since the console hit stores June 23, bringing DS's installed base in that territory to 5 million.</p>

<p>NoE also dropped a few software sales numbers.  With <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2183">the special <cite>Dalmatian & Friends</cite> edition</a> of <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967">Nintendogs</a></cite>, sales for that series have reached 3 million across Europe.  <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a></cite> has been a lesser but still-notable success, getting 600,000 copies into the hands of European DS owners.  <cite>Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training</cite> (<cite>Brain Age</cite> to American types) has sold 250,000 since its release in that territory.</p>

<p>Europe has been the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2182">exclusive home of the black DS Lite</a> since the hardware launched in that territory.  The black console was apparently so sought-after that one of its original shipments was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2235">stolen by Hong Kong pirates</a>.</p>
