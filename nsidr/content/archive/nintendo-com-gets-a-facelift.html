<p>Nintendo of America's main presence, <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo.com</a>, has received a redesign.</p>

<p>Gone is the upcoming/recent-release-centric focus of the old site's homepage, replaced with what appears to be a more news/community-oriented layout, slightly reminiscent of the old <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2005/">E3 2005</a> site, focussed on news items and pieces written by the guys at Nintendo Power.  And yeah, the pieces are accompanied by the little cel-shaded headshots of the authors.  (<a href="http://www.nintendo.com/mediaFiles/DrHFr2f_-KNNymZtiphBdtXX0uWCez0Y.png">This guy</a> in particular looks like the perfect person to tell you about Nintendo's "bumper crop" of holiday releases.)</p>

<p>The site now also appears to be segmented into various channels, covering Nintendo's various systems.  Each channel offers some system information as well as links to game information and official websites for the latest releases for that system.</p>

<p>The verdict?  It seems to be a decent design.  I'll personally miss the immediate linking to my <a href="http://store.nintendo.com/">Nintendo Store</a> orders and such that I'd get from the front page (those items are now found under <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/cpp/mynintendo/myNintendo.do">My Nintendo</a>), but the site certainly looks a lot more modern and the smattering of artwork from releases long-gone is now long-gone as well, which is a welcome change for those interested in what Nintendo is doing <em>now</em>.</p>
