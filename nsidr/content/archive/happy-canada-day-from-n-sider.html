N-Sider would like to wish all of our Canadian readers a Happy Canada day.  Remember to bring your Wii Remote to any fireworks displays you attend; maybe you can convince some impressionable young kid that you're controlling them.<br />
<br />
If you're of age, please drink responsibly, and don't drive if you do.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the long weekend!
