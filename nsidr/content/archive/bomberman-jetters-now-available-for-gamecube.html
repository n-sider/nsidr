<p>Majesco squeezed the GameCube action-title <i>Bomberman Jetters</i> into North American retailers this week.</p> 

<p>This is said to be the sequel to the Hudson Soft-developed <i>Bomberman Generation</i>, which was released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. <i>Bomberman Jetters</i> is retailing for a price of $19.99.</p>  

<p>Both the single player and traditional multi-player modes return.  For more information, visit the official <a href="http://www.majescogames.com/bombermanj/index.htm">Bomberman Jetters</a> website.</p>

<p>And just FYI, Bomberman is not a terrorist.</p>
