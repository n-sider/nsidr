Nearly 60 percent of Japanese gamers polled in a recent survey by Japanese news service C-News feel the PlayStation 3 is the most appealing of the next generation consoles.  Meanwhile, 8 percent chose the Nintendo Revolution and 2 percent the Xbox 360, with the remaining 30 percent remaining undecided.  The survey was conducted with 1,000 Japanese consumers from the ages of 10 to 59.<br>
<br>
People generally chose the PlayStation 3 because they feel it will feature the largest range of software and be technologically superior to other platforms.  Despite this, 40 percent said they would only be willing to pay for a PlayStation 3 if it was less than $224.<br>
<br>
When asked what type of games they would most like to play on a next-generation console, 80 percent of the surveyed consumers said existing franchises such as Dragon Quest and Super Mario, 60 percent said original titles, and 35 percent said remakes of existing titles.  Finally, the response to the genre of games desired on next-generation consoles is as follows:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Role-Playing Games - 71.2 percent
<li>Simulations - 52.8 percent
<li>Action - 47.9 percent
<li>Adventure - 41.1 percent
<li>Shooters - 23.4 percent
  </ul>
