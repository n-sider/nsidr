On October 18th through the 21st, the Los Angeles Convention Center will host IDG's E for All expo&mdash;and Nintendo has announced today they will be an anchor exhibitor at the show.<br />
<br />
E for All was created this year as a consumer-focussed exposition for "people who are passionate about video games and everything related".  It will feature hands-on trials of new products before they are available for purchase, and is intended to boost the holiday shopping season.
