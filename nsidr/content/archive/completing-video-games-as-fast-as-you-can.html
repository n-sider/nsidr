<p>PlanetQuake has started a new hobby for people called "speed runs".  The site has been hosting these for several months now in which players send in videos of them completing certain games as fast as they can.  Some of the times are pretty impressive.  Check out the links below for some tips on how to complete these "speed runs".</p>

<font size="2">
<p><ul>
<li><a href="http://planetquake.com/sda/mp/">Metroid Prime</a> (1 hour, 4 minutes)
<li><a href="http://planetquake.com/sda/other/mzm.html">Metroid Zero Mission</a> (30 minutes, 22 seconds)
<li><a href="http://planetquake.com/sda/other/supermetroid.html">Super Metroid</a> (36 minutes)
<li><a href="http://planetquake.com/sda/other/mario64.html">Super Mario 64</a> (thanks to a glitch that allows you to only collect 16 stars, 26 minutes, 1 second)
  </ul></p>
