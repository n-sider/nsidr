<p>The <a href="http://www.the-king-of-games.com/kog/series005.html">King of Games</a>, a Japanese online games retailer, has hooked up with Nintendo to help the company promote the 20th anniversary of the Legend of Zelda series.  To think we've been exploring the hills of Hyrule for 20 years now...brings a small tear of nostalgia to my eye.</p>

<p>King of Games has made several Nintendo collectibles available including t-shirts and customizable 'dot' figurines.  Check out the full array of items <a href="http://www.the-king-of-games.com/kog/series005.html">here</a>.  The release of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=911">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a> later this year will be a very nice anniversary present, no?</p>
