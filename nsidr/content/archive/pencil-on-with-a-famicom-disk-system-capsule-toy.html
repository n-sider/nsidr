Do you particularly enjoy the corporate mascot of the Famicom Disk System, the adorable yellow Disk-kun?  Got a pocket full of hundred yen coins?  Is the year 1987?  Do you have a variety of <i>stationary-related needs</i>, able to be sated only with tiny capsule machine toys created specifically for a person like you?  Search no further!!  This is the furthest you have to search.<br />

Twist the crank, and receive one of the eight shocking parts of the Famicom Disk Stationary series!  Each one has a handy purpose.  The one I purchased, based solely on the original <i>Metroid</i> disk label stickers that I could just barely see through the plastic capsule (which was sitting on a shelf in one of my local geek stores), happens to be a pencil holder.  It is well-suited for golf pencils, which are the only pencils children can use, because they have such tiny, breakable hands.<br />
<br />
Part of the appeal of these little toys is that you assemble the various pieces yourself.  Some of them, like the spring-loaded shoot-out hidden ballpoint pen look like they would be pretty fun to put together.  Others, like my pencil holder, are a little less complex.<br />

Each one includes a pamphlet with handy assembly instructions, as well as a reverse-side advertisement: a glimpse into the awesome toys you could have gotten but didn't.  Other possibilities: colored pencil, magnifying glass, memo pad, empty case, eraser, and scales to draw shapes.  There are also a variety of disk labels, which any self-respecting modern-day hoarder of useless Nintendo crap would never remove from the sticker sheet.<br />

The cost for these things at your local Japanese dork emporium?  315 yen a pop, only 200 more than what they would have cost twenty years ago.  WORTH IT
