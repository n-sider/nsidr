With the explosion of growth in the portable electronic sector of the market, it sounds as though Microsoft doesn't want to be left out, according to an article from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2006/tc20060126_148049.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech">BusinessWeek.com</a>.  They've gotten word that Microsoft is currently evaluating the feasibility of creating its own all-in-one portable gaming/music/entertainment device to compete with the likes of Apple's iPod and Sony's PSP.  If it decides to step into this industry, the company said it could use its Xbox brand to introduce the device to the market.  "I think the brand is an opportunity," Microsoft's Peter Moore told BusinessWeek.<br><br>

There are rumors that these discussions may eventually turn into actions.  In December 2005, Microsoft placed its MSN Music service under Robert Bach, president of the Entertainment & Devices division which includes the Xbox Games Division. Placing everything under the same division would make such an all-in-one portable device that much easier to coordinate.  We'll no doubt see what comes of these moves over the next few years.
