Via Japanese site <a href="http://eg.nttpub.co.jp/" target="_blank">EG</a> comes the <i>shocking</i> news that Capcom has officially announced a Nintendo DS successor to the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=547">Average</a> <i>Mega Man ZX</i>.<br />
<br />

Titled <i>Mega Man ZX Advent</i>, the game will be one of the few to do away with the sequential numbering system of games past.  Details are sketchy to non-existant but one might correctly speculate that the game will take place in a two-dimensional realm and consist of robots shooting things, hopefully without the assistance of last year's woeful mapping system.<br />
<br />
No release date, but information points to new details in February.
