<i>We're counting down to the Wii's launch with a daily look at what retro games we'd like to see on the Virtual Console.  Each also features a Virtual Console Likelihood rating.  A rating of 5 means the game has officially been announced for the service.

Sonic The Hedgehog, in 1991, blew away the SNES graphically speaking, and is still one of the best looking "16-bit generation" games to ever be released.  It's also smooth and, of course, fast.  SEGA almost took down Nintendo in the 1990s, almost entirely due to how awesome the Sonic series is.  Sure, it spawned its share of rip-off games (some of which turned out pretty good - see #28!) and its own merchandising extravaganza, but this was the 90's!  Everything popular got the crap merchandised out of it, from Mario to New Kids On The Block.<br />

It's still one of the best platforming games ever, and the fact that you can't save makes it very replayable, just like the Super Mario Bros. series.  The soundtrack is also extremely catchy - it won't get out of my head as I write this!  Until the Donkey Kong Country games came out for the SNES and proved that the Genesis wasn't the only system with amazing looking platformers, this series were the games to beat.  Super Mario World is very good, and is also one of the best, but the reason SEGA did so well is by making Sonic <i>seem </i> like more fun.  Whether it actually was or not is entirely up to you, but in my opinion, well...  Super Mario World isn't in this top 30 and Sonic is.  So there.<br />

A Mario game that is definitely making this list is Super Mario Kart for the SNES.  One of the best uses of Mode 7 technology on the SNES, and one of the most fun multiplayer games of the generation.  This game had it all, and at the time there was nothing else like it.  Heck, without Mario Kart's Battle Mode, games like Twisted Metal might not even have ever existed!  Maybe that's a bit of a stretch, but it's no stretch to say this game pioneered an entire subgenre of racing game, and the series has continued to perfect it, leading up to last year's Mario Kart DS, the pinnacle of the series so far.<br />

Super Mario Kart was great because it also had a very large track selection compared to most racing games, throw in the battle mode tracks, and that's a lot of ground to cover with tread marks.  Racing is great in multiplayer, and the banter between the two players is really what makes this game so special. Being able to gloat in person after hitting your friend with a red shell is one of my most fond memories of gaming, and I'm sure it's high on the list for many others.  Here's hoping we get to use the Wii remote to steer, but they might be saving that for the inevitable Wii edition of Mario Kart.
