<P>Courtesy of the latest Famitsu magazine, N-Sider has learned that the upcoming DS title <I>Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</i> will include the entire original game with complete voice acting, as well as two new multiplayer modes.</P>

<P>The two main game modes are allegedly called "Rebirth" (the new version) and either "Classic" or "Retro" depending on who you ask.</P>

<P>Rebirth will be the new DS version of the game with all the DS specific enhancements, while Classic mode will be the original game, as expected.  The game will include a host of new features: improved motion capture and redone character models, new traps and battles, full voice-acting, and smarter zombies that follow you from room to room.  In addition, there are a host of DS-specific features like quick access to the knife via the touchscreen, microphone features (allegedly you can breathe into the mic to resuscitate STARS team members), and the ability to reload without hitting up the pause menu.</P>

<P>But <i>that's not all</i>!  The DS version of <i>Resident Evil</i> will also include two new multiplayer game styles: a cooperative mode where two players work all gang-up like to waste on masses of zombies, and the perennial versus mode wherein the two of you slug it out to see who can pop more zombie watermelon heads. (It is unknown for the timebeing whether the multiplayer options will be available strictly through local-area DS play, or via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.)</P>

<P>The title's on track for a release in Japan this January, with a Q1 2006 release in North America and Europe.  Dig!</P>
