<p>According to a translation from Lik-Sang.com of an interview posted on iQue.com, iQue Ltd. chairman Wai Yen went on record saying the iQue would see a release outside China later this year.</p>

<p>Nintendo of America has yet to comment on any plans to release the unit in North America.  It's not known what specific countries, if any, the iQue will be further released in.</p>

<p>The iQue made its debut in China, as one of the first video game consoles ever released in the country, on November 12, 2003 via iQue Ltd. (in China it's known as Shinyu Technology Ltd.)  iQue Ltd. is partially funded by Nintendo Co., Ltd.  When beginning the design of the iQue, Wai Yen knew Nintendo's games would be perfect for the market.  The strong moral views of the government would allow Nintendo to easily gain acceptance to market its style of games.  The games Wai Yen and Nintendo intends to release in China include ports of Nintendo games previously released for the Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 platforms.</p>

<p>The iQue is a controller-style console that plugs directly into your television and comes with a 64 megabyte Flash Memory Card to store games.  The iQue box contains a serial number and password that allows consumers to download new titles to their iQue system at Nintendo retail partners throughout Shanghai, and eventually through the Internet. The Memory Card maintains a download log, so users can regain the previous game titles again free of charge if they want to play them again.</p>
