<p>For those of you who missed the pre-show yesterday, or if something 

got lost in translation while you were watching, <a 

href="www.planetgamecube.com">Planet GameCube</a> has posted a 

transcript of Iwata's speech.</p>

<p>The central theme of the talk was making videogames appealing to 

those who don't play anymore. He discussed how the DS had reached a 

portion of that market and how Wii would continue that.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<p>"When I became Nintendo president, we decided on a new goal for our 

company expanding the total number of people who play games.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we needed to target not only current gamers but 

two different types of consumers those who once played, but who had 

lost interest. And even those who had never played before."</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 20px; padding: 10px; background-color: 

rgb(238, 238, 238);"><font size="2">"One hand control with the Wii 

remote is just like the touch screen of DS. It breaks down a barrier to 

non-gamers and lapsed gamers. For anyone, it is comfortable. In 

addition, most lapsed gamers have wonderful memories of games they used 

to play. The virtual console aspect of Wii will bring them together 

again. And the virtual console will also act as a 'living laboratory' 

for simple, intuitive games."

<p><div style="margin: 0px 20px; padding: 10px; background-color: 

rgb(238, 238, 238);"><font size="2">"Using a design called 

'wii-connect-24', the console automatically enters standby mode without 

the fan running but still operating key functions and using power about 

the same as a miniature light bulb."
</font></div></p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 20px; padding: 10px; background-color: 

rgb(238, 238, 238);"><font size="2">"Beginning players will find 

control with the Wii remote intuitive and appealing. Serious gamers 

will find it a surprising way to attempt something they've already done 

many times before."</font></div></p><br>
