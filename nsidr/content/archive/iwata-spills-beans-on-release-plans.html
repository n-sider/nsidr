<p>Via Nintendo Gal comes <a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/index.php?/archives/444-Iwata-Talks-Revolution.html">a translated interview</a> with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> from an unnamed Japanese newspaper, where he talks about the upcoming Revoution console.</p>

<p>According to the translation, Nintendo is looking forward to a strategy similar to the release of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>: a US launch prior to Thanksgiving, followed by an end-of-year Japanese launch.  No mention is made of a European launch, but the now-departed <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick</a> has said previously Europeans would have their Revolutions <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1518">within "a few weeks"</a> of other territories.</p>

<p>Iwata also touches on the price point, saying that it will be a point that people will be willing to pay in order to play games, saying roughly "if you sell it at $500, and no-one buys it, then it's pointless".</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> Other news sources, such as GameSpot, are now <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6142572.html">confirming this story</a>.  The newspaper in question is <i>Sankei Shinbun</i>, and the unsellable price quoted by Iwata-san is actually 50,000 yen, or about US$434.</p>
