<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3189-1.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="image_styled" /></div>JeuxFrance.com has posted a handful of <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news20170_sonic-rush-adventure-se-devoile.html">new screenshots</a> of upcoming <i>Sonic Rush</i> sequel <i>Sonic Rush Adventure</i>.  The new shots seem to show a sort of Wild West motif to the screen decorations, interestingly.<br />

Sonic Rush Adventure is, last we heard, still on track for a fall release.
