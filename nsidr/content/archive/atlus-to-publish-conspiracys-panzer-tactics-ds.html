Atlus U.S.A. and Conspiracy Entertainment have announced an agreement for Atlus to publish <i>Panzer Tactics DS</i> for, as you might have guessed, the Nintendo DS.<br />
<br />
The game will feature a 100-hours-plus single-player campaign, the ability to play as the German Wehrmacht, the Red Army, or the Western Allies in unique campaigns, and both local and online multiplayer&mdash;the latter featuring an online ladder mode.<br />
<br />
Panzer Tactics DS is slated to drop to retail in the fourth quarter of this year.
