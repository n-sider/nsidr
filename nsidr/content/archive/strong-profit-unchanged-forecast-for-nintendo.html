<p>Nintendo's holiday season is characterized as "solid", backed up by the success of the DS in Japan and the triumvirate of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=967"><i>Nintendogs</i></a>,  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a>, and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a> and "gained momentum" of the DS in the US and Europe.  Currency-related gains helped boost October-November profit more than double over the prior year, from 21.3 million yen to 55.56 million.</p>

<p>With this success, Nintendo has achieved 92% of its current full business year forecast already &mdash; and opted to leave its unit sales forecasts unchanged.  Nintendo expects to sell 55 million Game Boy Advance titles over the next year alongside 40 million Nintendo DS titles and 30 million for GameCube.</p>

<p>Nintendo shares rose 23.3 percent during the first nine months of its current fiscal year, underperforming the Nikkei, which rose 40.2 percent.</p>
