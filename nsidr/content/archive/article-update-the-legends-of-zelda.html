<p>As I still get emails to this day asking when the next updates will be made to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/the-legends-of-zelda">The Legends of Zelda</a>, I figured I'd field the question as a delightfully entertaining newsbit.</p>

<p>So, there's good news, and bad news.  Let's start with the bad, since everyone loves bad news.  The Legends of Zelda, in its current format, will never be updating again.  Horrors upon horrors!</p>

<p>But enough of that.  There are TWO pieces of good news, to ease the impact of the previous world-ender.  First, to give you all something to munch on for a while, I went and completely rewrote the first two chapters.  Actually, I did that months and months ago.  But I never uploaded them!  So there they are.  The previous versions are complete garbage, in my opinion, so be sure to forget they even existed and memorize the new ones post haste.  Chapter two is actually several times larger than it used to be, so it's all good fun.</p>

<p>And good news part two is as follows.  Just because the Legends of Zelda is dead, it doesn't mean you've seen the end of the Zelda timeline on N-Sider.  We've got some stuff cookin' that's a billion times greater than the Legends of Zelda could ever hope to have been.  It won't be showing up any time soon, but rest secure in the knowledge that it's coming.  And if N-Sider's good at anything, it's promising amazingly great things that may or may not ever show up.</p>

<p>Check out the chapter revisions <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/the-legends-of-zelda">right here</a>, but be sure to ignore all the chapters after number two.  They're dreadfully out of date.  Rest assured that when our new awesome is finally ready, it'll be completely up to date.</p>
