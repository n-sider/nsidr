<p>Just a reminder, if you haven't already, to head on over to the <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/">N-Forums</a> and cast your vote in the <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=2953">Game of the Year 2005</a> thread so we can count <em>your</em> opinion!</p>

<p>If you were previously holding off because you couldn't or didn't want to explain your choices, worry no longer; the requirement is no more &mdash; though of course <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showpost.php?p=74029&postcount=1">all other rules</a> are still in effect.  (Of course, if you want to elucidate, feel free!)</p>

<p>You've got until midnight EST on January 31st to cast your vote for the best and worst of 2005, so get on over there and make your voice heard!</p>
