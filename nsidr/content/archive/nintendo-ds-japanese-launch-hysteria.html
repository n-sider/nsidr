The <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> is set to arrive in Japanese gamer's hands in just a few short hours.  The Crystal White version will be the only color available with projections of only 91,000 units shipped thus far.  Due to production issues, both Enamel Navy and Ice Blue will be delayed a week until March 11.<br><br>
  
Several stores have reported that based on their lines alone, the Nintendo DS Lite is already sold out.  Due to strong demand, several online retailers such as NCSX have temporarily marked up the normal $140 price of the Nintendo DS Lite to $300 or more.  Nintendo has stated on its website that around 200,000 regular Nintendo DS units and 450,000 new Nintendo DS Lite units will be produced in the month of March.  Nintendo had originally hoped to ship one million Nintendo DS varieties in total during the month.  Images below are via Famitsu showcasing some of the long lines for the hardware's launch.<br><br>
