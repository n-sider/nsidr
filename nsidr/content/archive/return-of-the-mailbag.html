<p>We are aiming to bring the Q&A mailbag back to life in the near future. Problem is it's pretty difficult to do that unless we get some primo letters coming in.

<p>To be clear, the mailbag isn't just for asking questions. We welcome criticism, commentary, feedback, praise, discussion, and even a bit of comedy here and there. General feedback about an article on the site (or even other sites) is also welcome. We'd like to mainly stick to Nintendo discussion, but we're also the first to admit that an excellent game is an excellent game, regardless of the console or platform it appears on. With that in mind, blind fanboy rants probably won't be published often, unless they have some intelligent thought behind them.

<p>Since, by now, you must be overflowing with joy at the mere idea that we might publish your letter, here's how to reach us.

<p><b>Steps to Becoming a Star:</b>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Think of something intelligent to say.
<li>Step 2: Open your email and compose a new letter.
<li>Step 3: Type down that intelligent thought (include a witty header).
<li>Step 4: Read over letter to check grammar, spelling, and level of stupidity.
<li>Step 5: Address letter to <a href="mailto:qa@n-sider.com">qa@n-sider.com</a>.
<li>Final Step: Hit the Send button.
  </ul>

<p>And that's all there is to it. If all goes well I'll be able to start updating the column on a quazi-regular basis. For those that only read the first and last sentences of news posts, again send all letters to <a href="mailto:qa@n-sider.com">qa@n-sider.com</a>.
