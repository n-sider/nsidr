The final version of the Wii Internet Channel is now available for download.  As previously noted by Nintendo, the final version adds the following features over the previously-available trial version:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>improved zooming and scrolling</li>
  <li>an improved zoomed font</li>
  <li>shortened startup times</li>
  <li>quicker access to "favorites"</li>
  <li>an ability to hide the toolbar</li>
  <li>buttons that will instantly type common preset letters, such as "www" or ".com"</li>
  </ul><br />
Also of import is the Internet Channel's new search button, which will submit your search directly to your choice of Google or Yahoo!  The Internet Channel is available, after a system update, from the Wii Shop Channel for free.  Nintendo intends to charge 500 Wii Points for the download after June has passed, so get it for free while you can.
