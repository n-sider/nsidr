<p>IGN's Revolution channel has <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/682/682470p1.html">an interview with NubyTech president Paul Chen</a> discussing NubyTech's plans for building accessories for Revolution.</p>

<p>Chen's goal for NubyTech is, as he sees it, different from the other third party accessory manufacturers: he doesn't plan to simply make value-priced versions of official Nintendo accessories.  Chen would like to create "products that are licensed by Nintendo, work within the Revolution, but also complement the experience. Different, but still working within the Revolution."</p>

<p>It also seems that right now, Nintendo may not be opening up the main controller itself to third parties, but rather encouraging them to direct their efforts toward plug-in accessories.  Chen hopes Nintendo will allow them access to the core technology in the "remote" controller, but Nintendo has not yet made their intentions clear.</p>

<p>Also of note is reconfirmation that Nintendo plans to release Revolution around the Thanksgiving timeframe, and that NubyTech definitely has plans for the Revolution's unique brand of backwards compatibility &mdash; so perhaps we can expect to see some interesting retro gaming solutions from them.</p>
