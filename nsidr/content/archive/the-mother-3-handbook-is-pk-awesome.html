Anyone who followed the <a href="http://mother3.fobby.net/">fan translation</a> of <i>Mother 3</i>, which was released last October (and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=4174&view=review">reviewed</a> by yours truly shortly thereafter) likely recalls the <a href="http://handbook.fangamer.com/">Mother 3 Handbook</a> project, an effort to create a full-color, official-looking strategy guide for the English version of the game.  I am happy to report that after nearly six months, the books are printed and shipping out!  My copy came yesterday, complete with the specially-made pewter Courage Badge keychain and a reversible dust-jacket.<br />

Visually this thing's a stunner.  The website states that "thousands" of hours were spent writing, editing, and arranging the 240-page book, which I don't doubt in the least.  They even built over 50 clay models to photograph for the book (shrewdly emulating the style of the original <i>Earthbound</i>'s instruction manual/strategy guide).<br />
<br />
Every ounce of this thing oozes polish and care.  It unquestionably surpasses even most official guides I've seen (and I've seen a fair number of them).  I'd recommend checking out some sample pages or just picking one up over at <a href="http://fangamer.net/products/m3-handbook">Fangamer</a> (you could do a lot worse with twenty bucks).  Continue reading for a few more pictures of the book and its dual-sided dust-jacket.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />

Thanks to the people at Fangamer for following this whole project through to the end!
