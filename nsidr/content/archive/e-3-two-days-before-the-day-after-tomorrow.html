With just two days to go until the first press conference begins, web sites and forums all around the internet are exploding with <a href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1865624">rumours</a>, <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=3185">wild speculation</a>, and just <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=98622">all around craziness</a>. </p>
<p>In today's look back, we're going to tap into one of our pre-e3 articles from 2004, &quot;<a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/the-pre-e3-storm">The Pre-E3 Storm</a>&quot; </p>

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>The Pre-E3 Storm is well and truly in high gear with less than two  weeks to go until the big event. The current hot topics concerning  Nintendo that are floating around the Internet are of companies flying  the coop, long-awaited games coming out of thin air, Nintendos next  pieces of hardware, and a whole host of new Nintendo games.</p>
      <p>Now then, starting with all those developer relations that have  recently hit the fan, we first had Factor 5 announcing that theyre  developing for Sony and Microsoft in addition to Nintendo, and then we  got news of a split between Nintendo and second party Silicon Knights,  and finally that small tidbit that got released about the possibility  of Nintendo working with Kuju on an as-yet un-named game. </p>
      <p>Its all very exciting and you can bet that at E3, N-Sider will  badger and annoy any individual from each respective company to get as  many juicy pieces of information as possible to you readers. We promise  well get to the bottom of each story, find out the games (if any) in  development, and well try and glean any information we can about each  companys future aspirations. There have been conspiracy theories on our  forums about the truthfulness of the Silicon Knights announcement, and  you can bet that well do our damnedest to find out once and for all if  that Silicon Knights rumour is indeed true.</p>
    <p>For two years, weve been looking forward to the game being developed  by a team of ex-Rare employees who worked on the legendary Goldeneye  007 and Perfect Dark on the Nintendo 64. We heard that they were  working closely with Nintendo, and we thought it would be a GameCube  exclusive, but we were in for a shock. That team is Zoonami and most of  us logically expected an enormous FPS in the same mould as the two N64  classics. Instead Zoonami shocked us with the recent announcement that  it is working on a multiplayer rhythm-action title called <em>Funkydilla</em> and that it would be developed for multiple consoles.  E3 will hopefully reveal more to us.</p></td>
