<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3352-1.jpg" width="173" height="92" class="image_styled" /></div>Starting tomorrow, July 10th, N-Sider will officially begin its coverage of E3.  In previous years we've provided up-to-date news followed by a flurry of post-show game features.  This year, however, we're completing a radiant triumvirate with the inclusion of our E3 Liveblog.<br />
<br />
Sitting at the top of our homepage, the Liveblog will be an automatically-updating outlet for immediate E3 coverage.  Most notably, it will be used for play-by-play coverage of Nintendo's preshow event.  Instead of having to wait for other outlets to write up their coverage, you can catch what's going on as it breaks.  The Liveblog will update itself automatically as we feed it our coverage, so there's no need for you to refresh the page!  Just sit back and watch the updates come streaming in.<br />
<br />
Not only will there be constant text-based coverage of the show, but we've managed to wire the Liveblog to our camera phones, which means screenshots of any new games will appear on the site seconds after they're first revealed.<br />
<br />
But wait, there's more!  Nintendo's preshow doesn't start until Wednesday, so we'll also be bringing you live coverage of the Sony and Microsoft preshow events.  Tell your friends!  It never hurts to get a look at the competition.<br />
<br />
The three preshow events are scheduled for the following times:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft: July 10, 7:30pm - 9:00pm</li>
  <li>Nintendo: July 11, 8:30am - 10:15am</li>
  <li>Sony: July 11, 11:30am - 1:15pm</li>
  </ul><br />
E3 is in Santa Monica this year, so all times are PST.<br />
<br />
N-Sider's E3 Liveblog will remain active for the whole week, so we can continue to feed you all manner of photos and little details not fit for actual fully-fledged news stories.  Be sure to check back often, and look forward to our more in-depth game coverage later this month.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the show!
