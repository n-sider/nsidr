<p>Nintendo Japan has opened the Japanese website for the Nintendo DS cinematic adventure game called <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/anoj/index.html">Another Code</a>.  The game makes innovative use of the two-screens on the Nintendo DS, with player actions being controlled on the bottom screen while a view 'through the eyes of the character' is shown on the top screen.  The title is scheduled to release February 24 in Japan and if Nintendo of America decides to release it here, <i>Another Code</i> will be a title to keep an eye on.  Be sure to visit the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/anoj/index.html">site</a> to view a trailer of the game.</p>
