<p>UK retailer Index has dropped the selling price of the Nintendo GameCube to 39.99 (about $73 USD).  Index's website has been cleared of GameCube stock and the price is now only available in stores.  Nintendo has commented that it thinks Index will continue to stock and offer GameCube consoles for sale.</p>
