As this year's Australian Open draws to a close, Nintendo Australia has announced that one lucky radio listener will be able to participate in an all-star WiiSports tennis match on the final day of the tournament (Sunday, 27th of January).<br />
<br />
The promotion involves Mix 106.5's morning presenters, Sonia Kruger and Todd McKenny.  The winner of the competition will be competing against both of the radio personalities as well as tennis ace Mark<br />
Philippoussis himself on the day.<br />
<br />
The match will commence at 5:15pm and will be broadcast on the big screen in Garden Square, near the Rod Laver Arena.<br />
<br />
Nintendo is the "official console supplier" of this year's Australian Open,  occupying its own tent, where the ongoing Wii Championships have been held.  Winners have received prizes as well as the opportunity to duke it out on the big screen in front of the crowds.
