<i>We're counting down to the Wii's launch with a daily look at what retro games we'd like to see on the Virtual Console.  Each also features a Virtual Console Likelihood rating.  A rating of 5 means the game has officially been announced for the service.

I've grown up with the Ninja Turtles.  They've been there for me whenever I'm down, cheering me up with pizza and tales of adventure in Dimension X.  I miss Turtles In Time, mostly because it's the best Turtles game of all.  The TMNT are trapped in a time warp devised by the evil Shredder, and must travel to different periods defeating their enemies in order to get home to the 1990s.<br />
<br />
Two player mode was the best, because there's nothing like fighting the Foot Clan with a buddy.  The Turtles each have their own weapons, obviously, and they get special attacks and power-ups from eating pizza they find on the ground along the way.  Eating pizza I find on the ground makes me feel invincible too.  It's funny how games and real life mimic each other sometimes...<br />

This game would be a blast to have on Virtual Console, because it's one of the last great 2D beat-'em-up games ever.  In 3D they're all "action platformers" like Enter The Matrix and, well, the newer TMNT games.  Now if you'll excuse me, I feel like some pizza before I write about Duck Hunt.<br />

Normally, there would be a 100% chance that Duck Hunt gets onto Virtual Console.  The reason it might not is because Nintendo has made an updated version as part of the Wii Play compilation disk.  Now two players will be able to play, and targets include not only ducks, but UFOs and floating bullseyes.  It looks like a lot of fun.  Maybe we'll even be able to shoot the dog!<br />
<br />
Duck Hunt was one of those games where any time you get bored, you can always pick it up for a few minutes to kill some time.  There's no epic quest, no multiple endings, and no online mode.  It's just you, a gun, and some ducks - the way nature intended.  The game doesn't even have a real ending at all.  When you hit level 99 and beat it, you reach level 00, and ducks just stop appearing, although their sound continues.  These levels count as if you failed, and so the game ends after the dog laughs at you 10 times.  Pretty anti-climactic, but it's not the ending that matters, it's the journey!<br />

Duck Hunt also includes Clay Shooting, where clay pigeons are fired into the distance and you must pick them off before they get too far away.  It's a bit harder, and there's no dog to laugh at you if you fail.  After a few hours of playing, I almost miss the little guy.  Then I remember how useless that dog always is, and I go back for some more ducks.  This is why the game really shouldn't be played for multiple hours - you start getting crazy...
