Naruto is coming to the DS again with <i>Naruto: Path of the Ninja</i> (tentative title), the first Naruto RPG to hit the U.S., based on the popular anime series. Choosing from one of six different characters, players will use the time-based combat system to fight through, and explore, the Village Hidden in the Leaves and other sites from the show. The game is based on the Japanese game <i>Naruto RPG 2: Chidori vs Rasengan</i>.<br />
<br />
The game is being developed by TOMY Corporation and D3Publisher of America, which has handled Naruto game releases as of late in the United States. Naruto: Path of the Ninja is anticipated to release this fall.
