GameSpot is reporting that Capcom's developer subsidiary, Flagship, will <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6171114.html">lose its distinctive name</a> and that Flagship employees will continue to work at Capcom as they always did.<br />
<br />
It was reported earlier that Flagship would be dissolved, much like Clover Studios was. Capcom's year-end financial report stated that Flagship is set to be merged with Capcom and eventually dissolved, according to GameSpot. However, a Capcom spokesperson later said that all that will change is the company name on their business card&mdash;employees will retain their previous positions within the larger company.<br />
<br />
Flagship is well-known for developing the post-<i>Link's-Awakening</i> Zelda entries on Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, as well as <i>Kirby & the Amazing Mirror</i> and <i>Kirby Squeak Squad</i>.  Whether Flagship developers will remain available for Nintendo to offload projects onto remains to be seen. <i>(Contributed by Ibrahim Ouchikh)</i>
