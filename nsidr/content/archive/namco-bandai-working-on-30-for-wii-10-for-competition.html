At a recent press conference, it seems Namco Bandai told the assembled journalists that it is working on 30 titles for Nintendo's Wii&mdash;as <a href="http://www.mozlapunk.net/homepage/?p=1496">translated</a> from German gaming news site GameFront by Moz La Punk.<br />
<br />
Namco Bandai has, over the past few years, shifted its output to include a lot of licensed content, so it's likely that its Wii titles will have a large share of this sort of thing&mdash;especially as Wii is seen to target the family audiences for which licensed content is attractive.<br />
<br />
At the press conference, Namco Bandai also said that it has only 10 titles in the works for Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360.
