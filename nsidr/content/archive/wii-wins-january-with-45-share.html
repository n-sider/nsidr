The January numbers are rolling in, and via Bloomberg.com we have an indication of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601204&sid=aeP6KYaQ4o_k">how Wii is doing</a> versus competition from Microsoft and Sony.<br />
<br />
Wii won January handily, moving 436,000 units compared to Microsoft's Xbox 360 (launched last year) which checked in at 294,000 units and  Sony's PlayStation 3, moving a little over half Wii's numbers with 244,000 units.<br />
<br />
Anecdotal reports suggest Wii continues to be sold out at retail even now, though we really have no way of knowing how widespread the sellouts are.  The situation raises the inevitable question: how well could Wii do if Nintendo was able to supply larger numbers of units?
