New game development studio Nnooo (pronounced "NO!") has announced their intent to bring their original puzzle title <i>Pop</i> to WiiWare.  We have <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6114&view=screens">eight new screens</a> of the work-in-progress, which Nnooo describes thusly:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">The single and multi-player game will give gamers the chance to burst their way through waves of bubbles - grabbing power-ups, multipliers, chains and aiming for worldwide high-scores.<br />
<br />
Pop is designed to be enjoyed by all ages, either in single player or with up to three friends and allows people to steal points from opponents and use the controller to pump up the bubbles for bigger explosions. It is based around a simple concept which anyone can pick and play with layers of skill involved. Core gamers and those new to the Wii, or games in general, will all find it enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The website is up and running at <a href="http://www.pop-game.net/">www.pop-game.net</a> and will continue to have new content added as the game gets closer to release.</div>
