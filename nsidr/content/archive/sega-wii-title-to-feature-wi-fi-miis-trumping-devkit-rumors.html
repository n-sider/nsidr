Sega Sammy has in the works a Fist of the North Star-themed <a href="http://www.sega.co.jp/wii/pphokuto">pachinko collection</a> for Wii, and it features integration with two key features that reports had suggested <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2660">were unavailable to third parties</a>: the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection online service and Mii avatars.<br />
<br />
The title features a handful of Wii-specific features, such as shaking the Remote to operate the pachislot games, and tilting it to control the "steering wheel" which in turn controls the speed of the balls in the pachinko games.  The Wi-Fi Connection will lend support to the title for an online ranking system, where players will be represented by the Miis they select.<br />
<br />
The title will be released on May 24 in Japan.  It's doubtful it will appear in any other territory.
