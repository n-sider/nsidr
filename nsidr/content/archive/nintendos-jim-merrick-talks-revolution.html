Eurogamer.com has conducted an very insightful interview with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick</a> regarding the recently announced Project Revolution controller.  Check out an excerpt below or the full interview <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=60917">here</a>.

<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Eurogamer:</b> How is the controller going to work with games that aren't designed specifically for the Revolution - multi-platform titles and so on?<br>
<br>
<b>Jim Merrick:</b> We're producing a classic-style expansion controller, based on traditional designs like the Gamecube controller. It's like a shell with a hole in the top into which you slot the freehand-style controller, and then you can play third-party ported games, and retro Nintendo games you've downloaded.<br>
<br>
So there's that option - but even while it's inserted into the classic-style shell, the freehand controller will still be able to sense positioning and so on, so there are more options too.<br>
<br>
It's something that's just as true for the DS - not every game uses the DS's unique features. But some multi-platform titles do, like The Sims 2 for example. We hope other developers will do the same and look at ways their multi-platform titles can make use of the Revolution's features.  <br>
<br>....<br><br>
<b>Eurogamer:</b> Is the freehand-style controller your trump card, or have we got more exciting stuff to look forward to? <br>
<br>
<b>Jim Merrick:</b> Let's just say we have more surprises in store.
