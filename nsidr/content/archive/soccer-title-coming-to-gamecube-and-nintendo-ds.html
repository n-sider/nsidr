<p>DC-Studios has partnered with Dino Dini to create a soccer title for multiplatform consoles including the Nintendo DS and GameCube, according to IGN.com.</p>

<blockquote><p><font size="2">"The current generation of football games have no focus on the player," Dini told IGN. "The game itself is the spectacle. This is a problem. It is the player's experience which is the key to creating a game which is accessible, playable and has long term appeal to players. If you can create an experience that satisfies the player each and every time they play the game, then you have created a classic."</font></p></blockquote>

<p>Dini is responsible for creating such NES and SNES games as Super Kick Off, Kick Off 2, and Player Manager, Goal and Dino Dini's Football.</p>
