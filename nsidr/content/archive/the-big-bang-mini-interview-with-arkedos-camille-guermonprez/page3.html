<div class="box">Ah!  So, one other thing that I've wondering since the PR started coming out: how does the "Final Bouquet" work, exactly?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Guermonprez:</span>It's a connect-the-dot thing. We love connect-the-dots. <i>(smiles)</i><br />
<br />
...hey, don't leave!<br />
<br />
Each world has a special rule, though. Some of them are really tricky.<br />
<br />
Basically, this part is just a bonus. After you have completed your level (of course, at this point, the game saves and the next level is unlocked), you connect dots with your stylus, and it reveals a picture if you succeed, just like in <i>Picross</i>. You draw your own Final Bouquet.<br />
<br />
If you manage to have all the pictures right, you unlock an additional mode (the Relax Mode) which is designed for those weird states you are in when you come back from parties... mmm.<br />
<br />
We really tried to put many more unlockables, hidden stuff and silly things in this game. We also made the progression simpler: each levels lasts about 2 to 3 minutes, and is automatically saved when you succeed. Oh, and we tried to design the alarm clock better this time, and also put more music (around 30 tracks) by popular request. <i>(smiles)</i></div></div><br />
<div class="box">One of the things that I've been particularly attracted to (and what convinced me to try Nervous Brickdown in the first place) was the really cool art.  Who's responsible for that?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Guermonprez:</span><div class="align_right"><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6248&view=art&imgid=5"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3811-6.jpg" width="169" height="255" class="image_styled" /></a></div>Always the same guy: Aur√©lien Regard. I'm his biggest fan. <i>(grins)</i><br />
<br />
I hired him 9 years ago now, in my first company.  He now is my partner in Arkedo.  However much I loved <i>NB</i> art, I really think <i>BBM</i> is better, but don't tell him!<br />
<br />
The music guys also are the same: Xavier Thiry and Sylvain Hellio (a.k.a. Yubaba, Smith and Fortune), only older. And this time, as I said, they won an award! They did a great job for <i>BBM</i> and there again, I believe this part is better than <i>NB</i>. We clearly spent more time on this title: we were really afraid to make a so-so game after <i>NB</i> (which was small, but full of love, hope it showed!)  So we compensated by adding layers and layers, I guess.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">Are you guys big DS players outside of your own titles?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Guermonprez:</span>You should see the piles of games in our office :)<br />
Yes we love this little DS. We would not spend 80% of our life on it if we did not... we are lazy, you know.<br />
<br />
But we play many games, on many consoles, and have been doing it for many years. It helps us have a perspective on where we stand, with so many great titles. We come after almost 30 years of games... It teaches respect. <i>(smiles)</i></div></div><br />
<div class="box">Got any favorites?  Have you ever tried my personal GOTY contender, <i>Soul Bubbles</i>?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Guermonprez:</span>Mmm... look in the credits of Soul Bubbles, I guess you may find a clue. <i>(grins)</i></div></div><br />
<div class="box">Haha, I can't believe I missed that.  Right there in the "Special Thanks."</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Guermonprez:</span>Yes, I agree with you, it's a great game. More people should know about this game.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">I've been trying to spread the word.  Anything else you'd like to tell our readers?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Guermonprez:</span>Yes: for our next game, we'll leave our little DS for a while, but we'll stay with Nintendo... *hint*hint*nudge*nudge*</div></div><br />
<div class="box">It was great talking to you. Thanks for answering our questions, and best of luck with <i>Big Bang Mini</i> and in your future endeavors!</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Guermonprez:</span>Thank you!</div></div><br />
<i>Big Bang Mini</i> hits retail this coming January, just in time for you to try to figure out what to do with that stack of gift cards you got under the tree.  (Provided the retailer hasn't gone under, of course.)
