Continuing the active-play style of gaming characterized by <i>Wii Sports</i>, Nintendo announced today at E3 <i>Wii Fit</i>.<br />
<br />
What makes Wii Fit special is the inclusion of the Wii Balance Board (tentative name). The pressure-sensitive board allows for increased interactivity with the games, challenges, and modes of Wii Fit. The Wii Balance Board is sensitive enough to pick up on a person's center of gravity, and whether or not their hips are twirling, useful for a hoop twirling game. The board will also be used for daily testing of a person's BMI, a weight evaluation based on a person's height and weight, and their Wii Fit Age. The Wii Fit Age is determined by a few factors, such as that person's BMI, their center of gravity, and other balance tests.<br />

Aerobics, yoga, muscle stretching, toning, and more will be the focus of the exercising in Wii Fit. The style of exercising with Wii Fit is a "core" workout, emphasizing slower, controlled motions. The title features over 40 types of training activities. These activities fall within one of four types: aerobic exercise, muscle conditioning, yoga poses, and balance games. Aerobic exercises focus on 10-minute exercises for the heart, muscle conditioning relies on controlled movements of body parts, and yoga poses runs through classic poses focusing on balance and stretching. The balance games include a variety of fun activities, like ski jumping and heading soccer balls. Wii Fit also encourages communication, as progress and results can be reviewed between yourself and others on a new channel in the Wii Menu.<br />
<br />
Wii Fit will be coming out in the first half of 2008.
