Xider games, a subsidiary of German publisher bhv Software, has announced two new games headed for Nintendo DS in Europe in the second half of 2007: <i>Ankh: Curse of the Scarab King</i> and <i>Luminator DS</i>.<br />
<br />
Curse of the Scarab King looks to be a new entry in Xider's Ankh series, predated by PC entries <i>Ankh</i> and <i>Ankh: Heart of Osiris</i>.  The game follows protagonist Assil, searching for the Pharaoh to break  a death curse while being pursued by Osiris.  Previous entries in the series have been point-and-click adventures; though Xider doesn't specifically pigeonhole this title, it seems likely the genre would stick to this entry as well.<br />
<br />
Luminator is a music-based puzzle game based on Tetris where players build cubes to the beat of the music.  The title features an endless mode with two difficulty levels and a puzzle mode with 45 puzzles and three difficulty levels.  16 backgrounds and 15 soundtracks will accompany you while you play the game.<br />
<br />
Xider publishes for both PC and Nintendo DS.  Aside from the Ankh series, they've also published Telltale's PC adventure <i>Bone: Out From Boneville</i>.
