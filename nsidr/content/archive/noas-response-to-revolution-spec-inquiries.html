<p>IGN, on their new <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/">Revolution channel</a>, has posted <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/674/674611p1.html">the statement</a> NOA is sending out to folks who write in inquiring about Revolution's rumored technical specifications.</p>

<p>NOA starts off pitching the Revolution's low cost of hardware and development, but they stop short of drawing the conclusion that reduced costs can pave the way for a lot more risk-taking as far as titles go.  Instead, the pitch plays up the possibilities that the controller offers toward gameplay, as well as the retro game service that Nintendo plans to offer with the system.</p>
