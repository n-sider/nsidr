<p>The box art for <cite>Yoshi's Island 2</cite> (which we <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-yoshis-island-2">previewed at E3</a>) has been revealed, and with it a previously-unannounced game feature revealed.</p>

<p>It seems the game will support online play of some sort via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection&mdash;though at this point, nobody's really sure how it will work.  More details should be forthcoming between now and the game's scheduled release on November 13.</p>
