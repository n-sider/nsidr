<p>Wayport, Inc., provider of Wi-Fi to Big Mac types everywhere and now partner with Nintendo providing free Wi-Fi Connection access to Nintendo DS owners gracing the Golden Arches, announced today that "tens of thousands" of gaming connections were offered through its network since the Wi-Fi Connection launched November 14.</p>

<p>Wayport has experienced record-breaking paid customer connections this year: 10 million worldwide across 12,000 locations &mdash; putting the WFC connections at some single-digit percentage of all Wayport connections.  Of those locations, 6,300 are McDonald's restaurants with WFC access inside; the rest are hotels and other locations inside and outside the US.</p>

<p>Also recall that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1624">WFC has seen 10 million unique connections worldwide</a> since its mid-November launch with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a>; "tens of thousands" begins to look like a very small number indeed.</p>
