Nintendo has "unofficially announced" <i>Mario Paint</i> for release in the latter-half of 2006, according to sources from Spong.com. The DS title will reportedly offer a community-based environment (not unlike <i>Nintendogs</i>), allowing other DS and even Revolution owners to share drawings, music, etc.
