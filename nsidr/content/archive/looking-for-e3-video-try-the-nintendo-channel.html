This is really just a heads-up for you readers more than anything, but an hour ago, I was being asked by folks in our chat if there were any good videos they could watch of things they'd missed at the conference&#8212;such as <i>Metroid: Other M</i>&#8212;and the answer was no.  At the time, not even Nintendo's own press site had the videos in question.<br />
<br />
Well, before I closed up for the day, I quickly checked the Nintendo Channel, and lo and behold, there are trailers for everything, from <i>Other M</i> to <i>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</i> and <i>Galaxy 2</i>.  The digest video says these will be up all week, so if you've got a Wii with the Nintendo Channel installed, you're set: just dim the lights, turn up the stereo, and enjoy!
