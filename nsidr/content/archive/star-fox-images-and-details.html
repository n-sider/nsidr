<p>From Nintendo:

<p><i>"Several years after disaster was narrowly averted on Dinosaur Planet, Lylat Central Command detects a new threat spreading throughout the galaxy. The Star Fox team is sent in to eradicate this growing menace, but what begins as a standard combat mission quickly takes a dramatic turn. Legendary team members Fox McCloud, Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare and Falco Lombardi join forces to form the most formidable team in the history of this celebrated series: the Star Fox armada!"</i>
