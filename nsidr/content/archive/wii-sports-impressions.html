<p>In Wii Tennis, we'd like to clear up certain assumptions about movement on the tennis course. First of all, you will need to determine and use the required swing. For example, if the ball coming towards you requires a backhand swing, you will miss it if you don't perform a backhand swing. Meaning, you can't just wildly hit the ball no matter what kind of swing you do. The game fully maps every swing. It even maps whether you follow your swing the whole way through. Another important note is that while there is no 1:1 movement, there are options to move across the court. For example, you can decide to play the backcourt or play the net. I don't recall how this was performed, but I believe by stabbing the Wii remote forward you move your character closer to the net. This is crucial to those thinking there was no court placement strategy in the game because there is.</p>

<p>Wii Baseball kind of plays like Mario Baseball. It isn't just a homerun derby. You can get singles and put a man on base. Then you have the opportunity to bring the man home by scoring another hit. You keep offense until you get three outs. Then you switch. Nintendo also added the ability to pitch against your opponent, making it a two-sided affair now. You can throw a screw ball, fast ball, and curve ball. And it isn't as easy to hit a homerun as past videos have shown.</p>

<p>Wii Boxing is the only Wii Sports game to use the Wiimote and the Nunchuk. While you don't move your character, you control the blocks and evades while you also control your left/right strikes. Jabs, hooks, and uppercuts are all mapped out accurately. The game is definitely a throwback to Punch-Out under the Wii Sports banner. This one is sure to be a huge hit.</p>

<p>The entire WiiSports line-up has an interesting presentation style almost mimicking an ESPN telecast. Replays and constant Wii Sports banners are shown during gameplay.  Wii Sports also has some amazing textures -- real-time shadowing and nice reflections. The textures are what really makes this game graphically next-gen. Finally, in regards to gameplay, there is much mystery as to how deep and well presented a full single player session will be.  Stay tuned for more details.</p>
