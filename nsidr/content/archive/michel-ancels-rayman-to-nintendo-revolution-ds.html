<p><a href="http://www.ubi.com/US/">Ubisoft</a> will release a new title in the Rayman platforming series for current and next-generation home consoles including <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Nintendo Revolution</a> and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>.  The title is in development at Ubisoft's Montpellier studio, home of designer Michel Ancel who has been responsible for such acclaimed titles as <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=670">Beyond Good & Evil</a> and Peter Jackson's King Kong. The untitled game is scheduled for a 2006 holiday release.</p>

<p>This is the fourth game in the <a href="http://www.rayman-fanpage.de/history/storye.htm">Rayman series</a> designed by Ancel.  The franchise has reached sales of over 16 million units worldwide since the character's introduction in 1995 for the Sony PlayStation.  The third title in the series and most recent release was seen in 2003 for multiple systems and named Rayman Hoodlum Havoc.</p>

<p>"Rayman is one of the brands that encapsulate Ubisoft's ability to create characters and universes that appeal to all kinds of players," said Ubisoft CEO, Yves Guillemot. "We are expecting this new Rayman video game to sweep players off their feet."</p>
