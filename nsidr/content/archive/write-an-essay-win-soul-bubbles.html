<b>Update:</b>  The contest is now closed.  Thanks for your entries.  We'll publish the winning essay shortly!<br />
<br />
I <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/a-highly-productive-shopping-trip">mentioned a few days ago</a> that I was really digging <i>Soul Bubbles</i>, and I'm here to tell you today that said digging is unabated&#8212;if anything, I'm enjoying myself <i>more</i>.  It's becoming clear to me that <i>Soul Bubbles</i> is one of <i>those</i> games: lovingly crafted by a team dedicated to their art, masterfully designed, and evoking joy at every turn.<br />
<br />
I decided I simply could not keep this joy to myself, so I went down the other day and picked up another brand-new, shrink-wrapped copy&#8212;that's right, with my own money, no PR agencies involved&#8212;with the intent of giving it away.  I want to spread the joy.  But you'll have to do a little something to prove your worth.<br />

To enter the N-Sider Soul Bubbles Giveaway Contest, I need from you an essay about the sweetest game you ever played that tanked at retail.  ("Tanked" is a subjective term, of course, but I'm sure you all realize you can't apply it to <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>.)  Our crack prose judging team here at N-Sider (me and whoever else I can convince to read a few words) will choose the best, send the winner the game, and publish it alongside any more that tickle our fancies.  (Sorry, no runner-up prizes, other than your name in lights here at n-sider.com.)<br />
<br />
You must be a U.S. resident and not current or former staff of N-Sider Media to win the prize, though you can certainly still send your essay if you don't meet these criteria&#8212;you just won't win anything.  Send your essay along with your full name and mailing address to <a href="mailto:mattb@n-sider.com">mattb@n-sider.com</a> before <b>Monday, November 3</b>.  We'll undertake the judging soon after that and you can expect to read the winners' entries sometime later that month.<br />
<br />
Happy writing!
