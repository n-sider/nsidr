<h3>GameCube on a computer monitor: a response</h3>
<p> [This question is a direct response to the letter titled GameCube on a computer monitor in the <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/columnview.php?columnid=140> 12-03-2005 mailbag</a>.]

<h3>What is Nintendo hiding?</h3>
<p>The remaining secret-what is it all about?I think it might not be  too hard to guess.If it was related to the controller the only thing that comes to mind as a logical or plausible addition would be the rumour which made the rounds about it being somehow resistant to being tilted.If they got something else up their sleeves related to the controller then I really don't have a clue what it could be.Any ideas?And since they showed the functions of it,why would they hold back any information if the secret really was related to the controller?I read somewhere that the remaining secret could be the ability to hide behind real world objects,a rumour that derived from the TGS trailer where a person hides behind an armchair in a game which seemed to mirror a fps.This sounds a little fanciful to me and you ought to take it with a grain of salt.Irrespective,the recent GamesIndustry.biz article quotes a developer who seems to be partly initiated about Nintendo Revolution.He makes a very interesting comment about the GPU which leads me to believe that the remaining secret should have something to do with it."A bit of a black box" and "..nobody's seen the hardware yet" are the lines that really caught my attention and made me think about it.Does anybody commemorate Outcast for PC?It was released in 1999 and used a different rendering method called Volumetric Pixels or short voxels rather than polygons,allowing for a larger,busier world to be rendered without top hardware!The use of a different rendering technique would match the statements of the developer about the GPU,the general philosophy of Nintendo and the implausibility of the secret being related to the controller quite to the point if you ask me.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Its truly impossible to say at this point. In subsequent letters, you sent me speculative pieces on things like parallax mapping, displacement mapping, and cube mapping. Im sure these types of graphical techniques will be used here and there in the years to come, but they are hardly something worthy of mention by Nintendo? How is Nintendo going to explain parallax mapping to the public as the remaining secret of the Revolution? These things are far too complicated, emphasize graphics over gameplay/control, and are transparent to the average gamer or non-gamer. 

<p>If there is a secret left in the Revolution it will be something easy to explain and justify. Perhaps the controller will have a built in microphone. In any case, well find out in the next few months.

<h3>N-Sider news stories out of control?</h3>
<p><a href=https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1577>https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1577</a>

<p>Thanks for the "enlightenment," but it goes a little overboard. The
argument of graphics versus gameplay is getting really tiresome,
especially when Nintendo apologists use it in defense of the company's
strategies. The gameing-age poster's colorfully worded contentions
were mostly valid, but were undercut by his too far one-sided lean. In
response, I offer balance.

<p>When you see the first examples of games from a new generation of home
consoles, or even just examples of any new game, the key factor is that you *see* it first. We can't experience gameplay from afar. For
that we actually have to hold a controller and try it out. That's why
graphics are important for a new generation -- graphics our *visual*
cue to advancement of technology that promises improved experiences.

<p>Aside from that, improved visuals also mean a potentially more
immersive experience. Even if a game isn't designed to fool the player
into believing they're experiencing some other facet of reality,
improved visual capability means that artistic game designers have
more resources at their disposal to better realize their concepts,
regardless of nature. Simulation of the real world, emulation of a
cartoon reality, surrealism, impressionism and any other imaginable
visual style are all better served by more powerful graphics
processors.

<p>How do we play games? Do we play them by listening? Not very often, I
only know of one example. And of course, there's that recently famous
deaf kid who can allegedly beat the best of opponents in fighting
games on sound alone. Are we cued to press buttons based on a smell?
How often do you respond to a game based on touch? The fact of the
matter is that games are *video* games, meaning visual -- we have to
play based on what we *see*.

<p>The word "video" comes from the Latin "vide" as the present tense of
"vidre" meaning "to see". One can infer, then, that "video" games are,
by definition, inherently bound to one's ability to percieve them
visually. Based on that, it is not unreasonable to anticipate an
improved experience based solely visual interpretation.

<p>Graphics don't make the game, but they are the video.

<p>I love you,

<p>- Garsh

<p><b>Travis: </b>I would not hesitate to say graphics are important.  The article you linked to actually admits that they are important.  Theyre just not <i>more</i> important than gameplay.  Pitfall is still fun in this day and age and it now looks terrible.  Superman 64 looks incredible by comparison, and it is not fun because it plays terribly.  Thats what it boils down too in the end.

<p>Graphics are of some importance.  We dont want a game to look terrible and a new expensive system with graphics that havent improved at all would be awful simply because wed be wondering why their new ideas didnt come to light in the form of an expansion to their previous system.  But Nintendos not going to have horrible graphics this next gen.  I wholeheartedly believe they will be comparable to the 360 and PS3; maybe not as good, but certainly not far off.  If anything itll be like the PS2 in comparison to the Cube and Xbox.  That system outsold both and some of its games look downright terrible.  From that fact alone we know that graphics arent as important as gameplay.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Well, it may be more like comparing the Dreamcast to GameCube. But either way, things will still look a lot better than they do right now, so I fail to get too horribly worked up over it. 

<p>The only thing that bothers me about the gaming-age post (beside reading it totally out of context) is that he says publishers keep making more and more money by beefing up graphics instead of gameplay. This isnt really true. To make a next generation game for the Xbox 360 or PS3, developers and publishers are going to have to spend 2  4+ times as much as they do today. In a way the industrys own adherence to the visual standard will end up hurting its bottom line.

<p>The thing Nintendo has to do is focus on the experience of playing Revolution games more than the visual games themselves, when it first markets the system. It did this well at the Tokyo Game Show when it unveiled the controller, which is promising. Mind you, this is strictly my opinion.

<h3>Save files</h3>
<p>Hey N-sider,
<p>I've debated this issue among friends, but I am looking for all of
your opinions on how save files should work.  It seem as though every
single Nintendo-developed adventure game only allows for three save
files that are actually in one file on the memory card.  i.e. Metroid
Prime, Wind Waker, etc.  And it also seem that each Nintendo-published
game has a press start screen.  Though none of these things have any
impact on gameplay, the save file issue raises an interesting point:
why?  I can understand that cartridge limitation probably meant a
limited amount of savefiles, but now that we're all disc and memory
card based, why does Nintendo seem to enforce this odd save file
structure?  Eternal darkness is the only exception I can think of.

<p>I'm the guy who said Resident Evil 4 was my favorite game of all time,
and one reason is it's flawless presentation.  It's save system is
actually really nice, in that it has a central system file, and up to
twenty individual save files, in that you can browse them in the
GameCube's gui.   That means it can have a lot of extra modes like
Mercenaries and Assignment Ada work flawlessly and invisibly.  And it
also means that unlike the REmake, you don't have to load a clearfile
to get access to extra modes or a different title screen.

<p>Metroid Prime's menus are probably my favorite from Nintendo-published
games, but I think RE4 outdoes them simply because they are fully
interactive (the zooming and panning of the alternate title screen,
and that the opening corporate logos are very cool, but you can even
make them go quickly if you press the start button.  And it never says
press start.  Also, why do some games let you press A to proceed from
the title screen?  ahem, Metroid Prime.

<p>I realize this is just nitpicking, but I love to see the work done in
presenting games outside of actual gameplay.  RE4 takes the cake time
and time again.

</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>I have to admit I think youre a little insane.  However, I much enjoy talking to the insane so lets have at it.

<p>Your thoughts on save files are just.  I believe Nintendo has continued with the traditional three save files for game for simplicity reasons.  I am fond of seeing my entire save files on screen right away when I boot up Wind Waker or Super Mario Sunshine.  Its better than how some games have it, where you get your title screen and you dont see any files until you select Load from the menu and then you are trying to remember which file is yours.  I like Nintendos way better.  I do agree, however, that you should not be limited in the amount of saves you can make.  They do need an option to have more files.  I know that my girlfriend and I are going to have some slight trouble with Twilight Princess when it releases if it only has the traditional three save files.  This will be our first Nintendo game we actually share (since we no longer live on opposite ends of the country and are around each other all the time) and so well both get a file to play through.  Then the third file is what will be tricky.  What is there is a second quest (ala The Wind Waker) and we both want to do it?  Or what if we want to leave our two beaten game files but play through again?  Well be unable to do so with any ease.

<p>As for when some games let you press A in addition to Start to access the title screenwell no two programmers are the same.  It is common to let people press A because it is the primary action button on the controller and many company policies probably include documentation stating that the primary button on the controller should be used quite often.  I know for a fact some companies do have such policies.  As a result, even when the button is used primarily during gameplay you might get someone that programs it to be used during the title screen just so they can be safe.  Additionally, a programmer who is a completely different individual may see no need for it and only allow progress to the title screen when you press start.

<p>That is probably the most thorough answer you will ever get on such an insane subject, good sir.  Youd better appreciate it!

<p>I do agree, though, largely with your opinion that game presentation needs to extend beyond actual gameplay and into the games menus.  However, I disagree that RE4 does such a good job in that regard.  If anything its menus are plain.  They are highly functional, true, but all of Nintendos first party games blow it out of the water.  My official favorite menu this generation belongs to Super Mario Sunshine.  Maybe Im easily amused, but I had fun jumping around the menu alone.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Ive been underwhelmed by the static nature of some of Nintendos games this generation. Mario Kart: Double Dash just has a static screen. I guess Ive come to expect opening movies and some flair from the get go. If I had to choose, Id say that Perfect Dark (N64) and Metroid Prime had some of the best menus I can recollect.

<p>But anyway, I have a problem with Resident Evil 4. I have found no in-game method of deleting save files. You have to delete them through the gui. When I started I didnt realize that each save file took up 8 or so blocks of memory on my card.I made a ton of saves (you can have up to 20 or so). When I found out my Memory Card 256 was full of RE4 files, I decided to go back and delete some. To delete them I have to go back and forth between the game and the GameCube Memory Card Manager deleting the files that feature the save number of the files I wish to delete. Its pretty cumbersome and ridiculous for a game of RE4s caliber.

<h3>Game Boy Evolution E3 announcement?</h3>
<p>Hello, I just wanted to bring up a seemingly forgotten point about
Nintendo's philosophy as of earlier this year. We all heard the mumbo jumbo
about the third pillar philosophy, with rumors of GameBoy Evolution abound,
and now the gameboy advance has virtually no releases schedueled for Q2
2006, along with GameCube releases dismally short except for the new Zelda.
So is Nintendo depending on the DS to hold us over until the release of the
Revolution? Remember, they've only promised playable demos as late as E3
2006, and a release seems most likely in Q4 2006. This transition period
seems like it begs for a new announcement, possibly at E3 as well, and I'm
predicting the unveiling of the next GameBoy installment. They've always
claimed that the DS was never meant to be a true successor to the
GBA/Micro/SP, but it seems like developers are just looking to continue
their series with minimal adaptations to the touch screen and other distinct
features of the DS. This raises the question though, can the DS, GBE and
Revolution all be supported by Nintendo, and if they can, would Nintendo
fans even be willing to support it with those added costs? Thanks for
answering,

<p>- Canadian Psycho
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Nintendo claimed the DS was not a successor to the Game Boy Advance because it didnt want millions of parents to stop buying GBAsand they <a href=https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1587>havent</a>. Right now the GBA is outselling both the PSP and DS. Why? Because its cheap and parents can use it to shut their kids up for a while. Im still excited about Mother 3 (Earthbound 2) for the GBA. I believe thats currently slated for a March 2006 Japanese debut, but I may be mistaken. Youre going to see the GBA slowly begin to fade out and the DS take over. Its inevitable. The DS is the next Game Boy at this point. Perhaps they will call the DSs successor the Game Boy Evolution. 

<p>E3 will not be about the Game Boy Evolution unless Nintendo is dumb. It will be all about the DS and the Revolution. Both are products that compliment each other very well and emphasize similar design philosophies. The company has a lot to prove with the Revolution and it will have to come out all guns blazing. I look forward to the show.

<h3>Game Boy Player price drop? DS Player?</h3>
<p>There's probably no way you guys can reasonably answer these, but I
don't know of anyone better to ask.

<p>Is there any chance the Gameboy Player will come down in price in the
forseeable future (after Christmas, maybe)? Or should I go ahead, cave
in and buy all the GBA games I've been missing? It's only $50 now (has
been for a long time), but I want to pay $30.

<p>Extra stupid question: do you anticipate any potential for a similar
adapter for DS (DS "Player")? Yeah, I can't see how that would even be
possible. Maybe on Revolution, though... The remote might be able to
stand in as a stylus, but then both screens would have to be kind of
squashed in and there would be a lot of empty space on the sides.

<p>- Garsh
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>I dont foresee the Game Boy Player ever going down in price officially.  It may go on sale at specific retailers, but the item is a peripheral to the system.  Think of it like a controller.  Those things never go down in price either.  Theyre just there if you want them.  Dont take this as a statement as fact, of course.  If Nintendo drops the price of all Game Boy Players next week dont whine to me because I assumed they wouldnt.

<p>I do not foresee a DS player as ever happening.  Ever.  It would be possible, somewhat, on the Revolution, but Id expect a player for the next Game Boy (still unannounced) before I would the DS.  Its really its own system and is best played with its own equipment.  I do not believe the games would benefit much from being on a TV screen and Im willing to bet Nintendo feels exactly the same way.

<p><b>Jeff: </b>Garsh, you sure like sending us letters. This is your second one! The Game Boy Player hasnt gone down in price since it debuted, so I dont expect any price cuts soon. If Nintendo is smart, the Revolution will be able to download Game Boy Advance and Game Boy games like any other console games. That would be awesome. We all know that Tetris DX for the Game Boy Color is the best version out there. End of story.

<h3>Smaller than meets the eye.</h3>
<p>I was just curious as to why the size of the Revoluiton itself is so large.  It almost seems to be the same size as the Xbox 360.  Due to the lack of hardware that it is packing inside, I would have thought that the size of the unit would be much smaller.  Just looking at the recently slimmed down PS2 and the fact that the Revolution will only be about twice as powerful makes me wonder why it is so large.

<p>- Kevin
</div><br>

<p><b>Travis: </b>I think you have been misinformed.  The Revolution system really is quite small.  Ive seen it with my own eyes and I couldnt believe how tiny it was for a home system.  Perhaps you have been looking at a picture of it and assuming it was much larger?

<p><b>Jeff: </b>The blue slot in the system is the size of a regular CD/DVD my friend. If you were to stack three DVD cases on flat top of one another youd have a good estimate of its total size. Its about half the height of a GameCube, a bit wider, but not much deeper. Its tiny.

<h3>Letter of the Week: Should game coverage be for sale?</h3>
<p>I'm sure you are all aware of the fact that Shoe from EGM wrote an
editorial in the most recent issue stating that he has learned that
two magazines and one website's game coverage can be bought with
advertising dollars.  What's N-sider's take on this?

<p><b><a href=http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/16/1546244&from=rss>[Click here to read the editorial]</a></b>

<p>- Joe Trotter
</div><br>

<p><b>Jeff: </b> I dont doubt for a second that hes right. Ive seen and experienced it before. Its probably even worse over the internet. Some sites will over hype games and give feature spots and coverage to certain titles simply because of that kind of corporate attitude. Id like to hope that most of them draw the line at reviews, but when the line is that thin, its hard to say. Video game journalism certainly has a long way to go before its anywhere close to where it needs to be. 

<p>And on the subject of respect, EGM isnt really in a place to criticize others. It isnt a great magazine (not that theres much competition). So while they may think theyre on a high horse, Ive read a lot of crap in Electronic Gaming Monthly and it needs a better layout. So yeah, take that EGM. 

<p>While I cant say that my direct attack on EGM was any better than Editor-in-Chief Dan Shoe Hsus generic attack on all competitors, Im sure both served an equally negative purpose. 

<p>To answer your question though, N-Sider has not, does not, and will never succumb to the corporate mentality that permeates from some sites. As it stands, we have never even had any form of advertising on the site. I cant say if that will ever change, but we firmly believe that the integrity and vision of the site must come before any plot to attain a profit. N-Sider is here because there are a group of people who truly believe in what it stands for and because of our awesome community. Thats you guys. Things will get much better in the years to come, and we arent going to sell our souls to do it.
