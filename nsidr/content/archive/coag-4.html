<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/coag4_1.jpg" width="200" height="267" align="left">Greetings
once again earthlings, I am emperor Dean and it's time once again for <i>Confusions
of a Gamer</i> *cue the scary music and cheesy special effects*. I'm going to get
straight to the point today instead of dillydallying about with useless
information. Today's article is about video-game advertising, ranging from way
back in the NES days to today with movie-like PS2/Xbox/GCN ads. Yeah, I said
Movie-Like GCN ads, there are a few out there. The picture I've headed today's
article with is actually quite appropriate, I'm a walking advertisement for two
consoles. Firstly, the NES with the 'know your roots' and the old controller on
it. And even though it's not visible in the picture, those dog-tags are from E3
and they have SOCOM II on them. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Back in the days of the NES, Nintendo was really the only
company doing gaming advertising. Sure Atari was doing it's respective 'thang'
but since this is a Nintendo website, we focus on Nintendo, alright class? I
think one of the first ads I can remember seeing (and understanding) was the
Super Mario Bros. 3 advertisement, with all the kids wearing different coloured
t-shirts and the camera zoomed out to see that North America was one big Mario
face. It was ads like these that kept Nintendo ahead of Sega (and I'm sure the
Super Mario Bros. Super Show helped as well) and their juggernaut of Sonic
cartoons. Fast forward to the short-lived VirtualBoy advertisements... To
comment on these would be a waste of time, so in the shortest possible way, here
we go: They tried to recreate what 'you saw' in the headset, on a television
screen. Selling a supposed 'console' with half-assed red lines on a TV really
didn't cut it, I think I only saw that commercial <i>once</i> and that was it.
Moving on to the N64, when it launched I rarely saw any ads for games on that
system until the legendary Super Smash Brothers commercial. Not only was it
insanely clever but it made a lot of people buy the game. Up until this point
Nintendo's franchises were all good and fun, living in their fairytale worlds --
but once Super Smash Brothers came along, that was all going to change. Who
would have thought pitting Nintendo's famed franchises together in a fighting
game would <i>ever</i> happen? Well, it did, and it sold well. Well enough to
warrant a sequel on the GameCube and undoubtedly rumours of a third game began
surfacing. Nintendo did good, real good; but is it good enough?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">In terms of N64 advertising, we didn't really get much
more than game play footage and some cheesy taglines that only imprinted
Nintendo's kiddy image further into our brains. Meanwhile, Sony was already
starting their league of extraordinary advertising with their CG-Heavy
commercials and only a smidgen of in-game footage which ultimately fooled enough
gamers to buy Sony's games only to be fooled by the shoddy graphics and jaggy's
galore. This trend continued with Nintendo's lack of third party support, and
the firm belief that it could survive on the success it had with Mario64,
Nintendo turned a blind eye to the changing trends in the advertising market for
games, this was perhaps the final nail in the proverbial coffin.</font> <font face="Arial">At
the end of the N64's life-cycle, Sony announced and launched its' PlayStation2
console -- blown away by greater graphics and even more movie-trailer like
commercials, Nintendo got it's head in the game with various ads for Conker (who
can resist a squirrel having sex and throwing up on National television?) and
Perfect Dark with some ads that tried to emulate Sony's style, but it just
didn't fit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Jump ahead a year or two, the GameCube is just about to be
launched, and the PS2 has been out and thriving in a next-generation market of
it's own; and we finally hear from Nintendo. Not only do we get (in my opinion)
one of the coolest imagery-heavy commercials from them in a long time, it made
me really want a lot of the games being advertised. Originally created to be
played in theatres before movies, Nintendo's first GameCube commercial was very
cool -- The cube in the mall lobby, with the samurais and all that crazy jive
stuff that made everyone go insane... that is, until the PS2 started coming out
with their even <i>more</i> artistic commercials that made absolutely no sense,
but were still cool in their own respect. The PS9 commercial comes to mind, and
the original wXrld commercial was also something of note. Sony had outplayed
Nintendo once again, and the GameCube hadn't even launched yet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Nintendo quickly returned fire with their GameBoy Advance
commercials, taking 'advanced' spins on every day life (Hotel lobby advanced,
airport terminal advanced, and so on). Not only did they advertise their newest
handheld, but they were able to throw in subtle advertisements for their launch
games as well, such as Super Mario Advanced 1 and 2. This was Nintendo's first
real show of being aware in the realm of advertising. They contracted various
directors and institutions to create commercials for their upcoming games; and I
can't fail to mention the success they had with their Eternal Darkness films
project and the interesting, albeit spooky short films that resulted from it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Enter Microsoft. Yeah I know, as if they couldn't get
their hands in every cookie jar, they just had to come up and smash ours. With
their game-play centric approach and attempt at cool imagery, the Xbox quickly made it's
way into movie theatres and onto our Television screens. After being under much
scrutiny for photoshopping their launch game screenshots, Microsoft quickly made
up for that with their advertising campaigns. Halo was Microsoft's killer app,
and they toted it as such -- using the in-game engine for commercials to promote
the game was something unseen of nor attempted before. Nintendo continued with
its' style of advertising until it died out and what we ultimately received was
a monstrosity in the form of the Super Mario Sunshine commercial. I don't know
if the big N was trying to be cool with this, but I really don't want to see game play
footage, then having it paused, then hearing a kid taking a piss in the
background because the game uses a water cannon. That didn't sell the game at
all, and in fact almost turned me off from the entire concept of buying it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Salvation for Nintendo didn't happen until recently, when
Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion were about to be released. They combined
live-action with game play footage in a way where a lot of it you couldn't tell
which was which. The Prime commercial was seen in movie theatres and on
television, and it was seen a lot. Nintendo's partnership with MTV and the then
WWF helped spread word of Prime to teenagers all over North America.
Unfortunately, for Fusion, the same-styled commercial was only seen during Late
Night TV. (Speaking from experience I was only able to see the Fusion commercial
twice while watching Much Music no earlier than Midnight). When Nintendo started
the advertising campaign for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, a commercial
was released into theatres that took the perspective of a girl (his sister)
trapped in the highest tower, and all was good - it was a dark and epic
commercial that hadn't been seen since Ocarina of Time was released, and it was
what Nintendo needed to sell the game; that is until, it showed the actual game play
footage which did not mesh well at all with the mood of the other shots. Wind
waker looked too happy, too bright, much like Super Mario Sunshine looked too
bright -- how could you feel the peril of your sister's kidnapping in a
lite-brite colourful world?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Recently however, Nintendo released its GameBoy Advance SP
with a variety of artistic commercials -- my personal favorite is the forest
with the moths, which flock to the front-light of the SP which then changes in
to the word 'beautiful', and that's the commercial. That's it, straight to the
point and concise. Breaking it down you can see that it's something new, it's
small, and it is front-lit -- everything GBA fans were waiting for was here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With yet another new generation of consoles upon us, and
Nintendo finally getting it's head in the game, what can we expect to see on our
television screens in the near future? Sony is planning its PlayStation
Portable, and Microsoft continues to advertise heavily its Xbox. Nintendo needs
to make a choice, and unfortunately for them, the choice they are likely to make
is the wrong one. As a hearty cry to Nintendo, I think I speak for a lot of us
that Nintendo needs to listen to their fan base, or what's left of it. If they
want to shake their kiddy image which they seem to acknowledge they have, they
need to stop ignoring the fan base they are catering to. Wake up Nintendo, it's
about time you do.</font></p>
