During a recent interview with <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/news20790_interview-video-masachika-kawata.html">Jeux France</a>, Capcom producer Masachika Kawata confirmed additional details on the Wii exclusive <i>Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles</i> and commented on the potential for other Resident Evil games on the console.<br />
<br />
Kawata first reiterated that Umbrella Chronicles will feature co-op play, so that two friends can team-up to blast hordes of hungry zombies.  He also confirmed there are no plans for an online mode.<br />
<br />
When asked, Kawata then explained that the decision was made a long time ago to bring <i>Resident Evil 5</i> to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms.  As a result, Capcom is still contemplating whether or not they can or will port the game to Wii.  He noted that sales of Resident Evil 4 and Umbrella Chronicles will ultimately determine the decision.  In regards to other Resident Evil remakes on Wii, Kawata admitted there is potential however it's not currently on Capcom's agenda because the staff is already quite busy with existing projects.<br />
<br />
Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition is currently available in all territories.  Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles is scheduled for release in North America later this year.
