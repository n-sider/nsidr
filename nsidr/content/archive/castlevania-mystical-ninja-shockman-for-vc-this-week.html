This week's update to Wii's Virtual Console service includes three new titles, about which a consensus has been drawn amongst the <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/">N-Forums</a> chat members this morning: this is a good week for the VC.  The titles are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Castlevania</i> (NES, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>The Legend of the Mystical Ninja</i> (Super NES, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Shockman</i> (TurboGrafx16, 1-2 players, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
As usual, you can get these titles on the Wii Shop Channel starting at 9 a.m. Pacific time.  Wii Points are currently available at the rate of 100 for $1.
