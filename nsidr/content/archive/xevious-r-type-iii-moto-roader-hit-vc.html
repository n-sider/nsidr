Yes, it's that time again (or, at least, close to that time&mdash;our news department fell under the weather yesterday, so we missed this one).  Virtual Console Monday is (has been) upon us, and brings the following three new titles ready for you to blow your Wii Points on:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Xevious</i> (NES, 1-2 players, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>R-Type III: The Third Lightning</i> (Super NES, 1-2 players, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Moto Roader</i> (TurboGrafx16, 1-5 players, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
These titles are available in the Wii Shop Channel right now, so if anything interests you enough to drop a couple Extra Value Meals in US dollars on, by all means, head over there and click the buttons!
