Computer Entertainment Suppliers' Association released a preliminary list of companies that will be attending the "Tokyo Game Show", an event that showcases the coming year's consoles and software.  The event is scheduled for September 16 - 18 in Tokyo, Japan.  Nintendo has not traditionally attended the event and is likewise absent from this year's list.  Last year, Nintendo held a nationwide tour to promote the Nintendo DS in Japan.  It's possible the company will plan a similar, separate event.  The first day of the Tokyo Game Show is open to the press and invited guests only while the second and third days are open to the general public.  The Tokyo Game Show is attended by a wide range of publishers including Microsoft, Sony, Konami, Bandai and Square Enix.
