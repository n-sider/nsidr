<p>Buzzcut.com has posted an interesting story titled "Nintendo Versus Everyone: The Business of Business".  The article takes a look at how the gaming media is sometimes consumed by the system wars and overlooks the actual business of interactive entertainment.</p>

<blockquote><font size="2"><i>
<p>While Sony and Microsoft spent E3 showing off what billions of dollars of investment can do at their press events, Nintendo was demonstrating how minimal investment can generate cash.</p>

<p>That folks, is called smart business.</p> 

<p>Yes, it makes for dull news. And the GBM cant come close to generating the excitement of a PS3 or an Xbox 360. But this is where the fan-fueled press keeps going off the rails. We get excited about big ideas and the glitz and glory that colossal investments can create. But we miss the simple, sober successes of a solid business plan.</p></i>
