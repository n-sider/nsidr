<h3>[02.17] IX - All Together Alone</h3><P>It's been a fantastic, 

three-letter week for Heart Containers, and really, who the hell am I to 

complain?  Nobody, that's who.  After all, it's a one letter improvement 

over last week.  Maybe OH JUST MAYBE I'll get four for the next column.  

And then I'd be the effing big-time like Pee-Wee in his 

not-as-hyphenated-as-this-intro Big Adventure.  Speaking of Adventures, we 

were sort of talking about Kirby's this week.  I'm sorry you missed it.  

I'm not below bullying you into writing letters, you jerks.  I'll take 

your damned lunch money DON'T THINK I WON'T.  I will.  Okay maybe not.  

Here's your letters.  Yeah.</P>

<b>Brandon Owns Your Chickens and says:</b> <P>Not a bad idea, and 

actually the best one I got this week.  It's also about three lines long 

which makes it easy to read.  If I absorbed the Internet I think I'd try 

to focus on a select few sites.  Like the ones in the history that you 

delete so your mom doesn't see them.</P>
<P>You know, <I>those</i>.  I mean, the Irish cooking recipes I look up in 

my own free time are my own damned business, yeah?</P>

<b>Brandon says:</b> <P>Oh man last night I was watching this episode of 

Cowboy Bebop as it sauntered casually across my television that's used 

mainly for Adult Swim, and during this episode Ein was wearing a wig.  I 

was like "that's the cat's pajamas" and also "hey that Ein's the bee's 

knees" and so I traveled to where-ever it is that show takes place and I 

stole him.  No joke!  So I brought him back home and I've been using him 

like a pillow for a few hours now.  He's really soft and nice but he is 

sort of starting to smell a little bit.  For some sort of solution to this 

problem, I turned to my friends Sifl and Olly.  Now Olly's not really the 

brightest guy but he knows this great television salesman named Precious 

Roy.  Precious Roy isn't always the most reliable guy but he hooked me up 

with these T.V. diapers they're called and they've been working 

charmingly.  As it goes, they're microwave safe and are super-absorbent so 

you don't really need to change them for days.  Me and Ein have been 

wearing these same T.V. diapers for a couple weeks now based solely on the 

fact that the space/time rift allowed me to go back to a few weeks ago and 

get Ein again so I could have two Eins.  And let me tell you there's nary 

an odor although I am feeling a bit moist in the land down under.  But 

have you thought about how it's even possible?  The space/time rift you 

propose.  If you ate yourself and created a time/space rift, how could you 

even exist to eat yourself and create the rift?  You raise massive 

questions which can only be answered by the scientific canon on 

timetravel, <a href="http://www.timecube.com" 

target="_blank">timecube.com</a>.  Also the Back to the Future movies, but 

they're less insane.  And contain more Christopher Lloyd.  My Philosophy 

professor reminds me of Doc.  Less insane though.  Oh man a few minutes 

ago I was writing this response to some reader's letter about Kirby eating 

himself but it got deleted so I went back through time using the rift and 

I got it back.  I don't think it's a good idea that there're now two of me 

and three little dogs wearing diapers though.</P>
<P>God, that's some good crack right here.</P>

<center><b> --- Closing Comments ---</b></center><P>So that's the end of 

the column.  I bet you're missing the days when you could cruise on over 

to N-Sider and read several letters from your gaming fellows aren't you?  

I know you are.  So here's the deal and it works like this:</P>
<P>If you just take a moment, right after you're done reading these 

closing comments, and click that link down there, the one that says to 

send me an e-mail, and you type some things in the window that shows up, 

and you click send, then I will print your letter next week.  I am not 

joking.  That's all you have to do.  It's the equivalent of begging.  But 

really, I'm begging FOR you because I want you to have fun.  The more that 

you have fun sending letters, the more fun you'll have when you read the 

column.  It's like a swap meet.  You swap letters for entertainment.  Also 

kind of like STDs.  But they're made out of fun.</P>
<P>So in conclusion, send me anything.  OMG BYE 2 U!!!?!</P></TD>
