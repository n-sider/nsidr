<p>Contrary to what EA says in its press release about Wi-Fi play, which led us to post <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1561">a news story claiming Burnout Legends was WFC-compatible</a>, it appears the game is most likely not compatible with the Nintendo WFC after all, offering only local wireless play.</p>

<p>Several hands-on reports from people who got the game -- though unofficial -- seem to deny that the game has any form of WFC compatibility.  The game seems to be flying way under just about everyone's radar, to the point that there are no reviews or anything official other than EA's original press release available on the game.</p>

<p>But the final nail in the coffin seems to be that boxart for the game is missing the tell-tale Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection logo in the corner of the front cover.  This logo has appeared on both <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a> and <i>Tony Hawk's American Sk8land</i> as well as on the copies of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=873"><i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i></a> that we recieved for our <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/n-sider-goes-wild">N-Sider Goes Wild</a> coverage.  The logo is a sure sign the game will go online via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection; look for it in titles you buy if online is an important feature for you.</p>
