<p><a href="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/3048">GameVideos.com</a>, a new site part of the 1Up network, has posted a video sample excerpt of Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata's</a> March 2006 Game Developer Conference keynote.  After watching the <a href="<a href="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/3048">short clip</a>, feel free to take a look at the full script with added commentary below.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Satoru Iwata - "Disrupting Development"</font><br>
2006 Game Developers Conference Speech</b></p>

<p>Thank you so much for giving me the honor of speaking before you again this year. In my 

job, I have to talk to a lot of people, but as you all know, since I still have the heart 

of a gamer, I have the most fun talking to you!</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
Iwata is referring to his <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/595/595089p1.html">Heart 

of a Gamer</a> speech given during the 2004 Game Developers Conference where he detailed 

his origins and the process in which he made it into the video game industry by helping 

establish the company <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/hal-laboratory-company-profile">HAL 

Laboratory</a>.  He was intimately involved in game development for over 10 years 

programming games for the MSX, NES, SNES and GameCube, and so can relate to the other men 

and women in the industry.
</div></p><br>

<p>Once upon a time, way back in the 1980's, a company became number one because its 

products meant 'fun' to young people. Then, in the 1990's, a bigger company with a bigger 

brand name and bigger budgets took away the number one spot. Fortunately, that first 

company also had another line of products that let it remain popular and profitable. This 

company used that threat to reconsider its strategy, and think how it could regain overall 

leadership. And this is what it decided. It would redefine its own business, and expand 

its market beyond current core users. Could this strategy work?  Well, we already know the 

answer. The answer is yes.  Because that first company, Pepsi, has returned to number one 

in its industry displacing Coke. Pepsi stopped asking, 'How can we sell more cola?' 

Instead, it started asking, 'What else do people want to drink?'</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
When Iwata begins this story, the first image that comes to mind is Nintendo.  During the 

'80s, Nintendo was at the height of its dominance in the video game market with the <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=3">NES</a> console.  Nintendo's 

dominance however, was threatened only a few years later with the appearance of the Sega 

Genesis and then again in the '90s, Sony unveiled its PlayStation brand and has since 

replaced Nintendo as the dominant console manufacturer.  As a result, Nintendo has gone 

back to the drawing board in an effort to reconsider its strategy.  Nintendo has decided 

to pursue a new market of non-gamers.  This unique strategy has resulted in its Nintendo 

DS handheld and soon to-be-released Revolution console.  Nintendo is confident these 

platforms will help it regain the lead position in the industry.
</div></p><br>

<p>Today, Pepsi is number one in bottled water. It is number one in sports drinks. It is 

number one in health drinks. And, of course, it remains number one in the snacks business 

that it used to maintain profitability while they executed their disruptive strategy. (As 

every game developer understands, the three basic food groups are Fritos, Cheetos and 

Doritos.)  I am here today to share some stories about Nintendo. But, I begin with a story 

about Pepsi because it demonstrates how thinking differently, and holding strongly to your 

strategy, can disrupt an entire industry ' and in a good way.</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
Iwata's subtle humor is a very nice touch.  I prefer the Cheetos myself.  There are other 

companies besides Pepsi that have created disruption in their respective markets.  Other 

examples include Southwest Airlines, whose low-cost and rural flight destinations have 

allowed it to profit while the rest of the airline industry declares bankruptcy.  Another 

is Apple, who saw an opportunity in simple, stylish digital music players, which allowed 

it to ultimately decimate Sony's Walkman business.  There are many others too including 

Ikea, Dell, Starbucks, and Wal-Mart.  Nintendo was once part of this list of disruptors 

during the '80s.  Iwata is betting he can again renew the company's place atop them.
</div></p><br>

<p>For some time, we have believed the game industry is ready for disruption.  Not just 

from Nintendo, but from all game developers. It is what we all need to expand our 

audience. It is what we all need to expand our imaginations.  Several years ago, when I 

began talking about reaching out to casual gamers and non-gamers, few people listened. 

Today, Nintendo DS is succeeding in disrupting the handheld market in fact, you could 

attribute most industry growth last year to just this one product line. Now, people are 

listening more closely.</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
Iwata's statement was clear even as far back as the 2003 Tokyo Game Show.  In his speech, 

he expressed the concern that games are getting too complex and difficult, making it hard 

for new and casual gamers to get interested in them; his fear was that this will lead to a 

death of several genres, much like fighters and shooters died, because they became overly 

complex and put new gamers off. He also said online gaming is risky, especially when you 

charge the consumer. Iwata believed it bordered on being unethical to demand monthly fees 

to play online games.
</div></p><br>

<p>I know many of you smiled when we demonstrated Nintendogs at the GDC last year, but I'm 

sure not many of you believed it could sell 6 million copies around the world in less than 

a year. But the success of DS is not based on just one game; it is the story of several 

new kinds of software creating brand new players.</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 

238);">Much of the sales for Nintendogs have been to female gamers. It's not often that 

video games are created with this demographic in mind.  In the UK, Nintendo found that the 

usual proportion of girl gamers is about 30 percent but Nintendogs buyers were 55 percent 

female.
</div></p><br>

<p>Let me explain how disruption is working for us. Most of you are very familiar with the 

American market, so let me share some information about Japan. When it launched in 2001, 

Playstation 2 sold 6 million units in its first 21 months. Soon after, our Game Boy 

Advance did even better, reaching 6 million in 20 months. But Nintendo DS is selling at a 

much faster pace than any game system in Japanese history. We have reached sales of 6 

million systems in just 14 months. And, this number would be far higher if production 

could keep up with demand.  In part, the DS success is due to how we redefine better 

technology with unique hardware features. But more importantly, the disruption of Nintendo 

DS comes from how software takes advantage of the hardware.  Over the last year, no 

software has created more discussion (or more surprise) than our 'brain' games. The first 

brain training game, which launched 10 months ago, has sold 1.97 million units. The second 

brain training game, which only launched the last week of last year, has already sold over 

1.8 million units.</p>

<p><b>Brain Training</b></p>

<p>I have been asked many times how we decided to develop these games so I thought maybe 

this is the first story I should share with you today. Where did this idea come from? I'm 

sure you can guess, it started where all great creative ideas begin... from a board of 

directors!  [laughter] When <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=398">Atsushi Asada</a> was a 

member of our Executive Committee, he complained that he knew no one his age who played 

video games. Because Japan is an aging society, he thought a game designed just for 

seniors might work.  I agreed it was a good start, but I said it might be a mistake to 

target only seniors. Instead, maybe something that would appeal to other users, as well. 

This meeting occurred just after the E3 show two years ago - a very busy time for us. We 

were finalizing the Nintendo DS hardware, as well as preparing DS launch games. Even so, I 

asked each of our four main development groups to nominate a few people to serve on a task 

force. Some of them did not have much experience making games, so I got to play the role 

of professor, talking to them not just about games, but about overall product planning. 

The goal of the task force was to invent a game whose appeal would include everyone from 

youngsters to baby boomers to seniors.</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
By all accounts, Nintendo has been successful.  It has been found that one-third of Brain 

Training players are over the age of 35.
</div></p><br>

<p>Our early meetings were just brainstorms and didn't produce any solid ideas. But at 

that time, people in Japan were beginning to read a new book and do its brain exercises. I 

noticed this, and thought it might be a good game idea. Even Mr. Mori, our chief financial 

officer, was doing the exercises himself and convinced me to go forward. Then I consulted 

with Mr. <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Miyamoto</a>, 

and when he got excited, too, I asked the task force to tackle the job. Several of them 

said that just exercising your brain might not be enough. Could there be a way for players 

to measure a 'brain age?' I thought this was a great idea. People would be eager to 

compare their scores. But in fact, no work at all could begin until we came to agreement 

with the author, Dr. Ryuta Kawashima.</p>

<p>Since we were both about the same age, I decided to try to meet with him myself. His 

schedule was very busy, but he agreed he could find just one hour on just one day... the 

very day that the DS was launching in Japan. Not only was his university a long distance 

from our offices, but the meeting itself lasted not one hour, but three. We showed him a 

prototype brain training software and explained how his work might translate to our 

medium. He was enthused, and we started exchanging ideas. The doctor offered to 

demonstrate evidence on how the prototype software was stimulating brain activity. He 

asked if he could borrow one of the team members I had brought along from Nintendo. I 

said, 'Certainly'. You might find this unbelievable, but his assistant then entered with 

something that looked like a metal bowl with wires attached to it, and then he turned it 

upside down, and placed it on my team member's head. It looked like a sci-fi movie from 

the 1950's. The doctor showed that he could determine that the prototype game was changing 

the amount of blood moving across the surface of the brain. This was an important moment 

for all of us.</p>

<p>I'm sure some people at Nintendo wondered how I could spend so much time on the kind of 

meeting on the very day of the DS launch, but I think it turned out to be a good idea. 

Meanwhile, back at Nintendo, we also benefited from some good timing. Internally, we have 

one team we call the 'Development Environmental Group'. They had just finished a library 

of tools for voice and sound recognition for DS. Simultaneously, work on hand-writing 

recognition was also in progress. When they began this work, we all thought these 

functions would be useful for the DS someday, but we had no real idea how. Then suddenly, 

it seemed to Mr. Miyamoto and me they would be a perfect match for this brain game. By 

now, I admit I was getting very enthusiastic about the project. But at first, I don't 

remember that the development team felt quite the same way. I assembled a group of nine 

people and told them that since this wasn't a very complicated programming they should be 

able to finish the first game in just 90 days. And that included the year-end holiday 

period. I could tell they were not happy, but at least with such a short schedule, they 

couldn't waste much time complaining.</p>

<p>My bigger concern was how the market would react, beginning with retailers. Few people 

inside Nintendo believed they would place very big orders... the game was just too different 

from what they knew. Maybe it wasn't even a 'game' at all. So at this point, one member of 

the sales team suggested a new rule. When our salesmen showed the software to retailers, 

even before business was discussed, the first 15 minutes of every meeting must be spent 

with the buyers trying the brain exercises themselves. Oh, when they heard this, the 

retailers hated the idea! They were disgusted, but they had no choice. So they started 

playing, and we could only wait to see how they would react. And how did they respond? 

Well, at this point I think I will take a risk and see if we can reproduce those first 

reactions right here on stage. In order to do that, I'd like to introduce <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=590">Bill Trinen</a> from 

Nintendo of America's localization team, a person who has spent months with Brain Age. 

He'll walk us through a demonstration, and invite a few friends.</p>

<p>[Bill Trinen, from Nintendo of America's localization team, demonstrated the unique 

game play of the new Nintendo DS game, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day, among 

a group of volunteers] Thank you Bill (Trinen), Will (Wright), Geoff (Keighley) and Jamil 

(Moledina).  I think we have now discovered people who are determined to improve their 

brain age! And of course, that is the secret appeal of this game.</p>

<p>Let me add one more note to this story. Those first retailers, after playing the first 

game, agreed to buy a total of 70,000 units, which was still more than our domestic sales 

team expected, but I was not satisfied with that number. But between the launch of the 

first game and the second, you could see a disruption of the market occurring across 

Japan. Something had changed. New people were playing. Seven months later, we returned 

with samples of the second Big Brain Academy game. This time, no demonstrations were 

needed. The retailers quickly placed orders for 850,000 units. And even that turned out 

not to be enough. It recorded the biggest first-week sales for any DS game ever. As of 

right now, the three brain games, including Brain Flex, have sold more than five million 

copies in Japan alone. The moral of this story is pretty clear. If you want to succeed in 

game development, you need to follow two simple rules: First, listen to your board of 

directors.  And second, listen to your chief financial officer. [laughter]</p>

<p>The development of this game came from our belief that people wanted something new. In 

this case, that game took the form of a 'treadmill for the mind'. But we also learned that 

the only real way to demonstrate the appeal of these games is to have people actually play 

them. At Nintendo in Japan, we had employees take the game home and show it to family and 

friends, especially people who weren't game players. Quite a few of our employees were 

surprised that their parents and wives who would never show any interest in gaming were 

suddenly playing this everyday. That helped to build buzz. So, I decided that the same 

thing might work here in America. And that the best time to start is right now.</p>

<p>So, when we're finished this morning, I thought you should test your own brain age to 

play yourself, and to show it to a friend or colleague or even your parents even if they 

have never played games. So as you leave my keynote address, please take a copy of Brain 

Age with you as a gift from Nintendo. Please only take one, and understand that the games 

are only available to pick up when we finish today.</p>

<p><b>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</b></p>

<p>The second story I want to share with you involves disruption of a different sort not 

only taking a different approach to a new technology, but also finding a way to make it 

attractive to everyone and thereby expand the overall audience. The topic was constructing 

the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Many of you know that we have been experimenting with 

networks since the 1980s. Back then, you could use your NES in Japan to trade stocks.</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 

238);">Nintendo has been experimenting with online gaming ever since the original NES.  In 

1988 even, president <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=382">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> and 

Nintendo set about becoming a "communications" company and establishing its own 

"internet". Although not much ever came of it, they've also developed an online model for 

just about every console since.  Check out more information on Nintendo's online history 

in the N-Sider feature <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendonline">NintendOnline</a>.
</div></p><br>

<p>We kept working, but never thought the time was right to introduce a game network until 

Nintendo DS. In 2004, we began considering Wi-Fi gaming. From the start, we had several 

challenges. First, we knew that both Animal Crossing and Mario Kart would be arriving on 

the DS the next year, and we wanted them to feature Wi-Fi play. That made the development 

timetable very short. Secondly, I insisted that our Wi-Fi interface be seamless. I wanted 

connecting to someone around the world to be as easy as connecting to someone playing next 

to you in the same room. As you know, this creates its own problems, because normally 

making things easier for players, makes things harder for developers. But the most 

difficult aspect was deciding who players would be able to connect with. Online gaming 

normally belongs to the most aggressive players, and they can be a very vocal group. For 

the casual player, this kind of interaction can be very intimidating. I believed if we 

catered to only this very vocal group of hard-core players, we could never truly expand 

the audience.</p>

<p>Originally, we thought Wi-Fi should be set up as a kind of social network, almost a 

game-play version of MySpace. In Japan, we initially referred to the Wi-Fi system as 

'project house party'. We had in mind the comfort of inviting friends over to play in your 

own home. Well, at Nintendo of America this name was not very popular. They told us that 

this sounded like what you call a 'tupperware party'. No matter what we called it, I 

believed the experience must be easy and fun. </p>

<p>What did I mean by 'easy?' It's simple to connect a game on DS locally when you're 

sitting in a room with your friends. It should be just as easy to find those friends and 

play with them even if they're thousands of miles away. But what is 'fun?' That depends on 

the player. You may want to play Mario Kart only with people you know. Or you may find it 

more fun to try to defeat total strangers. Sometimes, the choice will be determined by the 

nature of the game. No one playing Animal Crossing wants someone to come in cut down all 

their trees and trash their town. What was important to me was that players have the 

choice, and the freedom to choose which way to play. For developers, 'easy' and 'fun' 

doesn't mean the work will be 'easy' or 'fun'. There were many barriers to overcome. And 

my colleague, Mr. Takao Ohara, will share those stories with you later here at the 

GDC.</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was created with the philosophy of "<i>Easy, Safe, and 

Free.</i>"  Despite or perhaps even in spite of these promises, there has been some 

criticism regarding the service, including the random match-making "Friends" system.  

Although it has been slightly addressed with recent releases such as Metroid Prime 

Hunters, it is the hope of many that Nintendo will have the system perfected by the time 

Revolution launches later this year.  More information can be found in N-Sider's <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendo-wi-fi-connection-faq">Wi-Fi Connection FAQ</a>.  Also, take a look at this interview with <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/global/searchArticles.do?article_id=113">Takao Ohara</a> where he describes the choices made developing the service.
</div></p><br>

<p>In the end, it is the freedom of choice, I believe, that has made the Nintendo Wi-Fi 

Connection so successful. To date, we have surpassed 1 million unique players, totaling 

more than 29 million play sessions ' and, this in only 18 weeks of availability. We 

reached 1 million players almost five times as fast as the Xbox Live service, which also 

offered free connections when it began. It took them 20 months to reach 1 million 

different users. Of course, this has made our Wi-Fi development team very happy as you can 

see. What you can't see is that sign they're holding up, a message to all of you. So let 

me show you what it said: We love the GDC. They all wanted to come, but I told them, 

'Sorry, no'. But I did promise I would bring their picture.</p>

<p>As you know, this week we added a new wrinkle to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Voice 

over internet protocol arrived with Metroid Prime Hunters. It introduces a new level of 

fun. At first, I thought you might like to see a Wi-Fi demonstration of the game. But I 

know Wi-Fi is nothing new for you. In fact, I imagine many of you have already played 

Mario Kart DS wirelessly and seamlessly. Instead, I think the true appeal of the game is 

seen best if we hold our own four-player battle right up here on stage.</p>

<p>Again, I'd like to invite Bill Trinen to come back on stage to get the battle underway. 

[Bill Trinen, from Nintendo of America's localization team, demonstrated the wireless game 

play capability of the Nintendo DS game, Metroid Prime Hunters, among a group of 

volunteers] Thank you, everyone. I know I am much better watching this game than playing 

it.</p>

<p>When we talk about expanding the market to new players, many times this means new kinds 

of software, but certainly not always. I hope that Metroid Prime Hunters shows we're not 

turning our backs on the kind of games that current core players already love. We will 

serve all tastes. Our new Tetris DS is something even your grandmother will enjoy. On the 

other hand, you can compete head to head with nine different people on a local network, or 

three others via Wi-Fi. We are also going to bring our first all-new Super Mario Bros. 

game to the DS in a matter of a few weeks. For those of you who have been waiting for the 

next great Mario game'this is for you. </p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
Iwata uses Metroid Prime Hunters as an example to comfort concerns of fans who feel 

Nintendo may be forgetting about them in the company's pursuit of the non-gamer.  More 

examples of Nintendo still catering to its existing fans include The Legend of Zelda: 

Twilight Princess for Nintendo GameCube and Super Smash Bros. Online for Revolution.
</div></p><br>

<p>And because you're all such game fans, I've decided to reveal one more brand new 

adventure for you today. [The audience was shown a demo reel of the The Legend of Zelda: 

Phantom Hourglass] The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, is designed exclusively for the 

DS. It will launch later this year. It's a product of Mr. Aonuma and the team that has 

created most of the Zelda hits in the past. You will be seeing and playing Zelda both on 

DS and Nintendo Gamecube at E3.</p>

<p><b>Revolution Controller</b></p>

<p>The third story I have to share is the answer to a question people ask me all the time: 

how did we get the idea for the Revolution free-hand controller? Well, we started out with 

a very simple question: why is it that anyone feels comfortable picking up a remote 

control for a TV, but many people are afraid to even touch the controller for a video game 

system?  This was our starting point.</p>

<p>Our first controller meetings began early in 2004, and from that initial thought we 

added two other requirements. First, the controller must be wireless. We need to give 

players freedom to move. And second, the look of the controller had to be simple and 

non-threatening. But of course, at the same time, it had to be sophisticated enough to 

serve the needs of complex games. And yes, we also wanted it to be 'revolutionary'. 

Finding an answer to all of this was not easy. For more than six months, two people at NCL 

did nothing but produce sketch after sketch with new ideas. Each sketch caused more 

discussion, and the discussions led us to create dozens of prototype designs. In all, 

about 15 people were involved trying to figure out an answer. At the same time, I was 

considering technologies which would incorporate a direct pointing device, something that 

would show direct visual contact between the controller and the screen. In fact, many good 

ideas were floating around, but nothing yet felt revolutionary.</p>

<p><div style="margin: 0px 30px; padding: 10px; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 238);">
Years from now, we'll probably look back to 2004 as one of the most significant years in 

Nintendo's history.  It marked a turning point for Nintendo and its strategy.  Recall this 

was the year that Nintendo unveiled its new mascot in the form of <a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</a>, 

its North American Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.  Nintendo also debuted 

its Nintendo DS system -- a "developers' system" that allowed new forms of gameplay, 

design and expression through two screens, touch, voice recognition and wireless play.  

Finally, Nintendo acknowledged the requests of fans and showcased video of a new realistic 

Legend of Zelda for GameCube.
</div></p><br>

<p>Early last year a young team leader of the controller development group came up with a 

disruptive idea: what if you could play with just one hand? Mr. Miyamoto quickly imagined 

a small, simple, wireless device. That intrigued us, but we realized an immediate problem. 

Considering our plans, how would we allow backward compatibility to all the previous 

Nintendo games that required two-hand control? Again, Mr. Miyamoto had an answer: make the 

small wireless controller detachable from a larger, traditional controller ' both using 

the same wireless interface. This sounded good, but when we shared the idea with our 

Metroid Prime producers, they objected. They said their games would not work with what we 

invented. They added another idea: Why not keep the simple one-hand controller, but also 

add a secondary device for the other hand if the game required it? ' Something like a 

nun-chuk device. We think this is something that will entirely change firstperson shooter 

games. By separately using the joystick device to control position and the direct pointing 

device to target enemies the experience truly feels more intuitive.</p>

<p>Now, we really went to work. There were dozens of models and prototypes fabricated 

until we came up with the final result. And what did it look like? Well, it looked exactly 

like the same TV remote control that we first imagined more than a year earlier. Sometimes 

ideas are like good wine in that they just need time. After all the designs and mockups, 

we were happy with the final result. It met our goals. It was wireless. It was inviting to 

new players. It offered something brand new for core players. And, it was also a new 

interface we could offer to every player. But, it also represented something else. As you 

can imagine, this was a very expensive process. Not only in terms of the research and 

development costs, but also the manufacturing expense of producing such an elaborate 

control system, and including it as part of every hardware purchase.</p>

<p><b>Virtual Console</b></p>

<p>Some people put their money on the screen, but we decided to spend ours on the game 

experience. It is an investment in actual market disruption. Not simply to improve the 

market ' but disrupt it. We believe a truly new kind of game entertainment will not be 

realized unless there is a new way to connect a player to his game. 'New' is good, but 

there also is an appetite for 'old'. For young players, classic games are brand new. For 

others, they are a way to feel young again.</p>

<p>After we announced the virtual console concept for revolution last year, many people 

asked me if only games for Nintendo systems would be available. Today, I have a better 

answer. I can announce that games specifically developed for both the Sega Genesis and the 

NEC Turbo Grafx system will also be available for Nintendo Revolution via the Virtual 

Console. Between them, these systems built a library of more than a thousand different 

games. Of course, not all of them will be available, but the best of them will.</p>

<p> Thank you for listening to my stories this morning. However, the most important story 

of all is still to be told. I hope all of you, the creative force of our industry, will 

help us write it. It is the story of how disruption will help every one of us overcome the 

growing barriers to game development. We know what the main barrier is cost. There is one 

dominant business model for our industry. Publishers work backwards from a console game at 

retail that sells for $50 or now, even $60. To compete at that level, games must be 

longer, larger and more complex, which requires bigger development teams. Success is more 

likely if a strong license is acquired, but even then, huge amounts of money are needed to 

market that game to a mass audience.</p>

<p>It's understandable that many publishers, in order to reduce risk, feel most 

comfortable relying on sequels to already successful, high budget games. As a result, our 

business is beginning to resemble a bookstore where you can only buy expensive, full sets 

of encyclopedias. No romance novels. No paperbacks. No magazines. In our business, too 

often people with a fresh idea don't have a chance. I believe if Tetris were presented 

today, here is what the producer would be told: "Go back; give me more levels; give me 

better graphics; give me cinematics; and you're probably going to need a movie license to 

sell that idea to the public." The producer would go away dejected. Today, Tetris might 

never be made.</p>

<p>Nintendo understands the dominant business model. We work with it every day. And future 

Zeldas and Marios and Metroids are going to be bigger masterpieces than ever before. But, 

this does not have to be the only business model. We want to help you create a new one. 

One where your simple Tetris will be made. With Nintendo Revolution, we offer a 

combination of opportunities that simply can't be matched. Our controller allows for every 

existing form of game to take on a new character. It allows for game creation that is not 

dependent on just the size of the development budget. I consider our virtual console 

concept the video game version of Apple's iTunes music store.</p>

Nintendo is clear about its intent to seek new and current gamers.  From the sounds of it, 

games on the Virtual Console will be compatible with the Revolution controller.  Finally, 

it's exciting to hear that Nintendo feels its service will be the video game version of 

Apple's iTunes music store.  Nintendo will be in a very good position if it can offer the 

same breadth and simplicity.

<p>Since I first announced the virtual console concept last year at E3, other people have 

become very interested in digital downloads. Others will offer such a service, but it will 

not be the same. Because for us, this is not just a new business opportunity, for us, this 

is true innovation - true disruption. It is part of our DNA. The digital download process 

will bring new games to the widest possible audience of new players. Young people, older 

people, even those who never played video games before. When I think of what faces all of 

us right now, I imagine what it must have been like for the explorers who first set foot 

on a new continent. For them, it was impossible to imagine all the adventure that lay 

ahead.</p>

Iwata is excited about the Virtual Console.  It's an idea the company has been 

contemplating ever since the NES and has even executed with the SNES Satellaview in Japan 

and the iQue in China.  We should probably take note of the fact how Nintendo labels the 

Virtual Console "true disruption."  It sounds as though Nintendo still has some surprises 

in store for us.  It was revealed recently that Nintendo will also offer new content.  

It'll be interesting to see what ratio of new and old content ultimately appears on the 

service.

<p>Our adventure is still ahead of us. Nintendo is committed to creating an environment 

where all of your work can prosper. I began today saying that disruption is not just a 

strategy for Nintendo. Yes, we have already disrupted handheld and it worked. Yes, we have 

already disrupted Wi-Fi and it worked. We disrupted the very definition of a "game" and 

that is working, too. In a few weeks, you will better understand how to disrupt console 

gaming. You will play, and you will see. At Nintendo, we do not run from risk. We run to 

it. We are taking the risk to move beyond current boundaries. It should be our goal, each 

of us, to reach the new players as well as the current players. Our goal is to show them 

surprise. Our reward is to convince them that above all video games are meant to be just 

one thing - "fun." Fun for everyone.</p>

<p>Thank you again so much for inviting me.</p>

And that wraps 'er up.  Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with how candid Iwata is during 

his speeches.  If he doesn't write them, whomever does deserves a pat on the back.  It 

contains that perfect balance of humor, business and pure Nintendo.  What are your <a
