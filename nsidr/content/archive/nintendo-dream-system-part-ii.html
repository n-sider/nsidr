<p><center><h3>Nintendo Dream System: Part II</h3></center></p>

<p>This is <b>Part II</b> of our Nintendo DS "Nintendo Dream System" feature.  The first part can be found <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendo-dream-system">here</a>.  While Part I was created by the N-Sider staff, the second part is composed entirely of ideas submitted by you the reader.  Enjoy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">Time DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Neil Tan</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>Imagine two worlds, two dimensions overlapping each other in the same space and time.  Now, imagine that there are powers among certain items or weapons that bring its possessor into both dimensions at the same time.  Hell be able to see both worlds occupants and distinguish them apart.  They can also see him, but both worlds wont see each other.  On the Nintendo DS, youll be able to see a light world and a dark world separately on each screen.  One will have the usual fantasy worlds of kingdoms, merchants, soldiers, mythical creatures, etc. while the other will be a high tech, post apocalyptic world filled with demons, monsters, slaved humans, freedom fighters, etc.  This RPG will be from a 2-D overhead perspective.</p>

<p>What well have here is a hero that occupies both screens at the same time.  Hell be able to talk to NPCs or fight monsters on one world with the consequence of being looked upon as crazy or dangerous in the other world.  If a monster and an NPC of two separate dimensions occupy the same space in time, a player will need to be careful not to attack the monster or risk killing the NPC (and most likely have palace guards after him) as well.  In cases when two friendly NPCs occupy the same space, a player might confuse them both with what he says as hell have to pay attention to what both NPCs are saying.  For example, responding "Yes" could lead one NPC happy while making the other feel uncomfortable or angry.  On the other hand, if two monsters or villain occupy the same space during battles, a swipe of a sword will hurt both.</p>

<p>In terms of other strategies, though landscapes will generally be similar, there will always be obstacles or buildings in the way in one of two or both worlds.  There may be a bridge in one world while there may not be one in the other.  The player will need to know when to drop his magical item or weapon (that allows him to exist in both dimensions) so as to bring him back to focus in his native dimension.  Eventually, hell meet allies along the way; theyll come to understand the power the main character holds.  They will be key to certain objectives depending on which world they are local to.  The magical item or weapon can be moved from one party member to another.   If one character can fly over a chasm, for instance, the player can toss him his magical weapon, allow him to cross the bridge in his dimension, then regain the weapon from his friend afterwards.  During battles, if surrounded by enemies, the player can throw his weapon far away in the distance or throw it over to his friend, disappear from his foes, move away in his dimension, and reappear again once he gets the item back.  In some cases though, you might risk letting an enemy get that item or weapon thatll have him exist in both dimension.  However, since hes only one enemy, the player could still overcome it.</p>

<p>Items will be constantly carried around but those indigenous to one world and cannot be found in the other will be unusable if the player does not possess the magical artifact.  Further into the adventure, more similar items allowing inter-dimension travel can be given to party members.  Some enemies will eventually have similar weapons or artifacts to make the journey more difficult but many of the rules established will still be in place.  Lastly, to incorporate the probable stylus feature of the DS, players will be able to draw spell castings on the screen.  Players can cast a firewall by drawing a line or shape to where one can appear.  He can also target specific enemies with certain spells.  Needless to say you can only write on one screen so in order to hit anyone on the other screen, a player is going to have to make his own estimates as to where he wants to cast a spell.</p>

<b><font size="3">'GB' Camera 2.0 DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Will Walton</font><br>

<p>With the size of Digital cameras nowadays, hopefully it can just sit 
on top, and swivel with the 'clamshell' screen set up, or however it's 
finally set up. With the 'GB' Camera 2.0, you can take a picture of 
yourself, and put yourself in the game at a decent resolution. And thanks to 
the stylus, you can paint all over it. Then, thanks to the connectivity 
features included, you can export the image into upcoming games, and 
add the image onto the main character's face. (Animal Crossing 2?)</p>

<p>I think a great idea for the DS that could utilize the dual screens. - you could have your typical fantasy hero kind of character (Link might 
work...) that has been blessed with the ability to see the light and 
dark sides of our world, almost like A Link to the Past.  Anyway, each 
screen could represent a side (one for the Light side, another for the 
Dark side).  This could be fun in a number of ways.  Maybe some enemies 
are pure evil and could only be seen on the dark screen, while maybe a 
bridge or palace of light could only be seen on the light screen.  It 
would be really neat to fight enemies on the dark side while standing 
in a location that can only be seen on the light side!  You would still 
have the same hero on both screens, just different views on the same 
place.</p>

<p>One screen would be a side view of the action (think R-Type) while the 
other screen would be an over the top view (think 1942).
On the side view, the player can only move his/her ship UP and DOWN.
The other screen would focus on the LEFT and RIGHT movements of the 
ship.
The action would be realtime and the player must utilize both screens 
in 
order to hit ships and dodge bullets.  This would provide an incredible 
challenge that demands the player to use both screens in order to 
progress.</p>

<p>This type of game could even be made into a more simpler style of 
gameplay 
where the object of the game is to guide a ship through terrain to 
reach the 
end.  Of couse, as you progress through the levels the side scrolling 
action 
speeds up.</p>

<p>One screen would focus on the defensive side of the game while the 
other 
screen focuses on the offensive side.</p>

<p>For example let's take you through a pitch and hit.  If you are the 
pitcher 
you would focus your eyes on the defensive screen as the camera is 
positioned behind the pticher.  This would allow you to see more 
clearly 
where and how hard a ball is contacted by a batter.  The batter on the 
other 
hand would focus his view on the other screen.  This offensive screen 
provides a view behind the batter, and is dedicated soley for the 
purpose of 
hitting the baseball.  As soon as the baseball is hit both screens 
change.</p>

<p>The defensive screen switches to a camera positioned behind the fielder 
that 
is making the play on the ball.  The offensive screen switches to an 
overview of the baseball field allowing you to more easily see your 
baserunners and react appropriately.</p>

<p>A good player would utilize both screens to make decisions on the 
field.</p>

<p>The second screen could be used as an inventory screen. One tap would equip items, such as in Link to the Past, where you could only equip one item, it would work well. Another idea I saw floating around the Planet GameCube boards, as well as other boards, was again in Link to the Past, where the primary screen would be normal, while the other screen would show the Dark world. Again, the secondary screen would also work well for the map and other sub screens, since you could easily tap the screen and change the pages. Another idea is to have the primary screen look like the Ocarina Zelda, and have the second screen look like Link's Awakening or Link to the Past style-Zeldas.</p>

<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>Nintendo could expand on the battle game of Super Mario Bros. 3. Since the DS is supposedly wireless, many players could easily play the battle game, and when one Mario went off screen, he would appear on the other screen.</p>

<b><font size="3">Kirby DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>This is a weird idea, but since Kirby swallows stuff, the second screen would show his stomach! It sounds weird, but it could open up game play possibilities.</p>

<b><font size="3">Squad Game DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p> 

<p>The second screen would list commands and orders for games like Rainbow Six. It would also work well for an Unreal Tournament game, so you could easily select your taunt and press it, without holding a key on a keyboard.</p>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">StarTropics DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>I doubt a new Startropics game would be made, but remember the sequence in the first where you played the organ? That would make an enjoyable application for the touchscreen. It would also work well with the Ocarina and various instruments of the Zelda games.</p>

<b><font size="3">Aliens vs. Predator DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>Remember in the first Predator film, how he would use a touchscreen for just about everything? That would be a natural choice, so you could fire weapons, self-destruct and much more. Also, the second screen could be the motion tracker for the Marine.</p>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">Harvest Moon DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>You could do the brushing of the animals with the touchscreen, and maybe use the other screen to watch for important events, so you would not miss them.</p>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">Matrix Reloaded DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>You could recreate the fight much easier between Neo and the hundreds of Smiths with two screens. That way, in that hectic fight, you would not have to worry about the camera getting in the way! Also, somehow it would be cool to use the touchscreen to simulate Neo stopping the bullets.</p>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">Lord of the Rings DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>This is useful in many games, but I see it as being cool in the LOTR movie games. You would have the fellowship, and you could switch to any character instantly, by touching their picture on the touchscreen.</p>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">Diablo DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Luke Justis</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>This would only work if the touchscreen was durable, but the player would fight by tapping on the touchscreen rather than using a mouse.</p>

<p><blockquote><center><hr></center>
<b><font size="3">Messenger DS</font></b><br>
<font size="2">By Alberto Bolton</font><br>
<center><hr></center></blockquote></p>

<p>I think since the DS is using bluetooth technology you can talk using a 
instant messager or a chat room with people around your neighbourhood 
and so 
on the second screen (since its rumoured a touch screen)  its have all 
the 
letters and stuff on the second screen, and to talk you could touch the 
letters on the screen to type what your going to say and on the first 
screen 
you can be playing a video game, so you could talk on a Instant 
messanger or 
a chat room  AND play your video game AT THE SAME TIME (of course you 
probably would want to pause the game when you talk)</p>
