<blockquote>
<p>WHAM!: How are you going to market the DS so that youll make sure that it doesnt encroach on the GBA line? How are you going to make the public understand that theyre two separate systems?</p>

<p>Ron Bertram: Well thats our markings job. But quite frankly, its a more sophisticated gaming experience, it does completely different things so we have to accurately pick that out and say, look youve thought of gaming always this way, like Reggie said youve always been going down this road and this is taking down a road youve never been before and thats the analogy, we have to communicate that theres another way to play games. Its a radically different experience, and the touch screen is different than anything youve ever experienced before, and the wireless capabilities take it way beyond previous experiences. So thats the challenge that we have to communicated, and were just beginning to meet to figure out how we communicate that. This is the first step [E3] showing the product, and getting feedback.</p>
