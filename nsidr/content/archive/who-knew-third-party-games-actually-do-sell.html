Capcom and Sega are both trumpeting successes on Wii this week, defying commonly-held wisdom that third parties can't compete on Wii.<br />
<br />
Capcom announced yesterday that on-rails shooter and Zapper poster-boy <i>Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles</i> has shipped (yes, "shipped", not "sold") a million units worldwide.  Separately, in a phone interview with Next Generation, Sega COO Simon Jeffery noted that his company's <i>Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games</i> has sold five million copies worldwide.<br />
