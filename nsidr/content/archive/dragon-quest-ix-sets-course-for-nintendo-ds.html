Fresh off the mid-night frantic translation newswire comes the relatively Earth-shattering <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/blog/express/2006/12/ixds.html" target="_blank">news</a>  that <i>Dragon Quest IX</i> is set to be an exclusive on the Nintendo DS.<br />

Dragon Quest IX: Defenders of the Stars is being developed by Level-5, most recently renowned for their involvement in 2005's <i>DQ VIII</i> for the Playstation 2.  In addition, DQ dream team members Yuji Horii and composer Koichi Sugiyama are both involved with the title, which promises to be "not a gaiden or side-story, but a true part of the series," in the words of Horii.<br />
<br />
Though full details are sparse, the game reportedly features a more action-oriented battle system with the possibility for four-player cooperative play and connectivity with Nintendo's Wi-Fi service.<br />
<br />
The title is scheduled for Japanese release in mid-2007.
