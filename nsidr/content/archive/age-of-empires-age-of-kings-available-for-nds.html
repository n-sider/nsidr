The title was published by Majesco and developed by Mecca Electronics.  Age of Empires: Age of Kings currently has an 82 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/927039.asp?q=age%20of%20empires">GameRankings.com</a> (based on 10 reviews).<br><br>

The game is based on Ensemble Studio's PC series however the Nintendo DS version takes a new approach.  Instead of a real-time gameplay, Age of Empires: The Age of Kings allows players to use a turn-based strategy system.  The game includes five civilizations and 50 unique types of units.  Players construct buildings and manage their army with a goal of conquering civilization through the ages.  Multiplayer scenarios allow up to 4 players to battle each other wirelessly.
