<p>I apologize for the lack of N-Data updates this week.  You see, there's been a death in my family.  Would you please join in a moment of silence with me for my beloved Super Nintendo.  May she rest in peace.  On a much brighter note, here are the worthwhile updates for Sunday, February 15, 2004.</p>

<p>The launch of N-Universe will be delayed for the time being.  Things have been moving slower than expected.  We hope you understand and bear with us during this time of adjustment.  Also, the other sections of N-Data are still coming!  We thank you again for your patience.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the site, N-Data or what apparel Cory wears to bed, feel free to send an email to the N-Sider staff at <a mailto:"staff@n-sider.com">staff@n-sider.com</a>.</p>
