<i>Manhunt 2</i> has been a hot topic these past few days. It's a very violent game and sees a lot of controversy as a result. Only two days ago, the game was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2877">banned from release</a> in the UK, and Italy followed suit earlier today. The real kicker, though, is the ESRB rating for North America. Following the UK ban, publisher Take Two <a href="http://gamepolitics.com/2007/06/19/breaking-manhunt-2-rated-adults-only-by-esrb/">announced</a> the ESRB rating: Adults Only.<br />
<br />
GameSpot is <a href="http://au.gamespot.com/news/6172830.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=morenews&tag=morenews;title;1">reporting</a> that both Sony and Nintendo are sticking to their policy regarding AO-rated games; they will not license Manhunt 2 for release with such a rating. Rockstar, however, has gone on record claiming that they believe the game should have a Mature rating and are currently exploring their options in getting that rating.<br />
<br />
The first game in the series&mdash;not released on a Nintendo console&mdash;received a Mature rating and was banned from Australia. Manhunt 2 is already seeing a much worse reaction.
