<p>Via GamesIndustry.biz comes <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=18205">a report from the Commercial Times</a> that chip suppliers for Nintendo's upcoming <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Wii</a> home console are reporting large orders, though they're not saying who from.</p>

<p>Graphics-chip maker ATi, who will be supplying Wii's "Hollywood" graphics chip, is saying that its consumer electronics chip business has risen 5% to 20% of its total business.  "Hollywood" <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1968">has been confirmed</a> to support 480p resolution as well as both 4&times;3 and 16&times;9 aspect ratios.</P>

<p>In addition, PixArt Imaging, responsible for motion-sensing technology used in the Wii Remote controller, is reporting a rise in orders and expects to ship a million units this coming August.  GamesIndustry.biz suggests this indicates Wii will launch with a considerable lead over Sony's PlayStation 3.</p>

<p>Nintendo recently <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2276">reconfirmed its intent</a> to release Wii in the fourth quarter of this year, and it plans to make pricing and availability announcements in September.</p>
