Although only released on PlayStation 2, <i>Katamari Damacy</i> is a title that any Nintendo fan can appreciate and relate to.  The game was directed by Keita Takahashi and developed by Namco.  It was a game that was based on a simple premise: take a sticky ball and make it grow by rolling it around and collecting items.  However, the most important aspect of the game was its sense of "fun".

BBC News recently interviewed Takahashi and questioned him about his future plans in the video game industry.  Takahashi openly admits he didn't want to make the follow-up <i>We <3 Katamari</i> saying he would have preferred creating something new.
<br><br>
"I didn't want players to be disappointed so I decided to take part," he said. "There are fun things are in the game, though I am not happy with all of it." 
<br><br>He says he finds the current atmosphere of the industry to have too many barriers for people with unique ideas.  His thoughts closely reflect Nintendo's, who likewise feels that in this next-generation there must be something new and exciting brought to the video game experience. "Developers want to come up with fun games but ideas are judged by their sales potential," he said. "The reality is that decisions are driven by sales and marketing."

Takahashi admits that perhaps if things don't change, he would like to try something different outside of the realm of video games. "In 10 years time, I am not going to be making games any more," he said.  "I would like to create a playground for children.  A normal playground is flat but I want an undulating one, with bumps."
