Agetec has announced they will be bringing <i>Rhythm 'n Notes</i>, a music education title that offers tonal and rhythmic music training through piano and drumming games, to Nintendo DS&mdash;and we've got <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=5308&view=screens">screenshots</a>.<br />
<br />
Rhythm 'n Notes' note lessons help players recognize and identify not only notes but also complex chords, and rhythm exercises work on players' timekeeping and rhythm pattern skills.  Rhythm 'n Notes will have lessons for skill levels from beginner to advanced, and features an open practice mode to help players familiarize themselves with notes and chords, both by name and sound.  Drumming is done with the stylus on the touch screen, and piano games have you match the note played through the speaker to the proper keys.<br />
<br />
Rhythm 'n Notes was developed by IE Institute, a Japanese educational software developer whose titles have shown up many times on DS sales lists, and is set for a North American release this fall.
