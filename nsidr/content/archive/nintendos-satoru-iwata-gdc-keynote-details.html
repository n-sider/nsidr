<p>It was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1715">mentioned</a> earlier this week that Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> would deliver a keynote speech at the Game Developers Conference in San Jose.  The wire this morning provides some more specifics on what exactly will be discussed and when. Iwata's speech will take place on Thursday, March 23, from 10:30 to 11:30am.</p>

<p>Entitled "Disrupting Development," Iwata's speech will appeal to developers to take more risks and use their imagination as a tool to further the games industry.  Iwata will discuss some recent success stories Nintendo has had in this arena and also look to how the company's next-generation consoles will further the goal.</p>

<p>Here's a reminder too that Nintendo of America's executive vice president of marketing, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reggie Fils-Aime</a>, will be speaking at <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1690">DICE</a>  on February 9.  His speech is entitled "Expanding the Market for Interactive Entertainment." Reggie will likely be reiterating Nintendo's strategy as the company jumps into the next-generation with Nintendo DS and Nintendo Revolution.</p>
