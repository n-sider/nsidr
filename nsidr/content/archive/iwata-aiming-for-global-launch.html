<p><a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/">Next Generation</a> is <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1426&Itemid=2">reporting on Iwata's intent for a global launch</a> of Nintendo's next console, code-named Revolution.</p>

<p>In an interview with Nikkei Business, Iwata said, "It will be launched in 2006, after the end of our financial year.  We are hoping to launch simultaneously around the world, as far as that is possible."  This news narrows the previously-announced launch window of 2006 slightly to April-December 2006.</p>
