<p>Nintendo Co. in Japan has posted <a href="http://touch-ds.jp/mfs/dsbrowser/intro.html">a video</a> on their Touch! DS site showing the upcoming Opera Software-developed <cite>Nintendo DS Browser</cite> in action.</p>

<p>The video shows off the browser's unique two-screen mode which shows the entire width of the page as it would appear on a personal computer screen on the Nintendo DS's touch screen, and drag a viewport around with the stylus magnifying the selected area onto the top screen.  Tapping an icon on the toolbar at the bottom sends the zoomed-out view to the top screen so the user can interact with elements such as links in the zoomed-in view on the touch screen.</p>

<p>Also shown is the browser's two-screen mode, where both screens are linked together to create a tall view, and the browser's handwriting recognition options as well as virtual keyboards, optimized for tasks like entering URLs.</p>

<p>The Nintendo DS Browser launches in Japan next week Monday, July 24.  Europeans <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2298">will get a localized version</a> on October 6.  Nintendo of America has yet to announce plans for bringing Nintendo DS Browser to the States&mdash;stay tuned.</p>
