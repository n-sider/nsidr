Breaking a longstanding tradition of putting out titles of questionable quality every Monday, it seems Nintendo has decided to revive the oft-spoken-of but rarely-touched Game Boy Advance bit Generations series&#8212;which never made it out of Japan, due to the GBA's impending demise&#8212;on WiiWare today.  Enter <i>Art Style: Orbient</i>.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3776-1.jpeg" width="158" height="119" class="image_styled" /></div>It is, perhaps, a delightful coincidence that I was just playing <i>Orbital</i>, the GBA game which <i>Orbient</i> is based on, the other night&#8212;putting off the final sequence in <i>Baten Kaitos Origins</i> for the weekend when I knew I'd have time to face down hours of cutscenes.  <i>Orbital</i>'s premise is simple: float your initially-tiny interplanetary body around with just two controls&#8212;attract and repel&#8212;absorbing smaller planets to make yours bigger and grabbing your own satellites for bonus points.  It's almost a Zen experience, with your movement dependent only on the interplanetary flotsam and jetsam around you as you seek to eventually devour or acquire your own little universe, piece-by-piece.<br />
<br />
I haven't yet got my hands on <i>Orbient</i>, but I plan to as soon as I can.  In the meantime, look forward to what else might show up in the Art Style series.  bit Generations was a cool collection of really sweet little games, and they deserve your attention.
