<p><a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/">Nintendo-Europe</a> sat down with the creative mind of Yoot Saito.  Although the name may not bring any pictures to mind, you might be familiar with his games -- Seaman for Dreamcast and Odama for GameCube.  His development team, known as Vivarium, is hard at work on a new title for the Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>"The Nintendo DS is a wonderful handheld," Saito told Nintendo Europe.  "I'm glad it comes with a built-in microphone. That's why we have things planned for it. We're working on a different title right now that will use the network and microphone, but unfortunately I can't really discuss it yet."</p>

<p>Saito has used a microphone extensively in his past games.  In the game Seaman, players had conversations through a microphone to a fish-like creature.  In the company's most recent title, Odama, characters speak through a microphone to encourage and direct troops in battle.</p>
