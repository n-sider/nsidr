Ubisoft is pulling copies of <i>Mind Quiz</i> off shelves over offense taken  at the term "spastic"&mdash;normally derogatorily applied to those with disabilities, but used in the game to a rank poor performance&mdash;following <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6253688.stm">complaints</a> by a Belfast woman aired on a BBC radio show.<br />
<br />
"As soon as we were made aware of the issue we stopped distribution of the product and are now working with retailers to pull the game off the market," a spokesperson for Ubisoft told the BBC.  "The game was developed in Japan, and we unfortunately did not pick up on the offending word in our quality assurance. We are currently working with the developer to find a way to rectify the issue." <br />

Mind Quiz is among Ubisoft's entries in the ever-growing field of brain games, a field led by Nintendo's own <i>Brain Age</i>.  It appeared on both DS and Sony's PlayStation Portable.
