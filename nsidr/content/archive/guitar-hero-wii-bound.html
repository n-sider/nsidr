<p>Activision CEO Robert Kotick said in a speech at a recent conference that PlayStation 2 music game <cite>Guitar Hero II</cite> <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10948">will go multiplatform</a>, "on every significant new format."</p>

<p>What exactly Kotick means by "significant" is certainly up in the air, but given the current media climate, it seems Nintendo's Wii could well be a contender.  A guitar shell would be a good fit for the Wii Remote, allowing the Remote to slot in and taking advantage of its built-in motion-sensing capabilities to replace the tilt sensitivity in the current PlayStation 2 guitar controller RedOctane makes for the game.  In addition, such a move would make the guitar controller completely wireless with no extra components required.</p>

<p>Activision bought <cite>Guitar Hero</cite> maker RedOctane earlier this year, which entitles them to make such pronouncements.  Guitar Hero II is already slated for release on the PlayStation 2 on November 7; future platform releases are yet unannounced.</p>
