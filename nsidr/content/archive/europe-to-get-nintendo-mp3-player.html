<p>Nintendo has confirmed to GamesIndustry.biz that the Nintendo MP3 Player is <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=19475">headed for Europe</a>.</p>

<p>The device, which is advertised for Nintendo DS but is also compatible with Game Boy Advance, allows users to play music off Secure Digital cards up to 2GB in size.  Last year in Japan, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=780">released the Play-Yan</a>, which provided Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS with similar functionality&mdash;except Play-Yan could also play video and minigames called "Garage Games".</p>

<p>Release date and pricing are not yet confirmed, nor has the hardware been announced for any kind of American release.</p>
