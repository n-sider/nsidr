From Nintendo comes official word that the oft-anticipated <i>Super Paper Mario</i> is due out in North America on April 9, 2007, as (partially) previously rumored.<br />
<br />
Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-preview-super-paper-mario">preview</a> of the game from last May, when it was still slated for a GameCube release.  The release promises to help fill out the somewhat sparingly-peppered first-party Wii release schedule, and should provide April with the slam-bang double-shot of both Mario and <i>Pokemon</i>.  <br />

Nintendo has also chosen to creatively release a few more details through their press release:<br />

on the 9th Day of April 2007<br />
<br />
The nuptials will take place at the beginning of Super Paper Mario, which will be available for Nintendo's hot new Wii home video game system. Those who wish to attend - or thwart - the ceremony will need to switch between 2-D and 3-D.</div><br />
No word yet on garter-tossing or awkward drunken proclamations.
