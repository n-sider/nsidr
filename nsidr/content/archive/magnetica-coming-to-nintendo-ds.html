<p>Nintendo of America will publish Magnetica for the Nintendo DS, according to 

<a href="http://ds.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=3377">AdvancedMN</a>.  

Developed by Mitchell, the game was previously released in Japan under the 

name of Puzzloop.  The game is described as a strategic puzzle where players 

must stop the onslaught of marbles from reaching the end.  Players shoot 

marbles into the descending ones, where matching three colors in a row will 

make them disappear.  The game is said to make good use of the Nintendo DS 

touch screen feature.  Magnetica is scheduled for release on June 5, 2006.</p>
