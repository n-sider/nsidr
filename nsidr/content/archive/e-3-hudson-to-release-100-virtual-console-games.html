<p>While speaking with Hudson Soft earlier today, <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/708/708057p1.html">IGN.com</a> learned that the company intends to bring as much as 100 TurboGrafx titles to Nintendo's Virtual Console.  The company is known for such series as Bomberman, Bonk, Adventure Island and Lode Runner.</p>

<p>According to one Hudson representative, the company is also looking to release third-party titles released on TurboGrafx from companies that no longer exist. Hudson has "every single one of [their] lawyers checking into it."</p>

<p>Thus far Hudson Soft's TurboGrafx title Bonk's Adventure is the only officially announced game for the Virtual Console.  Stay tuned as this list grows.</p>
