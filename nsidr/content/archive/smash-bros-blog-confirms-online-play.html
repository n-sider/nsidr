Naysayers (like myself) said it couldn't be done, but <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> creator <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=982">Masahiro Sakurai</a> confirmed in today's post on the <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/index.html">Smash Bros. Dojo</a> site that the title will offer online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">This game supports Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. If you connect your Wii to the Internet, you can enjoy linked battles with distant people!<br />
<br />
But because this form of communication is greatly affected by the distance between you and your opponent, your brawls may not run smoothly if you're really far apart&mdash;like, for instance, if you're connecting between Japan and America.<br />
<br />
The more distant you are, the worse your connection becomes, and the slower it feels. I apologize, but I hope you understand.</div><br />
Both "With Friends" (based on Friend Codes) and "With Anyone" battles (where you won't see your opponents' names) will be available, and while you're waiting for a match to start, you get to practice on a sandbag, marking the smartest move ever for a WFC game.<br />
<br />
More Wi-Fi services are planned and will be revealed at a later date, as Brawl's December 3rd (November 22 in Japan) release approaches.
