E3 2007 was a completely different experience from years' past, as you can get the gist of by reading the our <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-2007-liveblog-archive">liveblog</a> from that event.<br />
<br />
To substantially decrease what was considered to be outrageous spending by the biggest publishers and hardware manufacturers, E3 was scaled down in size, pulled out from the Los Angeles Convention Center and then spread out in small chunks over Santa Monica. The biggest change was a focus on the smaller meetings, all organized by the publishers themselves, as opposed to one large show floor where people were free to come and go as they pleased.<br />
<br />
The resulting show was rather inefficient, with inter-hotel travel sucking up a lot of the media attendees' time.  In an apparent effort to combat this problem, the ESA (Entertainment Software Association) has announced in a press release that it is moving the show back to the LACC, to put it once again under one roof&#8212;but the convention will not contain any of the fanfare of the previous E3 conventions held in that location.<br />
<br />
The show will be held in July from the 15th to the 17th.
