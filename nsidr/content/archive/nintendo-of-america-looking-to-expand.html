<p>The Seattle Times has the story that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002744300_nintendo17e.html">Nintendo of America is looking to expand</a> its building on its property by 550,000 square feet.</p>

<p>The city of Redmond is looking to work with Nintendo on an agreement concerning this expansion, and would like Nintendo to commit to a pedestrian path through its campus as part of an agreement permitting the expansion.  Redmond also hopes that in the future, such a path could also be used for transit routes.</p>

<p>NOA PR director <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1266">Beth Llewelyn</a> also put in the official line on the project: plans have not yet been completed, and it's too early for the company to discuss specifics.</p>
