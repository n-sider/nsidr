    <p>That night we split up between the rooms (basically giving Ben his own room) and slept our last sleep in Los Angeles. In the morning Cory and Aimee checked out and we had to be out of the hotel by 12:00 noon. Their flight was at 10:00am, but ours wasn't until 10:30pm - we had over ten hours to kill. Luckily, a call to our good friend Mike Quiroz resulted in him taking us on a tour of North Hollywood, the Valley, and everywhere else you'd think to see in a movie somewhere. For that, we are in great debt to him, for showing such awesome hospitality on such short notice. We went to a Frank Lloyd Wright house and we ran into a camera crew for the new National Lampoon movie, Gold Diggers.</p>
    
    <p>We had a few more hours to kill so we went to see Man on Fire. Three hours later it was a mad rush back to Mike's place to get our bags and get to the airport. After thanking Mike, we called a taxi and we were on our way Or so we thought.</p>
    
    <p>Our taxi driver asked us if we could stop quickly before we headed to the airport, we figured for gas, so we agreed. Instead, he stopped on a bridge, took a plastic grocery bag with something in it (Ben says it was shaped like a human head) and threw it over the bridge into the LA River. We asked what it was, and he replied "Religion", needless to say we asked no more questions after that. While we were being driven to the airport, the driver somehow knew we were Canadian and began to ask Ben twenty questions about Canada, because you know, it's not the biggest country in the world or anything like that.</p>

    <p>We got to the airport and had more McDonalds - no super sizing this time. When we got on the plane we basically passed out until we got back to Detroit at 6:00am the next morning. When we left we had to take a shuttle to Detroit, and we had to take the same shuttle back to London, and we were supposed to be booked on the 6:30am one, but apparently we weren't. Two hours later we got on the 8:30 bus and got home around 11:00am. We were all dead tired from exhaustion and malnutrition, and we all went our separate ways to our own beds in our own houses to pass out.</p>
    
    <p>Except for me. I began my 8 day 'experience' of editing the E3 DVD. Everything I had seen in the last week I would get to see again, and again, and again in the span of a few days. Now I sit here, finishing this article so you can read it, and by now you already have - and now I get to sleep, I get to rest knowing that my E3 2004 is complete, finished, over and done with. And to give you the shocking news that there will be no E3 DVD next year, as this one drained me. As much of a success this way, I just can't do it again; it ruined my experiences having to see everything behind a little screen, worrying about changing tapes and watching battery life.</p>
    
    <p>E3 this year was still a blast, new stuff was shown like the DS, PSP and I did have fun. There are many things I haven't mentioned, as I'm either too tired or I want you to see the DVD. The 50 odd of you that did order it, I thank you, as you made the disc more of a success than last year's. The ESPN chicks and BJ Jesus (you'll have to think on that one) are two big DVD-Only features I'm not going to spoil, so you'll have to get the disc. </p>
    
    <p>That's all for this year.</p>
