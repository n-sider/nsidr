    <p>Regaling from the games we played on the floor and the experiences we had, we were eager for day two to start. When it did, we were in for a big surprise.</p>
    
    <p>The show itself, you know, the 8 hours of gaming bliss we got each day was fine. It was what we had to deal with afterwards. Before E3, we set up a SSBM tournament, much like last year. Inviting friends of the site and the core Nintendo sites on the web (N-Philes, GCA, and PGC). We were all to meet after the doors closed outside the media center. We had about 35 people waiting for us. Friends invited friends and other friends tagged along, and we were faced with a dilemma.</p>
    
    <p>It was like that party you went to in high school where everyone was there except the teachers; it got out of hand. We eventually had to cancel the official tournament, but before we could tell anyone GCA had already left for our hotel. We got there to see GCA and PGC (since they're in the same hotel as us) waiting for us outside the hotel. We had invited the N-Philes guys back just to relax, and since everyone was there, the tournament went on as planned unofficially. Instead of 35 people, there were about 15 - a much more reasonable number. An unnamed person from PGC decided to take the longer of the two numbers in our washroom, which made our rooms stink for the entire night - watch the DVD to find out who.</p>

    <p>In the end of the tournament (which took a long time, even with two TVs going) it was Seth Walker of GCA vs. our very own Cory Faller. The games were close, but ultimately Seth won by using Peach. During the whole ordeal we had ordered pizza for everyone and we told stories of E3's past (among other things).</p>
    
    <p>The next morning was very sombre, we all woke up when we wanted to and headed on over to the LACC. The last day of the show gives you a weird feeling. You've seen everything you've wanted to see in the last two days, you're completely and utterly exhausted, but you know that this will be the last time to play any of these games for months, perhaps years on end. So what do you do? You take your time, playing any missed games or replaying games you want to give another shot, or in a lot of our cases, sit down in the Nintendo booth and just watch how tired everyone really is.</p>
    
    <p>Day three we used our media badges to get back into the DS theatre and we relaxed back there for an hour or so playing DS titles, asking for glowing styluses and just being all elite and stuff. I mean, an hour, in the DS theatre, before it opened - that was fun.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the day, everyone was giving away anything lying around - any shirts, toys, props, anything they could get rid of, and Nintendo was no different. Boxes and boxes of DS shirts were piled up against the wall and Nintendo was just handing them out, you could get 20 or 30 shirts if you really wanted - I walked away with about 15. Little did we know, that our very own Josh Langley was mackin' it up backstage with the DS girls, and he walked away with well over 20 glowing DS styluses. When we all got back to the media center with our massive amounts of swag, josh opened his bag and all we saw was blue. Everything was glowing, and my hand grabbed four. Divvied up by some of the staff, we were all happy in the knowledge that we would have backups if ours should ever break or get lost.</p>
    
    <p>As I mentioned before, the entire staff was oblivious to this Reggielution, until the end of the show on Day three, when our very own forums had a topic with that very title, and the images were posted all over - we finally clued in, and since E3, Reggie has gone on to be a cult phenomenon on the Nintendo internet scene.</p>
    
    <p>We waited until everyone got together and started walking back (taking another one of Jason's "shortcuts") we said goodbye to Mike Quiroz from N-Philes and walked back to the hotel. That night, Cory, Aimee, Amanda, Myself, Ben, and Justin went to Grauman's Chinese Theater to go see TROY with the guys from Silicon Knights. Meeting up with them afterwards, we talked of things mostly relating to Eternal Darkness. Denis was kind enough to invite us out to the bars, but since most of us, legal in Canada, were underage in the USA, we had to politely (not wanting to miss this for the world, but had to because we weren't legal in the US) decline.</p>
    
    <p>While trekking back to the hotel, on the subway we heard a bunch of girls yelling at guys behind us to 'get off' with them and that 'she likes you' and, well, it was downright annoying - it's on the DVD too.</p>
    
    <p>That night, Jason, Justin, Josh, Mark, Neale, and Mike all left (well throughout the night anyways), so all that were left was the original five. On Saturday we were going to check out Universal Studios, but it was too expensive for our budgets - we instead, decided to take a subway trip to Little Tokyo, where we found a little bird who had fallen from it's nest and we directed it to safety - after getting some food we took a walk to the Museum of Contemporary Art, and decided to look around in there - they had some really cool displays up, also featured on our DVD. After that we headed back to the hotel, dropped off all our stuff and decided to go back to Hollywood one more time for dinner that night. Aimee, Amanda and I ate at a Sub place and Ben and Cory had a sensual and romantic candlelight dinner at a restaurant in the Hollywood/Highland complex.</p>
    
    <p>On our way back to the hotel, Amanda and I were confronted by this homeless guy asking for 30 cents for a beer, then he proceeded to cough on us and we quickly crossed the street. </p>
