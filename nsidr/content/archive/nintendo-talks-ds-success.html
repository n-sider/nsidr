<p>Nintendo of America put out a few interesting statistics regarding last month's new Super Mario Bros. (titled, oddly enough, <cite><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=876">New Super Mario Bros.</a></cite>) and this past Sunday's launch of the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a>.  Here they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After going on sale May 15, <cite>New Super Mario Bros.</cite> sold at a nonstop rate of roughly one every four seconds nationwide during the reporting period.  It emerged as the No. 1 game of the month, even though it was in stores for just 13 days of the four-week reporting period.<p></li>

<li><p>Two days after Nintendo DS Lite went on sale in the United States on June 11, it has sold more than 136,500 units, with many retail outlets reporting sellouts.  By comparison, DS Lite is outpacing 2003's launch sales of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=23">Game Boy Advance SP</a> by more than 12 percent.</p></li>

<li><p>Major retailers report that sales of <cite>Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day</cite> tripled over the previous week, and <cite>New Super Mario Bros.</cite> sales doubled over the previous week.  (It's worth noting that retail chain Circuit City is currently offering <cite>Brain Age</cite> free with the purchase of a Lite if you've got the right coupon; it's unclear whether those "sales" are counted here.)</p></li>
  </ul>
