<p>Broadcom will supply Nintendo with its wireless Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technologies for the Wii next-generation game console.  The low-latency Bluetooth wireless technology will be used in the Wii remote controller.  One of this technology's key features is said to be its "exceptionally low power consumption."  Meanwhile, the Wii console can also connect to the Internet using Broadcom's BroadRange 54g Wi-Fi solution.  The company states this technology was developed to withstand most radio interference.</p>

<p>"The Wii game console will take advantage of the most popular wireless technologies to deliver an advanced user experience that no other competitive console can match," said <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a>, Senior Managing Director, General Manager, Integrated Research & Development Division for Nintendo. "Broadcom's ability to supply and support custom features for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi has enabled us to provide our customers with a unique gaming experience powered by high-performance, field-proven wireless solutions."</p>
