<p>With <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1635">shortages of Nintendo DS units</a> across Japan set to last throughout January, there's a report via Kotaku that some Japanese stores are <a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/nintendo/japan-importing-american-dses-to-satisfy-consumer-demand-149864.php">reimporting American DS units</a> to satisfy demand.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the pictures show the blue DS model being offered, which is not otherwise available in Japan, so it's also a possibility the importers are simply selling this unique color &mdash; or maybe a combination of both selling points.  Nintendo has said will not honor the American warranties on these units in Japan.</p>
