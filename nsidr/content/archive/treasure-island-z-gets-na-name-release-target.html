<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3204-1.jpg" width="200" height="140" class="image_styled" /></div>Capcom's first original Wii title, previously known under the moniker "Project Treasure Island Z", has been given a title for its eventual release stateside: <i>Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure</i>.<br />
<br />
Half of the titular duo's role is explained in detail: Zack happens upon the talking skull of Barbaros, who promises to get Zack "the world's treasure" in return for help lifting a curse.  Players guide Zack through various environments and stages, solving puzzles and such along the way.  The Wii Remote will be used to rotate handles, turn keys to open doors, play a piccolo, and more.  The remainder of the duo, Wiki, has it even better: he's a <i>flying monkey</i>.<br />
<br />
Zack & Wiki is shooting for a fall release.
