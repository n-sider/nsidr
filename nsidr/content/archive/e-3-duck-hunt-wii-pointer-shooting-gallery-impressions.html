<P>One of the neatest little Wii demos is tucked away on the far right side of the Wii booth after you come into the "kiosk" area.  It is is the Wii pointer shooting demo, and is a wii bit of fun for two players (one of the few two-player installations on the floor).</P>

<p>What it amounts to is a sort of Point Blank type game -- predominantly a type of shooting gallery -- where the two players compete to see who can hit the most objects by moving their on-screen pointer (tied to the position of your Wii controller) and pulling the trigger on the bottom of the remote.  Each player's ammunition is infinite, and there is no penalty for missing shots.</p>

<P>The game passes through several stages.  First there are intermittent balloons that appear and must be shot.  You progress to gun targets, then frisbee-like clay pigeons, and then UFOs.  At the end of each round the two players' scores are shown.  The final round is the doozy, and what many media outlets are mistakenly reporting to be the "new Duck Hunt."  In this game you shoot the Duck Hunt ducks.  More points are obtained if you shoot them as they near the top of the screen and "fly away."  Throughout the game, special colored targets award double or sometimes triple points to the person who shot them.</P>

<P>I played the game once with a booth-lady yesterday, and then with Cory last night during our Nintendo after-hours free-play time.  Each match runs about three minutes.  I have to say, though, that despite it being one of the most simplistic offerings on the floor, it's also one of the most fun and playfully competitive.</P>

<P>It remains to be seen if the game will eventually become a full-fledged title.  Personally, I think little games like this would be great as "bundled" offerings built into the system firmware, or as part of a compilation of other sorts of littler quick titles.</P>

<P>More impressions to come from other N-Sider staffers, and of course our deeper content as the days and the show continue!</P>
