<p>Nintendo of America executive vice president of sales and marketing <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</a> spoke yesterday on Nintendo's strategy going forward.</p>

<p>Fils-Aime focused first on Nintendo's overall strategy of pursuing different markets instead of playing the same game as competitors: "...from a company perspective, you ought to focus on expanding your market boundaries versus singularly being focused on your competition. The thought being, if all you do is focus on your competition, &mdash; imagine it's like sharks in the water, dealing with blood in the water, constantly going at each other. Take a wider view, look at broader opportunities out there in your marketplace."</p>

<p>Fils-Aime backed up these thoughts by discussing market data reflecting a decline in the current market being pursued by Sony and Microsoft in the console space, and a study done by Piper Jaffray indicating gaming becoming less of an interest among teenage males.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in the Q&A, Fils-Aime also mentioned that Nintendo intends to have more partners available for Wi-Fi Connection-enabled hotspots.  "Our partner in this is Wayport. Wayport happens to be in McDonalds. As the site goes live you will see other partners &mdash; J-Wire, for example &mdash; where the system will work. We would love to have as many partners on board as possible."</p>
