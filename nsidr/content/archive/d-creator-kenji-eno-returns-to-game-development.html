<p>Kenji Eno told <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9426">Gamasutra</a> in an interview that he has returned to game development on "a console with a new control device."  Despite the clear hint, he did not go so far as to confirm a Wii title.  Eno is known for his "D" series of cinematic-adventure games for the Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation and Sega Dreamcast.</p>

<p>Eno has been absent from game development for nearly seven years now.  His new studio is called <a href="http://fyto.com/">From Yellow To Orange</a>.  The company's website has only a teaser image with a logo and text that reads "fyto will be on your side..."  Stay tuned for more info.</p>
