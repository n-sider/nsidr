For those unfamiliar with the franchise, it could be most aptly be described as <i>Marble Madness</i> meets... well, meets a little of everything, really. From the press release:</p>

<blockquote><i><b>New Controller Revolutionizes Ways to Have Fun with AiAi and the Super Monkey Ball Gang</b></i>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO & LONDON</b> (April 26, 2006) - SEGA of America, Inc. and SEGA Europe Ltd. today announced <i>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz</i> developed by SEGA Studios for the Nintendo Revolution system. AiAi and all his friends have rolled their way onto Nintendo's new console with new mind-blowing puzzle levels and a wealth of new and exciting Party Games specifically designed to fully exploit the innovative Nintendo Revolution controller. Other titles will have a difficult time matching the multitude of possible variations in game control as presented in <i>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz.</i></p>

<p>"The Nintendo Revolution presents a totally unique avenue for our developers to explore the art of game design," said Scott A. Steinberg, Vice President of Marketing, SEGA of America, Inc. "Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz will present a mind-boggling array of gameplay innovations that will excite and challenge gamers while pushing the boundaries of imagination forward."</p>

<p>The single-player puzzle levels in <i>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz</i> have been innovatively designed to challenge gamers' skills like never before. For the first time in the Super Monkey Ball franchise, AiAi and his friends will have the ability to jump when players flick the Nintendo Revolution controller in an upward motion. The ability to jump has given game designers another dimension in which to expand the Super Monkey Ball gameplay experience and allows gamers a whole new way to interact with the franchise; this time in true three-dimensional fashion.</p>

<p>The Party Games, for which the Super Monkey Ball franchise is famous, return with more variety than ever. An abundance of new Party Games have been creatively designed to take advantage of the Revolution controller in a multitude of ways. Gamers will find themselves competing in a traditional game of ring toss, or even smacking pesky moles in a game of "Whack-a-Mole." <i>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz's</i> large library of Party Games is sure to inspire friendly competition anytime.</p>

<p><i>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz</i> is currently being developed by SEGA Studios. For screenshots and artwork, please visit the SEGA FTP site at: http://segapr.segaamerica.com.</p>
