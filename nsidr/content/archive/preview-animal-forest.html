<b>Animal Forest Plus</b><br>
<font size="1">2001 Nintendo</font>

<p>Nintendo's <i>Animal Forest Plus</i> is an enhanced update to the Nintendo 64 original <i>Animal Forest</i>. This quirky simulation-communication title is a game without real goals or objectives, it's more a game that simulates everyday human life in the form of a cute-lovable "animal forest". Whether it's taking time to redecorate your home, playing a mini-game, or curiosity of what is going to happen on Christmas Day in the Animal Forest Plus, there is a genuine charm and addictiveness that will have you playing the game on a daily basis.

<p><b>Features</b>
<ul>
<li>Digicard can be used to store your character and you can visit other player's forest
<li>Real-time clock tracks and mirrors real-time date and time
<li>Virtual Famicom allows you to play classic NES titles
<li>Dolby Pro Logic Surround Sound
<li>Four players can live per town
<li>Only for Nintendo GameCube
  </ul>


<p>Nintendo's last big Nintendo 64 game came in the form of <i>Animal Forest</i>, a simulation game with communication features that Nintendo wanted to introduce to the masses of gamers craving some new and unique. The project was being handled by legendary Nintendo producer, Takashi Tezuka, Mr. Miyamoto's right hand man on the Zelda and Mario series', and being supervised by Shigeru Miyamoto.

<p><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/animalforest/01.jpg"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/animalforest/01_th.jpg" width="168" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>Nintendo contemplated releasing the game worldwide; the decision was not easy, since the Nintendo 64 version was a hefty 512-megabit cartridge, releasing it on a dying user base was very risky. Still, Takashi Tezuka confirmed the game was indeed being prepared for a world wide release, being the headline title of Nintendo's supposed second-half 2001 line up for the Nintendo 64. Nintendo shortly after decided to abandon ship on the Nintendo 64, and Nintendo and Tezuka decided to give the game another shot on the Nintendo GameCube.

<p><i>Animal Forest</i> is a charming, laid back, game experience. There are no guns, no dungeons to explore, no speedways to race through, just a simple village. Nintendo's simulation game, takes elements from <i>Harvest Moon, Legend of the River King, Shenmue, Zelda</i>, and many other simulation, adventure and RPG games. The game adds innovative communication features as well as charming characters and an endless amount of innovative spins on the aforementioned games.

<p><i>Animal Forest</i> takes place in a village, dubbed (what else) Animal Forest. Things start off by having the player choose a character (over twenty in the N64 version), and getting on the train heading straight to the Animal Forest, where you will embark on a new chapter in your life. Upon getting to the Animal Forest, like all people moving to a new town, your first task is to find a realtor so you can find a place to live in. Upon settling on a home, you waste no time in looking through want ads to find a new job, so you can pay the mortgage to your new home. Finding a job and earning a decent paycheck enables you to buy food, nice clothes, and nice furniture so you can decorate your home. Living on your own, means having responsibilities. You also have to attend to many chores like mowing the lawn, planting flowers, cutting down trees, gathering wood,  and running errands.

<p><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/animalforest/02.jpg"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/animalforest/02_th.jpg" width="160" height="120" border="0" align="right"></a>All work and no play ? Not true at all. In <i>Animal Forest</i> you can do tons of fun things like listen to music, dig for treasure, meet new friends, send and receive letters, post on the town bulletin board, build an orchard or a garden, go to carnivals, collect insects, go hiking and even play the stock market. One of the coolest things you can do, is play classic NES games on your Nintendo system. There are several NES titles hidden away in the game, which you can collect and store in your home. Once in your home, you can pick any game and play it on your NES/Famicom. Some of the confirmed NES titles playable include:

<p>
<b>
<ul>
<li>Balloon Fight</li>
<li>Clu Clu Land</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Jr. Math</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>Pinball</li>
<li>Tennis</li>
  </ul>
</b>
</p>

<p>You can win most of the games during the carnivals held throughout holidays in the Animal Forest.

<p><i>Animal Forest</i> uses the GameCube's built in clock (one had to be build into the cartridge on the Nintendo 64 version) to keep track of the time and the date. Of course, the game will have a day and night setting, and days will progress naturally using the clock. There will also be many holiday and event triggered celebrations depending on the date. For example, on the 4th of July, the whole Animal Forest will be off from work and will celebrate with a fireworks display. There will be many special fairs and holiday celebrations depending on the time and date. The environment, weather, and seasons also change throughout the game. Elements can even change in Animal Forest when you are not playing the game, so it's a good idea to play the game often.

<p>One aspect of the game, pushing the communication features, is that Nintendo promises no two games will be the same. Each game will have its own set of characters, and a distinct looking town. Players can be introduced to each others town via the GameCube digicard, at least four players can move into your town (from other digicards). You can also briefly visit other players towns by simply loading their save and your save together, unless you decide to move in to their town, you will have to leave and say good bye.

<p><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/animalforest/03.jpg"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/previews/animalforest/03_th.jpg" width="168" height="120" border="0" align="left"></a>Though the GameCube incarnation is pretty much an enhancement and remix, Nintendo plans to add many things left out of the N64 version due to time and technical limitations. The graphics and sound will also see major improvements, but realistically, don't expect anything mind blowing. The game's resolution has been bumped up significantly, and more detailed textures and higher polygon counts are detected. However, at this point it still looks like one of the lesser visually-driven GameCube games.The music, which was delightfully reminiscent of the old piano Peanuts (Charlie Brown) theme, will hopefully stay intact.Aesthetics and audio aside, Nintendo will be able to fully exploit <i>Animal Forest</i>'s communication aspects with the GameCube's 56k modem and standard digicards.

<p>Though no official release date has been announced, Nintendo is hoping to release this game by years end in Japan, and early winter in North America. Nintendo hopes the better timing and an overall improved game package will fully introduce <i>Animal Forest</i> a to a larger audience.
