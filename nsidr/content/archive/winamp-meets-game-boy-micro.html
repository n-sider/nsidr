<p>Ever wanted a music player that resembled Nintendo's smallest portable to date? Probably not, but that hasn't stopped a certain <a href="http://www.deviantart.com">deviantART</a>-ist from creating one. Behold -- the Game Boy Micro skin for <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a>!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-04-04-2006-microwinamp.jpg"></p>

<p>Installing the skin is pretty cut-and-dry -- simply download it from <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/view/31214579/">this page</a>  (which also includes a cool illustration of its features), and follow the artist's instructions. He's even gone to the length of adding a "create your own" option that includes 9 color themes and 23 faceplates. Sweet!</p>

<p>Whether you use this skin or not, it'd be nice to drop by the artist's page and leave a comment -- people with this kind of talent and an obvious appreciation for gaming are okay in N-Sider's book.</p> 

<p>When you're done there, <a href="mailto:news@n-sider.com">let us know</a> how it worked out.</p>
