After months of results showing Nintendo DS on top of monthly game hardware sales, July's numbers from sales tracker NPD show a little shuffle at the top&mdash;Wii has now moved out of second place and into first.   Nintendo themselves are quick to note that this success comes in spite of pricing shifts by their competitors.<br />
<br />
In software, a slightly different tale is being told; Nintendo platforms only claim three of the top ten spots with <i>Wii Play</i> at #3, <i>Mario Party 8</i> at #5, and <i>Pok&eacute;mon Diamond</i> at #7.  Appearing in the non-Nintendo slots is stiff competition from multiplatform franchises NCAA Football and Guitar Hero, while Nintendo platform releases for this summer have been rather slow.  Nintendo notes in defense that for the year, they've got six of the top 10 spots locked, including the top three with the DS Pok&eacute;mon installments holding #1 with Diamond and #3 with Pearl, and Wii Play in the #2 position.<br />
<br />
Nintendo releases are ramping up again this month with <i>Brain Age 2</i> for Nintendo DS already released (including a limited-edition bundle) and <i>Metroid Prime: Corruption</i> for Wii next week; next month's results should be interesting indeed.
