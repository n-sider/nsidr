<p>The Nintendo DS handheld will be used as a spy gadget in the upcoming motion picture Stormbreaker.  <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1134"  style="color: #336699; text-decoration: none;">George Harrison</a>, Nintendo of America's senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications, is quick to explain tongue-in-cheek, "...while the Nintendo DS is one of the most versatile gaming systems available, we unfortunately have no plans to make any DS spy-related functions available to the general public."</p>  

<p>Stormbreaker is based on the first in the popular Alex Rider series of books by Anthony Horowitz, which have sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.  After the murder of his uncle and guardian, the MI6 British spy agency recruits the reluctant 14-year-old Alex Rider to take over his uncle's mission. Like any good spy, during training he receives his key piece of gadgetry: a Hot Rod Red Nintendo DS. He also gets several game cards that transform his DS into an eavesdropping device, a wiretap detector or a smoke bomb. Stormbreaker is scheduled for release in the United Kingdom on July 21 and in the United States on October 6.</p>
