<h2>Sams Club Edition of Super Mario Sunshine Too Large for GameCube</h2>

<p>(Branson, MISSOURI) -- Many Sam's Club patrons expressed shock and dismay recently over the newly released Sam's Club edition of popular GameCube title "Super Mario Sunshine."</p>

<p>Measuring nearly sixty inches in diameter and a massive five inches thick, the disc that comes in the modified game packaging is slightly larger than the GameCube's three-inch-wide disc drive will allow.</p>

<p>"I just thought the huge box and ridiculous weight were for show," said shopper Tammy Wilson. "Did they really expect anyone to be able to play this? I'm starting to think there's not even a game on there at all."</p>

<p>The bright blue game disc gives the game package a weight of over eighty pounds, resulting in absolute destruction of any GameCube that ends up below the disc, but this hasn't stopped many gamers from attempting to find ways around this size limitation.</p>

<p>"Some friends of mine worked with me to rig up a way to play the disc," said gamer Eric Parks. "We took an industrial spool and an old lawn mower engine and were able to spin the disc at about 5 RPM before the disc shattered, spilling blue liquid everywhere. It looked kind of like Kool-Aid."</p>

<p>"I think it's a horrible move on Nintendo's part," said one mother of three. "We bought Jimmy this game for Christmas but thought maybe something was suspicious about it while we were bringing it out to the car. Are GameCube games supposed to weigh eighty pounds? I mean, that's more than Jimmy!" But this didn't stop her from trying to make it work for her game-deprived son. "Oh, yeah, we tried to get it working anyway, but pretty much all we could do with it was put it in the yard. It looks sort of neat out there."</p>

<p>Reportedly, the Sam's Club edition of "Super Mario Sunshine" contains the exact same game code as the normal-sized, retail edition.</p>
