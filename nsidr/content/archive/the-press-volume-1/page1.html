<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/thepress-1020-alkoopa.gif" width="150" height="161" align="left" hspace="5" /><p style="text-align: justify">Hundreds are shortened after a fierce shell attack at a crowded Mushroom Kingdom mall this afternoon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In a statement posted on their website, the Al-Koopa terrorist network claimed responsibility for the strike, citing that the innocent shoppers were "infidels," and that "shopping for various suits and power-ups to destroy the Koopa race [was] despicable."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">This is the third such attack in as many levels, coming just off the heels of the recent Mushroom Kingdom occupation of the Koopa Kingdom made possible by the rapid, record time defeat of King Koopa at the hands of Mario, which many critics claim left many enemies undefeated.</p>

<h3>SAM'S CLUB EDITION OF SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE TOO LARGE FOR GAMECUBE</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">Many Sam's Club patrons expressed shock and dismay recently over the newly released Sam's Club edition of popular GameCube title "Super Mario Sunshine."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Measuring nearly sixty inches in diameter and a massive five inches thick, the disc that comes in the modified game packaging is slightly larger than the GameCube's three-inch-wide disc drive will allow.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">"I just thought the huge box and ridiculous weight were for show," said shopper Tammy Wilson. "Did they really expect anyone to be able to play this? I'm starting to think there's not even a game on there at all."</p>
