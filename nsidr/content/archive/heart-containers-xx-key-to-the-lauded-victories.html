<h3>[06.12] XX - Key to the Lauded Victories</h3><P>What follows is a collection of letters 

received between the dates of March 13 and May 27 -- surely this wide spread is a testament to 

the column's outstanding appeal!  In fact, I could almost take us in a quarterly direction.  If 

one column every three months is what it takes to culture a frothy and ravenous appetite for 

Heart Containers within all of you, indubitably it can be done.  But I would like to make it 

clear that any adherence to any sort of schedule is purely a coincidence from this point 

henceforth.  And hitherto actually.</P>

<P>Last week I asked you all to send in letters and tell me what your favorite episode of the 

venerable Heart Containers has been throughout its twenty-issue run.  Who could have possibly 

imagined that when I joined the N-Sider crew almost exactly two years ago to the day, that I'd 

one day be the most proliferous producer of defammatory content on the site and a co-creator of 

the milestone news publication, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/the-press-volume-2">The Press</a>?  Not I, faithful 

readers, not I.  But you responded!  Some of you wrote in to tell me about your favorite 

issues, some of you wrote in to tell me about your dream Smash Brothers character (WHICH YOU 

MISSED THE BOAT ON JERKS THAT WAS LAST TIME), some of you wrote in to tell me things that had 

nothing to do with absolutely anything, and some of you were Matthew Newhart, who sent me this 

foreboding and observant reflection:</P>

<P><b>Your really wierd you crap head</b></P>

<P>Please don't look at the animals.  They have been sheltered from society.  No flash 

photography.  Sir!  SIR!  DO NOT PHOTOGRAPH MISTER NEWHAR---</P>

<P>I was getting set to write you my awesome idea of putting Crash Bandicoot and Lara Croft in 

the next Smash Brothers game, when all of a sudden I noticed that you updated your column! 

What's worse, is that it was more or less on time!</P>
 
<P>Brandon, this is just not acceptable.</P>
 
<P>Us fans of heart containers don't have time to sit around and actually write you amusing 

letters once a week! We've got things to do! For example, I spent my week IMing you to complain 

that you wern't updating your column enough. So if that isn't example enough of the 

responsiblity your readers are forced to shoulder, I have no idea what is.</P>
 
<P>Regardless, you asked for my favorite letter/column of Hearts Containers, and thus I will 

oblige. So far, I'd have to say I'm rather attached to this one:</P>

had to offer. Also, USA #1 4 evar.</P>

<b>The Heart Containers Staff says:</b> <P>Dear Alan,</P>

<P>As you may know, the deadline for Smash Brothers idea submission has passed, and you were 

too slow.  We understand your devotion to the cause, and do not wish to leave you unrewarded, 

however.  As a treat, so you would not miss the opportunity to write in regarding this topic, 

we have delayed the column for three months.  We hope this deadline extension pleased you.</P>

<P>We also offer you this consolation prize.  It is in the mail.</P>

<P>Your picture is good.  I like it.  Perhaps in the next installment of Smash Brothers, we

<P>The question remains, however:  If we stand there and stare at him for a couple hundred 

seconds, will he flash colors and fly away from the stage?  I think the answer is yes.</P>

    <td bgcolor="lightgrey"><P>Dear mr, Brandon I've been reading your column for
quite some time now but for some
unknown reason I never sent you a letter. I've notice
you've been short of letters as of late
so I decided to finally write you one. I've been
reading and enjoying your witty remarks
for months now, in fact your column is one of the only
things in life that make me forget 
about my severe case of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia
that makes me inebriated with rage!
schizophrenia that makes me feel a deity's strength!
schizophrenia that makes me want to burn things!
to pillage houses! and most of all to KILL! KILL!
KILL! </P>
<P>Well, any way here's a picture of a cute kitty.</P>
<P><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/hearts20kitty.jpg"></center></p>

 

<p>At least I think it's a kitty. 
I've also noticed that I'm not the only one who's been
influenced by you.
Why, just a couple of weeks ago I've read a Paul
McCartney interview. And I quote "People often say
that
John wrote The Walrus when he was under the influence
of LSD, you know. But in fact, you know, it was one
night in 1965
when we noticed a smoking machine in the horizon, we
also noticed a silhouetted figure shaped like a Walrus
so we approached it, and 
all the way through the trail we heard this loud
obnoxious voice, you know, screaming GOO GOO GOO JOOB.
It turn out that it was in fact
a man on fire screaming for help, so we poured some
water on him, you know, then he mummbled something
about him inventing a Time Machine, you know, and that
it was the first time he'd tested it. So we got to
talking and he gave us some 
oddly shaped cigarettes. He also mention his name I
think, brand daik something or other." concrete
evidence that it was not Bob Dylan
who gave The Beatles some smoking fairies, but it was
you dear Mr. Brandon who gave them the FlyingDragon
smokes and influenced the outburst of brilliance 
that is The Beatles.</P>

<P>I've also heard that you and your colleague "Smith"
are working on "The Press 2". May I be so bold to
suggest some ideas;</P>

<P>-Idea no.1; a before they where stars section in which
you'll write about Link's long time struggle with
anorexia, (I'm not saying he's anorexic, but if he'll
hide 
behind a sign-post he'll disappear) the reason for
Kirby's appetite (He puffs a little to much, if you
know what I mean) and of course Mario's connection
with a certain nonchalant "disposal company."</P>

<P>-Idea no.2; I actually don't have a second idea, but
you have to admit the first one isn't bad.</P>

<P>Enough yap. You asked for my personal favorite Heart
Container letter/column. After long consideration
(lasting a exactly 27 and half seconds) I've decided
that my 
favorite letter is the one in the 12th installment,
when some guy send you a letter consisting a billion
words and you just summerized it by showing pictures
of the things 
he wrote about. I like to call it "My toilet is
broken" (I have my reasons) 
As for my favorite installment is the 14th one. Why?
because it was long with in your face replys, such as;
the one when some guy sent you a letter with some 
bad internet spelling, such as; "Warez spelling" or as
I like to call it "Stupid Flaming Goat spelling" lol.
(get the pun, lol) 
I like to call that one;  "A laugh, a chuckle and a
letter with wacky consequences."</P>

<P>P.S. There's a bunch banners on top of the site that
been mocking me with their beauty for months now. I
hope to be an illustrator myself someday and it will
mean a lot to me
if you or one of the N-Sider staffer could make them
these beautiful fan-works into wallpapers? (Preferably
sized 1024X780.) so me and the rest of the people 
who often visit and dwell the site could decorate our
desktop with them and enjoy them more thoroughly. And
also the name of the person who drew them. Thank you.</P>

<P>P.P.S.  I was just kidding about the McCartney thing.
We all know you lack the funds to purchase some
plutonium that's needed for a Time Machine.</P>

<P>P.P.P.S. I forgot mention Nintendo, so Nintendo...
they're great.</P>

<p>P.P.P.P.S. Well, that's an hour of my life I'll never
get back.</P>    </TD>

<P>I mean, seriously.  Can't you think of anything better?  I know there
are more than 19 video game related questions you could ask your
adoring readers.  What should nintendo do next?  If you could design a
dream system, what would it be like? INCLUDE PICTURES, etc.  Design
the next nintendo hero's uniform, or design the next hero.</P>

<P>You are the reason my column exists, guy.  I could spend lines pointing your grammatical and 

punctuation errors out.  For instance, it is not on a regular basis that people add 550 

exclamation points to the end of a phrase.  Yes, there's really that many there.  I bet you 

feel bad now, huh?  In addition, "your" should not be used when you mean "you are" and "wan't" 

is not a contraction, nor is "wierd" actually a word.</P>

Don't bail this time, okay!  I promise to keep reading as long as you

<P>Because I haven't been reading for long, it wouldn't be fair to give
an all-time fav.  If I had to say, it would be the one by Alan.

<P>I hope you share a favorite.  It's this one, right?</P>

<P>Hi, Brandon.  I've always thought that people who send in two letters
kind of suck.  So please pardon this--my second letter.  On the other
hand, you haven't updated the column in a long time, so we're even.</P>

<P>I read some of your past columns and still don't have a favorite
letter.  Sorry.  I do have a favorite closing comment, though.  It's
in Heart Containers IX.  You only got two letters in that edition. 
Two.  So, you gave some heartfelt closing comments and returned in
less than a week.  What did you find then?  So many letters, you
almost had to use a hyphen to write out the number in proper English. 
My conclusion:  A good closing comment yields a gain in letters.</P>

Good thing, too, because I have AN AMAZING DEAL for you Heart Containers readers.</P>

<P>Here it is.  Everyone reading this needs to send me a letter for next time, one that is ON 

TOPIC.  Of all the letters I receive, I will randomly select one winner to e-mail back.  If you 

receive this e-mail from me, CONGRATULATIONS!  YOU'RE A WINNER!  The winner will get a very

will not discriminate on quality.  Just send me a letter that in some way pertains to the 

topic, and you're eligible.</P>

<P>For next week, you need to e-mail me and tell me about a fictional game that would never be 

made if it was presented to the Nintendo people who figure out whether or not to make a game.  

Kirby's Adventure in Bile?  Super Mario: Vice City?  Perhaps even Super Metroid X-Treme Beach
