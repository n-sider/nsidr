<p>During its investor meeting in Japan this week, Nintendo engineer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</a> said, "You'll be able to play [the Revolution] not just by linking up to a television but to a computer monitor as well." 

<p>Also amid speculation about the Revolution's features, Nintendo president <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> said, "We have no intention of making a two screen console akin to the DS."</p>
