What would possess a sane person to sing a JigglyPuff inspired rendition on FOX Network's American Idol television show? This man is either genius or has a few tuffs of hair loose.  You decide.  Check out the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=jogPtEBHitY">here</a>, courtesy of YouTube.com.<br><br>

On an unrelated note, also check out this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/?v=6UAmSctWtQk">Nintendo commercial</a> from 2004.  Some of you will likely recognize it.  Next to the original Super Smash Bros. Nintendo 64 television commercial, this is one of my favorites.
