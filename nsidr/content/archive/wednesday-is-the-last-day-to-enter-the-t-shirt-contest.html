So how do you win? It's easy. We're throwing caution to the wind and in celebration of the return to school and end of summer, we're making this a Wet Geek T-Shirt contest.<br><br>

Yes, you read right; Wet T-Shirt contest. Now, don't go thinking we're all perverts here.  (It's really more like 50/50.) All of the entries have to be <b>work safe</b> and involve a T-Shirt being wet in some form. You don't even have to be wearing it, just as long as it's funny and there's a T-Shirt soaked with water somewhere in the photo. And just to prove that it's really you, there's gotta be some mention of N-Sider.com in the photograph.<br><br>

You've got until midnight on October 4, 2006, to submit your photo (we'll only take your first submission, so make it count!) to <a href="mailto:contests@n-sider.com">contests@n-sider.com</a> and we'll choose the winners based on a staff vote.<br><br>

The criteria is simple, the task should be entertaining, and the funniest three will win the shirts. The person with the most votes will get first pick of the three shirts shown above, and so on.<br><br>

We'd also like to remind you that you can sign up for SplitReason's newsletter, where you can receive periodical updates on new shirts and products. Please note this newsletter is maintained by SplitReason.com, and it is completely optional to join.<br><br>

So start taking pictures, and go get wet!  Please copy and paste the following in your email entry, in addition to attaching your photo:<br><br>
