<p>Club Nintendo, Nintendo's Official Spanish Magazine, conducted an interview with The Legend of Zelda director <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=6">Eiji Aonuma</a>.  The interview was translated by GCAdvanced.  An excerpt is below:</p>

<blockquote>
<font size="2">
<p><b>CN: We have received several emails in which our readers ask: Will Zelda and Link ever be involved [romantically]? [laughs] I'm sorry, but we had to ask.</b></p> 

<p>EA: [laughs] Good question. Well, as you already know, we are now dealing with a teenage Link, and as you know, teenagers are very emotional beings, so there are definitely possibilities of seeing Link showing his feelings towards the princess. But honestly, we don't know what the future holds.</p> 

<p><b>CN: Any Zelda game for the DS planned?</b></p> 

<p>EA: The Zelda team is already planning Four Swords for the Nintendo DS. This game will have a lot of connectivity and feature a lot of interaction between both screens. It will be interesting.</p>
