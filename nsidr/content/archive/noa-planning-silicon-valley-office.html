The San Jose Mercury News is reporting that Nintendo of America <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_6093809">is planning to open</a> an office in Silicon Valley, satisfying the West Coast part of their <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2742">sales staff relocation</a>.<br />
<br />
The Redmond, Washington-based NOA's announcement comes in response to the success of the DS and Wii. 55 key jobs in sales and marketing are planned to be moved to the new office in the "Redwood City, Menlo Park, San Carlos" area at the end of September. At the same time, 25 employees will make the move to Manhattan.<br />
<br />
Reggie Fils-Aime, president of NOA, said that these moves are an effort to be closer to the Bay Area's technology trends and New York's media influence. "In our minds, it's essential to spend physical time with people from other companies, to be involved with them as neighbors and do business with them face to face."<br />
<br />
A large amount of large independent developers are located in Silicon Valley, including EA, while also housing offices for large technology companies such as Intel and Cisco Systems.
