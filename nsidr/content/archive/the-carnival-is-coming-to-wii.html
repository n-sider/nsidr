Do carnies give you nightmares? Well, how about carnies in yet another minigame collection for Wii?  Global Star Software is <a href="http://www.globalstarsoftware.com/news/36.shtml">delivering a one-two punch</a> for both causes with <i>Carnival Games</i>, developed by Take-Two studio Cat Daddy Games.<br />
<br />
Vice President of Publishing for Global Star Software Steve Lux says the title "was built from the ground up to take full advantage of the capabilities of the Wii Remote." Up to four players will compete in over 25 different carnival games, with all the popular favorites such as Alley Ball, Clown Splash, Dunk Tank, and Test of Strength&mdash;the latter playable by swinging the Wii Remote like a hammer. Over 250 prizes can be won ranging from goldfish to stuffed animals, and players will be able to customize their character by winning games.<br />
<br />
Carnival Games will be premiering along with many other titles at Nintendo's Media Summit today and tomorrow in Seattle, and a trailer is currently available at <a href="http://www.globalstarsoftware.com/carnivalgames/">the game's website</a>. It is not yet rated, and expected to retail for $39.99 this summer. Global Star Software is a publishing label of Take-Two Interactive Software.
