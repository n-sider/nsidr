<p>Namco Bandai is showcasing Final Furlong for the Nintendo Wii. The game is said to be similar to the arcade horse-racing title of the same name. Using the nunchuk and Wii remote, players grab the reigns of a horse and encourage the animal to gallop with an up and down motion.  Pulling back will slow the horse down.  Players can also whip the horse for extra speed using the B button.  The title is scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
