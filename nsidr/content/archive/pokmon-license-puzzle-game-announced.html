<p>Nintendo has will be bringing <i>Pokmon Trozei</i> -- yet another Pokmon-license game for the system that has yet to see a real Pokmon game -- to the Nintendo DS on March 6, 2006.</p>

<p>In <i>Trozei</i>, players slide pieces in all four directions to line them up and make them disappear before the pieces stack to the top of the playfield, which spans both screens.  Players can also chain rows (called "trozeis") for bonus points.</p>

<p>The game justifies its use of the Pokmon license by having puzzle pieces resembling 380 different Pokmon and allowing players to "collect" the Pokmon appearing in their matches.  Some Pokmon are rare and may appear more frequently after engaging in wireless play.</p>

<p><i>Trozei</i> has two single-player modes as well as a wireless battle mode for two players.  <i>Trozei</i> can also send a "Pokmon Trozei Mini" demo version of itself to Nintendo DS units in Download Play mode.</p>
