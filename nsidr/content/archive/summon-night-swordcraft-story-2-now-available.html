<div class="box"><b><a href="http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/summon-night-2/737074p1.html" target="_blank">GameSpy</a> says</b> (3.5/5),<br />
"Though it manages to be a better game than its predecessor, Summon Night 2 isn't a must-have title. On the other hand, with the sparse amount of games coming out for the GBA nowadays, it's safe to say that this is one of the better titles you'll find in stores. The game has what it takes to satiate the average RPG fan, with an engaging (if not by the numbers) story, fast-paced battles and entertaining gameplay devices that provide enough to appeal to a broad audience. If nothing else, it's like a vanilla shake: nothing new, but still satisfying."</div><br />
