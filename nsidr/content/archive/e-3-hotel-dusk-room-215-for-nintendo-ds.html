<p><ul>
<li>Los Angeles, 1979. Players take the role of Kyle Hyde, an ex-cop turned salesman trying
to track down a missing friend. Clues lead to an eerie, old hotel rumored to have one very
strange room - a room where wishes are granted. Players check in and get ready for a
night of surprises as they meet a cast of unusual characters and try to unravel the mystery
in Hotel Dusk: Room 215, a gritty new graphic adventure for the Nintendo DS.
<li>Players hold their Nintendo DS like a book and use the touch screen to grill
characters, search for clues and solve mystifying puzzles.
<li>Players follow the plot twists and turns as they hunt for their missing friend and
investigate the mysteries of Hotel Dusk.
Special powers/weapons/moves/features: The DS system is held like a book, which
allows characters on the screens to face left or right for more realistic conversations. The
unique controls let even novices enjoy themselves. The unique hand-drawn character
portraits and their animations are in black and white, making them exceedingly
distinctive and able stand out, graphically speaking, from the rest of the game. In the
tradition of Trace Memory, the use of the DS to solve riddles is alive and well in Hotel
Dusk: Room 215.
