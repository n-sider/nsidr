<div class="box">Once we're done with the main quest, what sorts of things can we expect to be able to do?  For example, like <i>Rune Factory 2</i>'s underground shrines and boss rematches, as well as the ability to keep farming and work on rare crops.</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Hashimoto:</span>We made sure that there is plenty to do in this game, too. Once the main quest is over, that doesn't mean the game is over so you can rest assured in that respect.  There are users who like to progress the main quest while others would just like to expand their fields.  This allows each and every user to play this game however they want.  Aside from the open-ended gameplay, there are also many quests that can be received so I encourage everyone to try out everything that's available.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">One of the things I particularly liked about the DS games was the look of the world; in contrast to many 2-D games which look assembled from small pieces repeated over and over, every place in the DS games looked unique and drawn as a whole.  Did you seek to reproduce this look in <i>Frontier</i>, and if so, how did you go about doing it?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Hashimoto:</span>In the Rune Factory series, we try to make the game map similar to how it may appear in the real world.  We try to make it so the visual (screen display) will link to your memory to remember where you're at. For example, "There's a sign board here which means the place I want to go to is right around the corner." This is easy to say, but it was something our designer put a lot of detail into so that's what made it possible.</div></div><br />

<div class="box">What is the flying whale island all about?  I think it's really become the game's trademark in our minds.</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Hashimoto:</span>We tried adding this in because the previous 2 handheld versions were as if the player was looking down upon the world.  We wanted something where you could look up as if the entire world was just an island.<br />
<br />
Since this world is a very peaceful place, we wanted more than just having a floating island.  That's how the idea of making it a whale came about.<br />
<br />
We had talked about there being a floating island in the beginning, but it was another staff member that suggested it look like a whale.  In retrospect, I believe it gave the world much more depth.</div></div><br />
<div class="box">What does the future of the Rune Factory series look like?  Will there be more interesting changes to the formula, going forward?  Do you see it lasting as long as Harvest Moon has?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Hashimoto:</span>I think that will be up to the readers of this interview.  I want to continue working on it and create even more fun things.  If you buy our game, it will certainly lead to more, so please purchase it!  I already have some new concepts for the system and I believe it will be very fun.  I'm just waiting for a good opportunity to use it.</div></div><br />

<div class="box">Any final comments?</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Hashimoto:</span><i>Rune Factory</i> started off as a handheld game and is now on a home console.  This was only possible due to all the support we received from the fans.  I'm very thankful to have this opportunity to express my thanks to everyone.<br />
<br />
Thank you and please play the game if you get the chance to.<br />
<br />
It's fun, but there are also dangers that await you.<br />
<br />
That's what it means to live in a fantasy world, so please enjoy life inside this world!</div></div><br />
<div class="box">Thank you for your time, and best of luck with <i>Frontier</i> and in all your endeavors!</div><div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Hashimoto:</span>Thank you very much.</div></div><br />
<i>Rune Factory Frontier</i> is just around the corner, with a slated release date of March 17.  If the unique combination of farming and fighting wrapped up in a ton of content that will keep you going for many, many hours sounds like it just might tickle your fancy, I recommend you give it a spin.
