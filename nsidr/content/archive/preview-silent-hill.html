<h3>Silent Hill</h3>
The original <i>Silent Hill</i> game on the PlayStation was an exciting survivor horror similar to Capcom's popular <i>Resident Evil</i> series. When <i>Silent Hill</i> was announced for the Game Boy Advance, a game similar to the original was expected. Instead, what was playable at Spaceworld 2000 was a text-based adventure with an interactive story.

The main character, Harry Mason, is searching for his missing daughter Sheryl in the resort town of Silent Hill. During his search, Harry encounters monsterous zombies and bizarre mysteries. He also meets the police officer Cybil Bennet who patrols near the town. The game features a lot of text, and the player is asked to do several path choices that will affect the story and possibly the ending.

<i>Silent Hill</i> is packed with impressive computer-generated images and short FMV sequences that seem to be ripped out of the original game. While the GBA game will surely leave many fans of the original scratching their heads as the game play is more or less non-existant, <i>Silent Hill</i> could very well be an intriguing adventure when it gets released at the GBA launch next year.
