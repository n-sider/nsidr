<P>The Earthbound freaks over at <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/?t=msg&th=17861">Starmen.net</a>'s forums are reporting, via a translation of new comments on Earthbound mastermind Shigesato Itoi's <a href="http://www.1101.com">homepage</a>, that Mother 3 for the Gameboy Advance is allegedly "nearing release."  From the translation:</P>

<P><i>"After some discussion with Nintendo, I've decided to make a slightly head-start announcement here on [my webpage].  I've worried people quite a bit this whole time, but I'm happy to report that Mother 3 for Game Boy Advance is nearing release.</P>
<P>It looks like its release date will be about one season away, and I'm in the middle of doing many work retreats to get it finished. I'm going to work especially hard for a short while longer to get everything done.</P>
<P>I'm sure I'll receive all sorts of questions, but I'm probably going to stay quiet about Mother 3 until just before its release. I know the importance of publicity, but what I feel is that I want players to REALLY enjoy Mother 3. So until just before the game comes out, I'm going to remain as quiet as possible."</i></P>

<P>We'll bring you more as we get it, and then, when it's announced for an English release, I will crack open my co-workers' heads and feast on the goo inside.</P>
