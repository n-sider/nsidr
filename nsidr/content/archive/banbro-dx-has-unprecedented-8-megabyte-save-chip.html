The mandate to store 100 user compositions and 100 downloadable songs in <i>Daigasso! Band Brothers DX</i> brings a heretofore unseen enhancement to the game: an <i>8 megabyte</i> save chip.<br />
<br />
Contrary to <a href="http://www.dsfanboy.com/2008/06/26/nintendo-delays-daigasso-band-brothers-bootlegging/">reports</a> that have surfaced since the game debuted, sources in the Japanese homebrew community have reported the new chip isn't just 8 megabits (1 megabyte), but a full 64 megabits, or 8 megabytes.  The chip in question is a <a href="http://www.chipdocs.com/datasheets/datasheet-pdf/SGSThomson-Microelectronics/M25P64.html">ST M25P64</a>, and is sixteen times a big as the previously largest save chip, which permitted games to save up to 512 kilobytes of data and was seen in games like <i>The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</i>.<br />
<br />
If the new chip appears in other games, it could herald levels of customizability.  In the meantime, as DS Fanboy reported, it's certainly helping to keep pirates at bay.
