<p>GameDaily has recently put up some predictions for the upcoming next generation, and they're pretty confident <a href="http://revolution.gamedaily.com/game/features/?gameid=2354&id=991">Nintendo's Revolution spells a "return to glory"</a> for the venerable company.</p>

<p>GameDaily cites three key factors for their prediction of success: the huge pool of Nintendo, Sega, and TurboGrafx games to pull from for the Virtual Console, which can play off Japan's ongoing obsession with classic Nintendo IP to build a large installed base and therefore influence Japanese developers to create titles for the console; the unique controller, which can create both more-accessible and more-fun games for the console than can be found on Revolution's traditionally-controlled competitors; and of course the persistent rumor that Revolution will be $200 or less.</p>

<p>We'll have to see how this all plays out, to be sure.  One thing is certain: this is going to be one interesting generation.</p>
