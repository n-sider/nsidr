<H3>Doshin the Giant</H3>

<p><b>Doshins star is rising thanks to Nintendos decision to localize this gargantuan title for Europe. It remains to be seen whether or not it will be able to find a place in European peoples hearts  after all, it is one of those quirky Japanese titles.</b>
<p>Doshin is one of the many giants that are mentioned in ancient legends of the four tribes on the Barudo islands. This friendly yellow guy has offered his help to the community, and as the player you can build houses, plant trees or just sit back and relax, watching days pass by as the lives of the little people go on. One thing that you <i>have</i> to do, however, is make sure that the Barudo tribes build 16 monuments to worship giants like Doshin. You can help the little guys by lowering the land or creating a hill to bring two tribes together. If youre lucky, both of them will want to cooperate in building a monument so Doshin will be able to absorb the loving emotions (red hearts) by which the giant can grow bigger and bigger. When you have enough of playing Mr Nice Guy, you can always switch to play Jashin, the evil and red incarnation of Doshin. This giant with a bad temper likes to terrorize the tribes on the islands, and can do anything from crushing houses to killing the inhabitants of the Barudo islands by burning them. By collecting hateful emotions (skulls) Jashin can get more powerful. As Jashin, tribes will also build monuments for you, depending on whether they choose to be friendly or evil.
<p>Whatever you choose to do, make sure you make the right decision at the right time, because more than anything else, Doshin the Giant is a strategic game. Unfortunately, just like in the real world, disasters are waiting to happen. Typhoons, vulcanos and other natural elements have the power to singlehandedly destroy a whole village.
<p>Doshin the Giant looks to be a real winner. The game is charming in its own unique way, and in my short playing time I had more fun with this title than I ever had with Peter Molyneuxs Black and White. Europeans and importers, look out for this massively enjoyable title in September.
