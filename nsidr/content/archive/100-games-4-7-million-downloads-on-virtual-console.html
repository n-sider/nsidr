Nintendo announced this morning that, with the upcoming June 4 addition of <i>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</i> to the Virtual Console service on the Wii Shop Channel, there will officially be 100 titles available on the service.<br />
<br />
Collectively, since launching November 19, Virtual Console titles have been downloaded 4.7 million times.  The top five downloaded titles on the service are as follows:<br />
<br />
<ol>
  <li><i>Super Mario Bros.</i> (NES)</li>
  <li><i>Super Mario 64</i> (Nintendo 64)</li>
  <li><i>Mario Kart 64</i> (Nintendo 64)</li>
  <li><i>Super Mario World</i> (SNES)</li>
  <li><i>The Legend of Zelda</i> (NES)</li>
</ol><br />
Virtual Console titles on the Wii Shop Channel are virtually "sold" in exchange for Wii Points, which are available at the rate of about $1 for 100.  Downloads are tied to specific Wii consoles, and can currently only be moved to new consoles if the console is being exchanged as part of a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2638">authorized repair</a>.  Nintendo of America generally releases two or three new old titles on the Virtual Console every Monday.<br />

Nintendo says nearly 40% of all Wii consoles sold have been connected to the Internet.  The Wii Shop Channel isn't limited to the Virtual Console; its Wii Ware section is also home to a tiny handful of original content such as the <i>Internet Channel</i> and the <i>Everybody Votes Channel</i>.  Signs point to a big expansion in Wii Ware content on the way, with several publishers hinting at plans to distribute original games this way, including <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2735">confirmed titles from System 3</a>.
