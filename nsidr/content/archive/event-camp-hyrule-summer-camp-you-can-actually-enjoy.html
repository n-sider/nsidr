<p>Nintendo is once again hosting Camp Hyrule, which is sponsored by Nintendo Power. Campers can register at <a href="http://www.camphyrule.com/index.jsp?cppProfile=y05hT0nFQsqK7wN_-GVB8kGdSZuq5oLO&cppChecked=1">www.Camp Hyrule.com</a>. Registration ends at 5 PM PST on July 28th.</p>

<p>One of the first virtual communities to bring video gamers together for discussion and events of like interest, Camp Hyrule has continued to increase in popularity in each of its 11 years. Once camp begins, each registered camper will be assigned a virtual cabin where they can interact with their fellow "bunkmates" and meet other gamers in exclusive Camp Hyrule chat rooms and message boards. Campers even have a chance to interact with Nintendo's game-play experts, who will join the campers in their chat rooms from time to time.</p>

<p>The type of events campers can expect are: chat shows with VIP guests, games, art activities, and a ton of suprises from the Nintendo universe. This year, campers can expect to participate in activites based on upcoming Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance games like The <i>Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Nintendogs, Mario Kart DS, Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness</i> and many more.</p>

<p>Nintendo expects 10,000 to 15,000 campers to join in the festivities, which takes place from Aug. 15 to Aug. 19.</p>
