<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2372">invitations to a New York press event</a> to be held September 14, where NOA intends to hold a media hands-on session with DS and Wii, comes news that a similar press event <a href="http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_noticia.php?id=cw44f46aca021ab&pic=GEN">will be held in Europe</a> on September 15.</p>

<p>It looks like the pieces of the puzzle may be falling into place for Nintendo's much-anticipated announcements of Wii release information&mdash;though, of course, nothing to that end has been confirmed to be happening at these events.  All we know is that Nintendo has committed to announcing this information <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2276">in September</a>.  Time will tell.  Stay tuned.</p>
