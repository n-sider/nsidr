No sooner had I finished posting the "rumor" link in the sidebar over there when the press release went up, confirming all the overnight chatter: Nintendo DSi is coming to the U.S. on April 5 for $170.  Interestingly, it's not shipping in white, either: you'll be able to get it in black or blue.<br />

Nintendo DSi is officially the next entry in the juggernaut Nintendo DS line, boasting new features such as a downloadable software service (DSiWare), internal storage, an SD card slot, and two built-in cameras. Under the hood, though, it <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/what-we-think-we-know-about-the-dsi">appears to be much more</a>, likely sporting a dual-sped CPU, improved sound capabilities, and a secondary Wi-Fi chip&mdash;it seems to be sort of like Wii is to GameCube, actually, running existing DS games in "compatibility mode" while new DSi games get access to the hardware improvements.  Nintendo also confirmed today that DSi-specific game cards will grace shelves someday.<br />
<br />
Alongside the DSi, Nintendo will also be releasing 1.6-million-seller <i>Rhythm Heaven</i>, the U.S. localization of <i>Rhythm Tengoku Gold</i>.  This game was on several of our wishlists before we'd even heard about the DSi, and to be able pick it up at the same time as our new handhelds just sweetens the deal.<br />
<br />
It's enough to make me love Nintendo again.  A little.
