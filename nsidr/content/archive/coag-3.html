<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial">Episode III - Early Teen Ignorance</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">By: Dean Bergmann</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/coag3.jpg" alt="ouch" align="left">Welcome back my well-established fan base, This is Dean
Bergmann once again with another episode of the well-established series of
articles with the well-established name of <i>Confusions of a Gamer</i>! I'm not
normally one to use exclamation marks in my writings but please keep in mind I
just woke up, and within the last week I have almost died twice. Normally when I
write an article of this style I'll include an image (albeit embarrassing) of
myself on the left of the opening (this) paragraph. Last Saturday, not even an
hour after I posted last week's <i><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=features/confusions_episode2.htm">Confusions
of a Gamer</a></i>, I got into a pretty big accident on the way to a friend of
mine's birthday party -- that's my car on the left. I'm okay however, and I'm
still able to write, walk, and all the other good stuff an 18 year old should be
able to do. So with that all said, it's time to talk about stuff relevant to our
gaming life, and that my friends are the kids (typically 13-15 years old) who
are just starting out high-school; the kids who never played games when they
were younger and only started playing games in the post-Playstation era.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I'm sure you've all run into these types of kids if any of
you are currently in high-school, or work at a gaming store -- these kids
believe that because they play <i>Grand Theft Auto 3</i> and/or <i>Vice City</i>, they are therefore the coolest gamers out there. Not only do they
believe they are the coolest, they also believe that they know everything about
any game for the PlayStation 2, XBox, and will likely believe the GameCube is
the worst console on the market. It's not so much the fact that they like the
PS2/Xbox over the GameCube, it's the insane bull-shit they throw out there (see:
lies) to tell you how much superior their console is over the one of your
choice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Not too long ago I was in Electronics Boutique (yes,
quizzing them, asking them the Onyx question) and was browsing the used games
section. This kid, about fifteen years old, comes up to me and begins telling me
that the game I was holding (<i>SSBM)</i> was the worst game for the GameCube
and that the only fighter worth getting was available on the PlayStation 2.
Knowing that he would be a fountain of inspiration for this very article, I
continued on watching his mouth spew forth continuous piles of steaming bull.
One by one he grabbed GameCube games and told me everything that was wrong with
them - including games that we know are some of the best on the console - until
he got to <i>Metroid Prime</i>. When he picked up the box, I told him that I
really enjoyed the game and it provided a really tough challenge and immersive
storyline with great game play mechanics. He looked at me for about two seconds,
quickly ran to the XBox section and picked out the box for Halo. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I could tell right off the bat this kid had never played <i>Metroid</i>,
and the way he was describing previous games to me was largely based by looking
at the screenshots on the back of the boxes. Before he started talking about
Halo and it's supremacy over the "piece-of-shit" <i>Metroid</i>, he
began to tell me that the game play in Metroid was horrible because most of the
time you're a little ball and it's entirely in third person (the screenshots on
the back of the Canadian cover shows a picture of the morph ball). On top of
this, he told me the character (Samus), no wait, I'll quote it for you:
"The guy who you're playing as looks like a girl, no guy has a waist like
that". Almost unable to hold in the laughter, I just looked in awe and
wonder at this kid.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I'm not going to waste much more time on this kid because
just remembering it makes me feel dirty - to make a long story short, he began
an entire sales pitch on <i>Halo</i> and how good the Xbox was.  After he
completed his little rant I went into full editor-mode. I started off with his
Xbox arguments and knocked them down one by one, and asked him what other games
for Xbox were as good as his praise for <i>Halo</i>? I gave him 5 seconds to
answer and since he was attempting to think, I continued on. I took him back to
the GameCube section, told him everything about every game he mentioned to me
and picked up <i>Metroid Prime</i> once again. I told him first off the bat that
you <i>are</i> playing as a girl, to which he just snuffed and his homophobia
set in -- secondly I told him that the game is in both first and third person,
the graphics are incredibly impressive, and that the morph ball plays a small,
but important part of the game. When I was done he looked at me with a confused
look on his face, thinking I was full of total BS, he went to ask the EB
employee for clarification.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The episode mentioned above went on for about 15 more
minutes, and in the end I was asked to leave the store, and so was this kid.
Sadly enough these occurrences do not just happen in gaming stores. Having
graduated from high school this year, I had the <i>pleasure</i> of dealing with
the new generation of idiot gamers out there. As a pick-up course in my final
year, I took grade 11 photography, which is a tech course so anyone in grade 10
or above can take it. One example of wasted life-essence was this kid named
Ryan; now I don't want it to sound like I hate this kid -- well, yes I do -- but
he was one of those kids who you knew had no friends, joined the Anime club,
wore various anime shirts and had a lot of those 'dragon' throw-over button up
shirts that kids like that wear. To top it off, he had a lazy eye and you
guessed it, always tried to jump into conversations pretending to know exactly
what the parties involved were talking about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Just before E3 I was talking with my teacher about it (and
since he has three kids under ten, he knows a bit about gaming and asks me about
consoles and what would be good to get, etc.) and we were talking about the
various job opportunities and products that would be presented while we were
down there. In comes Ryan, who not only cuts me off but starts talking about the
history of E3 and how it used to be in Los Vegas before it went to Los Angeles
-- to which I replied "No, it was in Atlanta", he then replied that it
was in Vegas and I was wrong. I asked him how long ago it was in Vegas and he
said that the last year it was there was in 2001. Apparently what he failed to
realize was I was wearing an E3 2001 media hat (from the media breakfast) and it
bluntly says Los Angeles on it. Not only was my teacher laughing, I was just
looking at this kid with a dumbfounded look on his face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Flash forward a week and change, and I have returned from
E3. He begins to tell me that <i>Doom3</i> was playable and that the <i>Halo2</i>
game play, and I quote: "owns". I was in a conversation with a friend
of mine in the class at the time, Mike, who I've known for years and he
understands the complex mechanics that is the gaming industry. Continuing on,
Ryan buds in with the above comments to which I reply that No, <i>Doom3</i>
wasn't playable - and while <i>Halo2</i> looks amazing, it might not offer much
over the original in terms of ingenuity and upgrading it's play style. He kept
trying to drill it into my head that <i>Doom3</i> was playable, when I asked him
who he had heard that from, he said he read it in a forum somewhere. I try to
avoid this sorry excuse for a 'gamer' at all costs, and when the graduation
survey went around asking what our biggest pet peeve is, in front of his face I
said "People who don't know what they're talking about".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I think most of you will agree with me that working at a
gaming website, and you our readers keeping up to date with current news, is
kind of a double edged sword. On the upside you know things that most other
uninformed gamers don't get to know until it's printed in a magazine that only a
small percentage read, and on the downside you are forced to have conversations
with gamers who don't know as much as you, and when you know something is right,
you will get frustrated because they totally deny your facts as fiction.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I'm not entirely sure what has caused this ignorance and
uninformitivity (yeah it's not a real word, but it works) but whatever it is, we
must find the cause and stop it. I have a weird suspicion that it involves Bill
Gates, an undocumented number of golf balls, some silly putty, and six hundred
litres of chocolate syrup. While I strongly believe the previous statement, it
most likely has something to do with advertising. Effective advertising at that;
which will be my topic next week, covering not just Nintendo, but Microsoft and
Sony as well. So until the next Saturday rolls around, I'll try not to die and
grace you with my presence again.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>An Incident with The King?</b><font size="2"><br>
There I am, in Walmart's Electronics section, staring at their controllers and
other console accessories. The day before I had finaly received from Nintendo a
$10 coupon off of a WaveBird. The WaveBird had been out for over three weeks and
I was so excited I could barely stand my self. Back to the present; I scanned up
and down. No WaveBirds. Turning around I rushed over to ask the clerk.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Me: "You wouldn't happen to have any
WaveBirds?"<br>
Elvis: <i>Stares at me, with a questioning look.</i><br>
Me: "You know. The wireless controller for the GameCube?"<br>
Elvis: <i>Continues to stare.</i><br>
Me: "Ummm, its grey and wireless."<br>
Elvis: "No, we don't carry N64 stuff anymore."<br>
Me: "Uh, it isn't for the N64. Its for the GameCube."<br>
Elvis: "No, I'm sorry."<br>
Me: "Do you know when you'll have some?"<br>
Elvis: <i>Blank look.</i><br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I then decided I wasn't getting anywhere with
this pimple and had better leave before I fried his brain.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next month I return to Walmart hoping to find
they had received a shipment of WaveBirds. Alas, still nothing. But I was in
luck I thought. Elvis wasn't there. Some older man had the counter. Surely he
could help.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Old Man: "Can I help you?"<br>
Me: "Yes, you don't have any WaveBirds. The Wireless controller for the
Nintendo GameCube."<br>
Old Man: "Umm."<br>
Me: "Do you know when you'll get some?"<br>
Old Man: "Umm, no I don't."<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I finaly decided to check K-Mart. I found the
spot where they belonged, but no WaveBirds. I asked the clerk and he ran into
the back and came out with four or five units. Happily I forked over my coupon,
$20 and left for home.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Its a good thing I have a lot of self control.
Else I would be banned from Walmart. Which is scary because Walmart and K-Mart
are the only stores within a hundred miles that sell games and K-Mart's
selection is worse than "Wally Worlds".</font></p>

       First of all, you must know that you should
be getting paid for what you do for N-Sider.com.  Your writing style is
better than most sites all over the web.<br>
       Now, onto my game-store idiocy experience. 
I was low on money, but I wanted Super Smash Bros. Melee (for Gamecube in case
you didn't know; Game Stop obviously didn't), so I made the tough decision to
buy it used.  I called up the local Game Stop.  Here is the actual
conversation:<br>
<br>
Me:               
Hello, do you have Smash Bros. Melee used, and if you do, how much is it?<br>
<br>
GS guy:         Uh...that's for Game
Boy, right?<br>
<br>
Me:               
No...It's for Gamecube.<br>
<br>
GS guy:        Okay, hold on (wait a couple
minutes). Yes, we have it.<br>
<br>
Me:              
Um...how much does it cost then?<br>
<br>
GS guy:        It's $15.<br>
<br>
Me:               
Does it come with an instruction booklet?<br>
<br>
GS guy:        It sure does.<br>
<br>
Me:              
Okay.  I'll be there in a few minutes.<br>
<br>
       I left the house and drove for less than 5
minutes to get to Game Stop and proceded to the used game section.  Looking
around, I found one copy of SSBM used, sans instruction booklet and for $20. 
I thought that maybe I had called the wrong Game Stop, but then I heard the GS
guy's voice, telling a customer that Gamecube isn't worth the money.  That
is truly ignorant, as this moron actually talked a mainstream gamer into buying
an XBox with that crappy Bruce Lee game.  I seriously felt sorry for that
poor mainstreamer.<br>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Release Date + 1</b><font size="2"><br>
Hey Dean...I loved this weeks editorial!!</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I wanted to share an experience that I had at a
Zellers in Burlington, Ontario, the Tuesday that Metroid Prime was released. 
I went in the Tuesday, just hoping that we, in Canada, would get a game on the
actual release date and not the next day...why do we have to wait a day for the
games to make it here?  I guess getting the games shipped by Dog Sled is
difficult...or is it our year-round snow covered roads...or, maybe it's the fact
that we all live in igloos...that must be it :)  Ok, back on track now...I
go in and ask the lady working in the Entertainment department if they have any
copies of Metroid Prime for Nintendo Gamecube.  She looks in the cabinet
and can't find, I tell her that it just came out that day, so she goes behind
the counter and fumbles through some boxes and says that she can't find it, but
they do have it on PS2.  I explain to her that it's a Nintendo made game,
so it is exclusive to the Gamecube.  She then goes on to tell me that if it
was available on the PS2 it would've been better...I just laughed at her and
left.  I drove down the road and picked the game up at Future Shop. 
Why are employees so dumb!?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Well, that's it for the stories this week. And if
you want to know how I almost died the second time, well, I had to  change
the road-sign for the theatre in the pouring rain -- 40 foot drops are not too
fun.</font></p>
