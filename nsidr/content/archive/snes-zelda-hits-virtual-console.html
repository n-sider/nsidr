It's Monday, and there are new things for you to spend your Wii Points on.  Well, one new thing, specifically: <i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</i>.<br />
<br />
The title is, as all Virtual Console releases thus far, a pixel-perfect reproduction of the original release&mdash;in this case, it's exactly what hit the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.  The title was also remade on the Game Boy Advance by Capcom and was released in that format in 2002 along with multiplayer-only Zelda game <i>Four Swords</i>.<br />
<br />
Getting A Link to the Past onto your Wii will cost you 800 Wii Points.
