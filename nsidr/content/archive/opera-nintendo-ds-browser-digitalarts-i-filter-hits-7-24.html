<p>Nintendo DS Browser is set to land on the island of Japan on July 24, 2006 for around $33.  The software will intitially be sold through its official Japanese <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/browser/index.html">webpage</a>.  Two versions will be released to accommodate the different-sized Game Boy Advance slots on the Nintendo DS and DS Lite.  In <a href="http://my.opera.com/DotEd/blog/show.dml/312665">initial impressions</a> of the browser, it has been found the software will allow users to take screenshots of their web travels.  However, the purpose of this feature, at this point in time, is anyone's guess.  Overall impressions of the browser sound positive.</p>

<p>In related news, DigitalArts announced it will develop and release a web-content filter for the Nintendo DS called <a href="http://www.daj.jp/cs/ifds/index.htm">I-Filter</a>.  The software will offer protection to children while browsing the internet, blocking access to adult and other mature websites.  The service requires a monthly fee of around $2.71 and will be available in Japan alongside the release of the Nintendo DS Browser on July 24.</p>

<p>Recall at the May Electronic Entertainment Expo, Opera also announced it will supply the <a href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2006/05/10/index.dml">internet browser</a> for the Wii next-generation console from Nintendo.  We hope to hear more news on this as well as an expected North American release date for the Nintendo DS Browser.</p>
