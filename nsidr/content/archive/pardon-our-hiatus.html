If you'd told me a month ago that E3 would end and there'd be absolutely nothing worth writing about, I'd have called you a liar.<br />
<br />
But here we are.<br />
<br />
After a profoundly disappointing show, we N-Siders are finding ourselves a bit unmotivated and a bit preoccupied with our own personal lives.  I apologize for the large gap in new content, as this new frontpage was hardly intended to go stagnant this quickly.  Rest assured: you haven't actually missed out on any breaking news, as the typical post-E3 information lull has been especially deafening for Nintendo fans this year.<br />
<br />
Give us another week or two, and we'll be back on our feet.  We've got a few interesting pieces in production, and I'll be rolling out some of the new content indexes I promised back during the show.<br />
<br />
Until then, why not poke around in some of our more popular forum threads, including <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=4491">rants</a>, <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=4499">holograms</a>, and <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?t=4502">lists that will totally never reach 2000</a>.
