<p>4ColorRebellion has word this morning that Namco's original Tales game for the Nintendo DS, <i>Tales of the Tempest</i>, <A href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/03/01/tales-of-the-tempest-pushed-back/">has been delayed in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The title was originally set for a release on April 13 but has been pushed back to June 8.  Namco has not yet said if or when they plan to bring this title outside Japan; the success or failure of the upcoming <i>Tales of Phantasia</i>, to be published in North America by Nintendo on March 6, may well play a part in that decision.</p>
