Nintendo <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUST5345420070925">passed Canon today</a> to become Japan's second most valuable tradable company.  According to Reuters, at the close of trading, Nintendo's market value was 8.39 trillion yen, or $73.03 billion compared to Canon's 8.12 trillion yen valuation.<br />

Analysts figure demand for both Nintendo DS and Wii will continue strongly into the holiday season, noting that even though the company had no official presence at the Tokyo Game Show, many other companies were there to show off their latest wares for Nintendo platforms.<br />

Despite this success, if Nintendo has their sights set on the number one spot, they've got quite a ways to go.  Toyota sits atop the charts with a market valuation of 24 trillion yen&#8212;three times that of the house of Iwata.
