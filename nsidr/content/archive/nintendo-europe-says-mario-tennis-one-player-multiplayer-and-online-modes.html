<p>In the game description of <i>Mario Tennis</i>, Nintendo-Europe mentions an "online mode".  It is unknown the specifics or what is actually referred to with the "online mode", however feel free to read it in its original context <a href="http://www.nintendo-europe.com/NOE/en/GB/news/article.do?elementId=cfb54863-0cfd-4c8a-9306-ff8e42a8240a">here</a> - and of course, wait for an official announcement before jumping to any conclusions.</p>
