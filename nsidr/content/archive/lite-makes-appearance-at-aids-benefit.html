<p>From the slow news day department: This past Sunday, the day the Nintendo DS Lite was released to joyous throngs everywhere, Nintendo recruited celebrities including Christian Slater, Ellen Pompeo and Rachel Bilson to man their Nintendo DS Lite Lounge at the "A Time for Heroes Celebrity Carnival" benefit.</p>

<p>The event is held annually and finds over 100 celebrities donating their time.  This year's event was intended to raise over a million US dollars for pediatric AIDS research.  And to wrap this all up, here's Christian Slater, working very, <em>very</em> hard to raise money (where can I find a gig like this?)</p>
