E-mail notifications sent out to Wii owners who used <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/strapreplace.jsp">Nintendo's online form</a> to request the new-style Remote wrist straps with the thicker loops indicate the replacment strap orders should have begun shipping yesterday.<br />
<br />
In addition to the replacement straps, the orders contain a part described as "INSERT, WII REMOTE SUGGESTIONS"&mdash;perhaps a pamphlet reminding excitable Wii owners that they don't have to throw their Remote at 90mph to get a fastball of similar speed pitching in <i>Wii Sports</i>.<br />
<br />
The voluntary replacement program Nintendo <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2563">announced a week ago</a> was created in response to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2564">reports the company recieved</a> of breaking straps, with three resulted in minor injuries not requiring medical attention.  The replacement program will see Nintendo offering to replace 3.2 million straps and will cost the company several million dollars.
