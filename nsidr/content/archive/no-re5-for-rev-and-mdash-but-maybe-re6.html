<p><a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/articles_dossiers243_resident-evil-ds.html">A Jeux-France interview</a> with <i>Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</i> producer Minoru Nakai has revealed that <i>Resident Evil 5</i> will not make an appearance on Nintendo's Revolution console &mdash; but future entries in the series just might.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147120">a story at 1UP</a>, Nakai says RE4's rethinking of the series mechanics doesn't really suit the Revolution's unique control.  However, Nakai also says that he thinks that in the not-so-distant future, players may indeed tire of the RE4 model, and wish for something new &mdash; and that's where Revolution could come in.</p>

<p>Nakai also indicates players won't have to wait for RE6 or a later installment to see Revolution support from his team, as he hints that he's working on a non-RE title for Revolution in addition to several projects in his head intended for the Nintendo DS.</p>
