<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3186-1.jpg" width="200" height="221" class="image_styled" /></div>Cult import hit <i>Rhythm Tengoku</i> for GBA, a rhythm game created by the team that created <i>Wario Ware</i>, is set to get a very interesting remix courtesy Nintendo and Sega: as an arcade game.<br />
<br />
The arcade version of the game plays much like GBA title, with ported-over versions of the original's rhythm minigames.  In single-player mode, you have two "lives" with which to get as far as you can in the game.  Each stage has five minigames and one remix, like the GBA title; whether the full eight stages are available or not is unknown.  A two-player mode is also available, where both players go up against four stages.  At the conclusion, the game will tell you how in-sync you were with the other player.

Rhythm Tengoku&mdash;in any form&mdash;has yet to make an appearance outside Japan, and with the peaceful old-age death of Game Boy Advance, it seems unlikely the original version will.  However, with Nintendo still actively considering the game as they have for this arcade port, there is at least some hope we might see it stateside, in some form.
