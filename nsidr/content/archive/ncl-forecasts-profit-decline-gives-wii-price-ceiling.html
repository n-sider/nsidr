<p>Nintendo has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000101&sid=aSlFrz4it7Ac&refer=japan">forecasted this morning</a> their profit will be falling 34% in this fiscal year due to the dollar's decline against the yen, and saw their stock slide 10% on their recent earnings announcement &mdash; the most it has in 3&frac12; years.</p>

<p>However, this does not mean Nintendo's in dire straits by any measure.  Operating profit &mdash; the measure of sales minus the cost of goods &mdash; is expected to rise 22%.</p>

<p>Bloomberg has comment from Hiroshi Kamide of KBC Securities in Tokyo on the issue. "There is always a bit of a psychological issue with the foreign exchange gains or losses.  I wouldn't say their business model is getting weaker or their positioning in the market is getting worse. I think things are going to get better."  Kamide has a "buy" rating on Nintendo.</P>

<p>Nintendo revealed it is counting on its upcoming <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Wii</a> home console, with its lower price and unique controller, to draw buyers away from Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360.  The company said it would charge no more than 25,000 yen for the system in Japan, which works out to about US$223.  US launch price will be under $250, and the company plans to ship 6 million systems to retailers worldwide by the end of its 2006 fiscal year on March 31, 2007.</p>

<p>Nintendo also said it will increase its R&D spending from 30 billion yen to 32 billion yen, and that it will be investing 25% more in capital costs, including manufacturing facilities for Wii. The company also expects to ship 16 million <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a> systems (up from last year's 11.5 million) and 2.5 <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a> systems this year.</p>
