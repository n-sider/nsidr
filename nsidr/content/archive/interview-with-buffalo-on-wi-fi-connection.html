<p>In the interview, Sano reveals in the interview that the adapter will support versions of Microsoft Windows between 98 and XP, discusses the simplicity of the AOSS setup process, and claims the range is comparable to most typical wireless access points.  Sano defers a few questions to Nintendo, namely whether the Connector will work with other 802.11 devices and the product's wireless security options.</p>
