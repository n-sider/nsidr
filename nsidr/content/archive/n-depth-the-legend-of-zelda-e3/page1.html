<P>It's not very often that a developer unveils a game as big as the Legend of Zelda, and it's also not very often that a developer makes such a radical visual change to such a tried and true formula.  As such, a mixture of anticipation and concern from Nintendo's fan base prompted the construction of this feature.  Inside you'll find a complete analysis of the gameplay mechanics that make up this whopper of an adventure, as well as a level-by-level breakdown of the entire E3 demo.  Top if off with some hefty impressions at the end, and you've got a lot of reading to do, buddy.  Use the links in the N-Data bar to the right to navigate, or just click below to start.</P>
