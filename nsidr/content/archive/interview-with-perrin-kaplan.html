GameCloud has published an interview with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a>, Nintendo of America Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs.  Kaplan speaks about the recently revealed Revolution controller as well as plans for the Nintendo DS and Nintendo GameCube.  Check out the full interview <a href="http://www.gamecloud.com/article.php?article_id=1908">here</a>.  An excerpt is below:<br><br>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Gamecloud </b>- The Revolution may be the final console in the "next-gen" period (PS3-Xbox 360) to launch in the US. Do you believe that the Revolution will still be able to compete with Sony and Microsoft's new consoles in terms of sales and do better than the GameCube did in this country?
<br><br>
<b>Perrin Kaplan</b> - Until we see PS3 launch, its not accurate to say well be last. But frankly, whats most important is to never rush to market just to be first. Nintendo is all about gaming first and foremost, and the unique and innovative products were creating for Revolution will make our system a must-own for gamers both new and old no matter what other hardware is on the market. Were currently working hard to secure all the necessary elements for a successful launch such as key first-party titles and solid third-party support when Revolution hits next year.
