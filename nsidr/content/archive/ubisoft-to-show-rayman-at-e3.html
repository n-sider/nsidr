<p>Ubisoft has announced their E3 2006 lineup today, and in addition to previously-announced Wii title <cite>Red Steel</cite>, they've unveiled the Rayman title they've been working on: <cite>Rayman Raving Rabbids</cite>.</p>

<p>Ubisoft describes the game as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>Developed by famed creative director Michel Ancel, this new installment of the Rayman franchise will be the funniest and zaniest yet. Rayman's world is threatened by a devastating invasion by the most unexpected creatures and Rayman must battle to save his world and its inhabitants.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, we're all just focusing on Rayman's awesome new hairdo for now.  With luck, we'll get a chance to get our hands on this title at the upcoming E3 show next week.</p>
