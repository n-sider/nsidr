<p>The <a href="http://www.nintendoworldstore.com/">Nintendo World Store</a> will play host to midnight sales of the lighter, brighter <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a> when the system officially launches the morning of June 11.</p>

<p>The line to get the system will start building at 9 p.m. on Saturday, June 10.  Nintendo will have a local DJ, Mario (or at least some guy in a Mario suit), and pizza for those lined up.  At the stroke of midnight on the 11th and running until 2 a.m., the store will begin selling the systems to those lined up.  The first 100 purchasers will get a free case.</p>

<p>The Lite has been quite the hardware sales sensation in its home country of Japan.  Nintendo appears to be hoping they can replicate the same success elsewhere around the world.  The system has already launched in Australia and will be launching in Europe June 23.</p>
