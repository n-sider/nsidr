Monday again brings three titles released on Wii's Virtual Console service here in North America.  This week's titles are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Tecmo Bowl</i> (NESÂ®, 500 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Sonic Spinball</i> (Sega Genesis, 800 Wii Points)</li>
  <li><i>Double Dungeons</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 Wii Points)</li>
  </ul><br />
All three titles will be available for you to spend Wii Points on at 9 a.m. Pacific time (which is physically an hour earlier this week due to the craziness of the new Daylight Savings Time rules).  Just head on over to the Wii Shop Channel and spend, spend, spend!
