Earlier today, the March NPD numbers were released.  Nintendo found themselves on top for the third straight month this year with some pretty amazing hardware sales:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Nintendo DS: 508K</li>
  <li>Wii: 259K</li>
  <li>Game Boy Advance: 148K</li>
  </ul><br />
Interestingly, Game Boy Advance outsold Sony's next-generation PlayStation 3 this month.<br />
<br />
Nintendo offered the following comment to N-Sider regarding their success this past quarter:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">With the first quarter of 2007 now completed, Wii has already notched over a million systems sold in America this year, while the DS now stands just shy of 1.25 million for the same period. <br />
<br />
Through the first quarter of this year, Nintendo has sold more video game systems than all other manufacturers combined.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Despite widespread product shortages, Nintendo again sold through virtually every Wii and Nintendo DS that it delivered to retail.<br />
 </li>
  <li>Wii remains the fastest-selling new console in more than a decade, based on NPD sell-through information over the first five months of availability.</li>
  <li>Shipments are increasing due to increased production.</li>
  <li>Nintendo is making every effort to satisfy this unprecedented demand for a new home game console.</li>
  <li>DS exceeded sales of a half million systems again in March, and lifetime sales in America now surpass 10 million.</li>
  </ul></div>
