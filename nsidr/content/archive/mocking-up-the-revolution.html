<p>At <a href="http://www.rllmukforum.com/">rllmukforum.com</a>, poster Tsietisin has <a href="http://www.rllmukforum.com/index.php?showtopic=104969&st=0">mocked up the Revolution control scheme</a> for FPS using a Gyration mouse and a one-handed ASCII PS1 controller.</p>

<p>In his post, Tsietisin reports: "It all seems to work pretty good. Aiming can be a little more difficult than using a mouse on a flat surface, your hand will tremble slightly so it will shake the movement on screen as well. I am sure that with practice you can get this down to a minimum.</p>

<p>"I do think that I need to have more practice playing with this kind of a setup. I do think that it is going to work, just needs lots and lots of practice as it is a way of playing not used by the masses before."</p>
