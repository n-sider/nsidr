Masahiro Sakurai has once again started up his Super Smash Bros.<br />
<a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/index.html">development blog</a>, and the official Smash Bros. website has updated appropriately to accommodate him.<br />
<br />
In his old blog, which consisted of a total of three entries since Super Smash Bros. Brawl's original debut, Sakurai stated that he would not provide new updates until the release of SSBB drew near. It is probably safe to assume that he will follow the same pattern he did with Super Smash Bros. Melee, which consisted of releasing new information regularly until the day of release, followed by the secret characters after release.<br />
<br />
Currently available to fans of the series are the two previously released videos from last year's E3 and Nintendo World events; a list of the <a href="http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/music/music01.html">over 35 composers</a> working on the soundtrack, including Jun Fukuda (killer7/Contact), Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger/Xenogears), Tomoko Sasaki (NiGHTS), and many other industry darlings; a basic rundown of the gameplay mechanics; and a preview of a classic stage, Battlefield. The website is supposed to update daily, excepting weekends, with news of characters, gameplay, game modes, stages, items, or music.<br />
<br />
The site claims that the game is currently planned for a 2007 release in America and Japan.  The various European websites, however, are notably missing a similar announcement.  N-Sider will keep you up to speed with any major news pertaining to this highly anticipated title.
