<p>One interesting tidbit surfaced while Miyamoto was relating stories of internal difficulties designing the Wii Remote one-handed controller.   "We're still debating on the area of how many buttons to use," he said.  The goal of the system, he said, was "to make something that could be used every day like a television."</p>

<p>Miyamoto also had comment on a recent next-gen interest survey conducted by Famitsu.  Wii led that survey with 70%, but Miyamoto was not satisfied.  "Was there a selection for 'I don't want any of them'? I'd like to know this, because we're fighting this 'I don't want any of them' selection."</p>
