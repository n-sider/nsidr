As it stands, as the demo exists on the E3 show floor, <i>Namco Museum Remix</i> is surprisingly(?) the biggest piece of crap on display for the Wii system.  Namco Museum Remix is, according to someone near to it who I think may have been employed by Namco, "a re-imagining of the classics," and total evidence that since they can't even get close to matching them they just refused to try.<br />
<br />
The desecration of <i>Galaga</i> is by far the worst offender, and one of the greatest arcade games ever has essentially been transformed into a <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> Gold Saucer shooting gallery where you protect an auto-pilot Pac-Man rolling along a series of tubes from getting shot by 3D renditions of Galaga creatures.  This works by pointing at the screen and pressing B on the remote a lot.  The particularly hostile ones emit little red circles like in Time Crisis to let you know they're about to fire.  Levels just end once you've stopped Pac-Man's termination and then, in the demo at least, you select a new one.<br />
<br />
<i>Rally-X</i> didn't leave as sour a taste in my mouth because nobody remembers or cares what the original Rally-X was even like.  In its new incarnation it consists of a 3D overhead view of your little nunchuk-controlled car trying to grab some flags.<br />
<br />
It's a good thing this pack will reportedly have "over fourteen games" in it because at five minutes of entertainment a piece you'll at least get about an hour out of it!
