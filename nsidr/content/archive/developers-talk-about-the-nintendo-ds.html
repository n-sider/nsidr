<p>Want to know what developers think about the Nintendo DS? Read on to find out.</p>

<p>When Nintendo came down and presented the DS platform to us,  I think everyone was in shock. It was amazing.  Our technical and central technology guys were kind of drooling at the abilities and wanting so much to program and dive into programming for the system.  Nintendo DS, I believe, is a revolution in change for hand-held gaming.
<i> Will Kassoy, vice president, global brand management, Activision</i></p>

<p>I believe that Square Enix has a promising chance in the platform, since Nintendo DS allows users to experience whole new game play with both its input system and its output system.
<i> Yoichi Wada, president and representative director, Square Enix</i></p>

<p>The Nintendo dual screen is something that were really excited about developing for. Its very innovative, which is classic Nintendo.
<i> Nick Earl, vice president and general manager, Electronic Arts</i></p>

<p>The fact that touch panels can be associated with many terms about touching that we never had, such as touch, push, feel, rub, slide and pat is wonderful.  I have been working in this industry for 20 years. During that time I made many games. But I think this is the first time that we have a new input device.
<i> Yuji Naka, senior corporate officer, development division, Sega</i></p>

<p>Once again Nintendo is taking another leap in the gaming experience for the gamer by providing totally new game-play experiences, developing new gaming habits. Very characteristic of a Nintendo maneuver.
<i> Jay Cohen, vice president, publishing, Ubisoft</i></p>

<p>Nintendo DS is a new game machine that will build the future of the game industry.  Our frontier spirit has been awoken.
<i> Tsunekazu Ishihara, chairman and CEO, Pokmon</i></p>

<p>This has a huge potential.  It is very nice that we can create games using DS that were not even possible before.
<i> Yoichi Haraguchi, vice president and executive officer, Namco</i></p>

<p>Nintendo has a reputation for doing extraordinary things in the hand-held space. The DS is an extraordinary device, and we are going to do everything in our power to support it.
<i> Michael Pole, executive vice president, worldwide studios, Vivendi Universal Games</i></p>

<p>Nintendo DS is going to push the hand-held technology to really uncharted territories. By that I mean that its going to bring amazing new game mechanics, new game design.
<i> Yves Blehaut, senior vice president, Atari</i></p>

<p>I think the DS will stimulate the process of game development.
<i> Tomofumi Gotsubo, president and CEO, Konami of America</i></p>
 
<p>DS is deceptively amazing.  Touch screen is a very blank canvas for a game designer to be able to design their own input features.  DS really could be a killer to PSP.  I really think the Nintendo DS could kick the crap out of Sony PSP.
<i> Kevin Ray, chief technology officer, Majesco</i></p>

<p>The wireless capability potentially allows game players to connect wirelessly literally around the world.
<i> Brian Farrell, president and CEO, THQ</i></p>

<p>I am sure people have nice memory of yelling at a controller. Now, we have a more established function of inputting our voice.  Nintendo always pleasantly surprises us with interesting projects and interesting ideas.
<i> Keiji Inafune, producer, Capcom</i></p>
