The game is developed by Interactive Brains under publisher Atlus Software.  Check out the title's official <a href="http://www.atlus.com/deeplaby/">website</a> for more details (or go to at least enjoy the music).</p>

<p>A boy and his dog wander through the country-side when they come upon a mysterious castle. In a 3D adventure using the DS touch screen, players delve into the castle's cavernous interior to uncover its secrets.  Deep Labyrinth currently has a 55 percent average review ranking according to <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/925560.asp">GameRankings.com</a> (based on 3 reviews).</p>

"Deep Labyrinth has a good chance at becoming a cult hit. Those who adore unique games, particularly DS games that rely on the touchscreen and microphone, will enjoy this title. The gameplay can be exciting at times, and there are some puzzles that involve blowing and screaming into the microphone. However, those who dislike problematic interfaces, lackluster stories, and DS interactivity gimmicks should stay far away from this labyrinthine fiasco."

"If you're not into dungeon hacks, Deep Labyrinth certainly won't do much to win your heart. It's like a faster, more fluid King's Field, all the way down to the ugly, 3DO-quality graphics -- not everyone's cup of mead, to be certain, but still a satisfying first-person hack-n-slash for those who prefer to take their treasure-hunting on the go."

<b>EGM says</b> (7.5/10, 2/10 & 3/10),<br>
"Deep Labyrinth is a classic dungeon hack (stranded in a dungeon, no way out, fighting from level to level, acquiring better gear and skills, etc.) straight out of the Wizardry school of RPG design.  That is, the old school.  Oh, and bring headphones -- Yasunori "Chrono Cross" Mitsuda's soundtrack is truly a thing of beauty."
