<p>Famitsu has <a href="http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/2006/07/14/104,1152888419,56933,0,0.html">some details</a> about Konami's upcoming <cite>Winning Eleven DS</cite>, which will release with a bundle featuring <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/720/720146p1.html">yet another custom DS Lite</a>.</p>

<p>The title will make use of the Nintendo DS touch screen to permit players to choose and change formations on the fly, something that previously required pausing the game and entering the formation option screen.  For multiplayer, the title will run the gamut, with both single-card DS Download Play and online play available.  A new DS-exclusive "World Tour" game mode will also be available.</p>

<p>The game launches alongside its previously-mentioned bundle September 21 in Japan.</p>
