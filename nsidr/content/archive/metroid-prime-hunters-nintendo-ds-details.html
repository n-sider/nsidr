<p>Nintendo of America held a press summit at its Redmond, WA, headquarters in order to show off the latest completed Wi-Fi Connection compatible title. As you've probably guessed, that game is <i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i> and is scheduled to hit the Nintendo DS on March 20.  Hunters was developed by Nintendo Software Technology Corp. Some familiar faces we've seen on the development team include director <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=2">Masamichi Abe</a> and game designer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=629">Richard Vorodi</a>. Several members from the gaming press were invited to NOA's headquarters.  Although N-Sider wasn't there, we've taken the liberty of compiling all the relevant info from various attendees in one concise update.</p>


<p><ul><b>Single Player</b>
<li>NST claims it took them around the same time to play through single player Hunters as the original Metroid Prime for Nintendo GameCube.
<li>The game's story occurs between Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime: Echoes.
<li>Each boss battle is introduced with an FMV clip using both screens.
<li>IGN noticed slight slowdown during a boss battle with "Spire".
<li>Samus has all her powers available to her from the beginning of the game, a departure from other titles in the series.
<li>Like Metroid Prime for GameCube, players can scan items through the scan visor mode.
<li>First level feels like a training level to acquaint players with the control system.
<li>A 3D map allows players to orientate themselves in each level.
  </ul></p>

<p><ul><b>Control</b>
<li>Several controls available for left or right handed players.  Touch screen or standard digital pad can be used.
<li>Touch screen can be used to control player's view - up, down, left or right.
<li>Radar of immediate enemies is located on the bottom screen.
<li>Touch screen buttons allow you to toggle between your morph ball or scanning visor or between blasters or missiles.
<li>Touch screen sensitivity can be adjusted based on player's preference.
  </ul></p>

<p><ul><b>Multi-Player</b>
<li>Each player receives a "Hunters License" which keeps track of your Wi-Fi wins and losses and lets others know how many times you've dropped from a game.  You start with 100 percent and it decreases if you intentionally turn the power off (the number is not affected if it's an accidental loss of connection).
<li>Samus or six other unique bounty hunters can be used in battle.
<li>The "Rival Radar" allows a player to grab hold of someone else's profile and track that individual's progress over the Nintendo Wi-Fi network.
<li>Modes include Survival, Bounty, Defender, Capture, Prime Hunter, and Nodes.
<li>There are 19 different battle arenas to choose from.
<li>Options are customizable and include turning on or off radar and friendly fire, adjusting level of damage from shots, and choosing the type of weapons.
<li>A single cartridge can be used for local wireless play.  However, you'll need everyone to have a copy of the game to take advantage of the real multiplayer meat.
<li>In addition to battling with those on your friend's list, random encounter play is also available.
  </ul></p>

<p><ul><b>Prime Hunter Mode</b>
<li>The first person to kill another becomes the Prime Hunter.  Their health continually depletes and will only replenish if they attain another kill.
<li>The player who remains the "Prime Hunter" the longest wins.
  </ul></p>


<p><ul><b>Lobby Chat</b>
<li>Chatting occurs in the lobby before multiplayer.  No in game chat is available.
<li>Chatting is done in a walkie-talkie fashion.  One player at a time holds the A button to talk and send a message.
<li>An on-screen keyboard is also available to send messages while in the lobby.
  </ul></p>


<p><ul><b>Nintendo Wi-Fi.com</b>
<li>Nintendo's website will track information relating to winning streaks, kill streaks, headshots, who the player's favorite hunter is, who their rivals are, and how long they've spent playing the game online.
<li>Leaderboards will compare your stats with people on your friends list.
<li>The game's official website is located at <a href="http://www.metroidhunters.com">metroidhunters.com</a>.
