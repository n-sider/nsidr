<p>Our friends at <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/">Cubed3.com</a> asked us to pass a message on to their readers in the Nintendo online community.  Earlier this week, Cubed3's domain was maliciously taken advantage of by hackers. The site has since been removed from their server and subsequent attempts to restore the site to their domain have failed.  The staff is unsure of the time frame it will take to recover the site and return it online. The staff of N-Sider wishes them the best of luck.  If you have any questions, you can contact Cubed3 editor <a href="mailto:jimminy@jillikers.fsnet.co.uk">James Temperton</a>.</p>
