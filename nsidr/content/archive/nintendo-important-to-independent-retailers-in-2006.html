According to <a href="http://www.mcvuk.com/newsitem.php?id=674">MCVUK</a>, Nintendo is striving to help indepenent video game retailers compete with chains and supermarkets.  The company is said to currently operate under open distribution, meaning it sells hardware and software directly to any company that agrees to its terms and conditions.  MCV has spoken to several stores who say Nintendo, along with Konami and Capcom, are one of the more popular suppliers among indepenent game stores.  They note however, that "significant change" is needed for next year after having endured a tumultuous retail environment throughout 2005.
