<a href="http://www.kotaku.com">Kotaku</a> attended <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto's</a> presentation at the Digital Interactive Entertainment Conference at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan.  During the presentation he noted that there were more secrets surrounding the Revolution that have yet to be announced (Valley Girl responds, "Like, duh!"). <br><br>

"There's another secret [about the Revolution controller]," he said. "But I'm not going to go into that here. That'll be for a later date."<br><br>

Insert requisite "wait for E3 2006" comment.
