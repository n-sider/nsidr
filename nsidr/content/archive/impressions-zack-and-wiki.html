In Capcom's booth at Barker Hangar (well, okay, it really wasn't a booth&mdash;Barker is simply full of identical gameplay stations with company representatives milling about), the highly-anticipated adventure title <i>Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros' Treasure</i> was on display in demo form.<br />
<br />
Zack & Wiki is a point-and-click adventure played entirely with the Wii Remote, with lengthy (and very humorously-written) dialogue and animation sequences.  You can point at anywhere on the screen to have Zack go there, and you can interact with various objects by pointing and clicking on them.<br />
<br />
Several of the objects I interacted with required me to use the Wii Remote in some fashion to make it do what I wanted to.  A lever was pulled by holding the Remote vertically and pulling it toward me.  I could shake Zack free from a tree he was stuck in by shaking vigorously.   Several other ways to use the items in the game based on Remote movement and button presses manifest themselves, as well.<br />
<br />
We plan to cover the Zack & Wiki demo in more depth soon, so stay tuned for our full preview coming later.
