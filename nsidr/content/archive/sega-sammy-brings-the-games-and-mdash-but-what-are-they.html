<p>The Magic Box has the scoop on Sega Sammy's recent announcement of <a href="http://www.the-magicbox.com/gaming.htm">their plans for FY 2006 releases</a> for the multitude of game platforms available today.  Without any further ado:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=13">Nintendo DS</a>: 17 titles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=14">Wii</a>: 7 titles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=11>Nintendo GameCube</a>: 2 titles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=10">Game Boy Advance</a>: 2 titles</li></ul>

<p>Speculation is rife about the number of Wii games, since Sega only showed <cite>Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz</cite> and <cite>Sonic Wild Fire</cite> at the recent E3 2006 show, and Sega told us that the latter was not even a launch title.  Similarly, Sega had only one Nintendo DS title at the show, the movie-license <cite>Charlotte's Web</cite>.  With a scant ten months left in Sega Sammy's FY 2007, it should be interesting to see what they'll pull out of their hat between now and then.</p>
