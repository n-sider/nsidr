IGN's <a href="http://ds.ign.com/articles/799/799910p1.html">interview</a> with Ed Boon has revealed the first DS entry into the Mortal Kombat series&mdash;<i>Ultimate Mortal Kombat</i>. The game includes a port of <i>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</i>, original released on SNES, and Puzzle Kombat, a puzzle fighter only previously seen in <i>Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</i>.<br />
<br />
While the two games are mostly ports, there are going to be some notable additions. One of the biggest is online play for both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Puzzle Kombat, as well as local multiplayer. Both games will also take full advantage of the dual-screen set-up. Boon says UMK3's use of the DS' features are not set in stone yet, but Puzzle Kombat will show the fighters on the top screen with all of the puzzle action on the bottom. Touch screen control was mentioned, but again, no specifics were given.<br />
<br />
Ultimate Mortal Kombat is currently set for release in November of 2007.
