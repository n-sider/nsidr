<p><a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/731/731369p1.html">IGN</a> has received word from unnamed developers who indicate Nintendo has supplied updated Wii documentation that, for the first time, detail the technical features of the Wii remote's internal memory and speaker. Sources reveal the Wii remote contains a 4,000 byte storage capacity that can be used to store controller settings and preferences. The documentation also warns of data corruption if the nunchuck peripheral is attached or disconnected while data is being saved to the Wii remote's internal memory.</p>

<p>This dispersion of information to developers means they may still have time to implement the remote memory and speaker features in their launch software.  The Wii is expected to arrive in stores within the next few months.</p>
