<p>Will Wright, chief designer of Maxis' The Sims and Spore series, shared his appreciation for the Nintendo Wii console.  "I'm rooting for Nintendo," he told <a href="http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/spore/707976p1.html">GameSpy</a> in an interview.  He did have some reservations, however.  He said, "What I don't like is that the way the Wii controller works depends a lot on how close you are to your TV. If you are five feet away it feels one way. If you are 10 feet away, it feels completely different.</p>

<p>Wright is currently developing Spore for the PC.  The title is expected to appear on all next-generation platforms as well.  Spore is an evolution-simulation game that gives players control over the complete history and future of life.  Players mold and guide a species over the generations as it evolves from microscopic algae in a pool of water to an advanced civilization that controls the galaxy.</p>
