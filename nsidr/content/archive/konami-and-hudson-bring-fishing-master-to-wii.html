Konami and Hudson have jointly announced that they will be bringing <i>Fishing Master</i>, published by Hudson and distributed stateside by Konami, to Wii.  Four <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=4141&view=screens">new screenshots</a> accompany the announcement.<br />
<br />
Fishing Master puts the player in the role of a fisherman seeking to obtain the "Fishing Master" title through increasingly difficult tournaments.  Single-player and four-player head-to-head multiplayer will make their requisite appearance, and the Remote and Nunchuk are used to bait, cast, hook, and battle (!) many different fish.<br />
<br />
The Konami-Hudson duo have been responsible for bringing a number of Wii titles to America as of late, including the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=590">impressive</a>  <i>Kororinpa: Marble Mania</i> and the sadly <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/articleview.php?articleid=585">mediocre</a> <i>Wing Island</i>.  Fishing Master will be shown off at next week's E3 show.  A release date has yet to be set, though it already hit Japan this past March as <i>Mezase!! Tsuri Master</i>.
