Nintendo alerted us today that the <a href="http://us.wii.com/wii-fit/iwata_asks/vol1_page1.jsp">first of the Iwata Asks interviews</a> concerning E3 2007 star <i>Wii Fit</i>&#8212;a long-awaited entry in the Wii franchise&#8212;is up at Wii.com.<br />
<br />
Breaking with tradition, Iwata selected Miyamoto for his first interviewee, since the project had its genesis in his own personal fitness infatuation.  In the interview, Miyamoto speaks of the graph paper he had in his bathroom where he'd chart his progress, and details many of the experiments his originally three-person team went through in creating the software.<br />
<br />
Wii Fit is due for a Q2 release in America.
