"Nintendo will take strict legal action against businesses that are earning unfair profits by selling illegal copy machineries and downloading pirated programs," goes the first statement Nintendo's Korean subsidiary has ever made regarding the rampant problem of copyright infringement in their country.<br />
<br />
An industry insider <a href="https://www.koreaherald.co.kr/SITE/data/html_dir/2007/05/05/200705050004.asp">asked about the issue</a> by the Korea Herald says an unspecified "machine" can copy DS games, and the titles have been uploaded to websites.  It's worth noting that this situation is not specific to Korea; such a setup is also easily obtainable in other territories, including North America.  Perhaps less prevalent is Korea's other problem: illegal copies of game software for all three of the big console makers are available below legitimate retail cost in electronics malls.<br />

Nintendo Korea expects to engage in enforcement actions with the help of the police, targeting web sites where illegal copies of Nintendo software is made available.  A company official, Sung Hoo-jung, said "On the request of the Korea Game Industry Agency, Nintendo has entered Korea to help the Korean game industry grow into a profitable market. However, increasing software copies and illegal downloads have dampened profitability. This can hamper the development of the game industry."
