Advanced Media Network <a href="http://wii.advancedmn.com/article.php?artid=10424">interviewed</a> Beth Llewelyn, senior director of public relations at NOA, and brought up the possibly cancelled <i>Project H.A.M.M.E.R.</i><br />
<br />
Llewelyn confirmed that H.A.M.M.E.R. had, in fact, been put on hold for other projects, but it is not cancelled entirely. As she put it several times, Nintendo has "shifted development resources." It is entirely possible that they could come back to H.A.M.M.E.R. at some point in time. She also confirmed that <i>Disaster: Day of Crisis</i> has not been put on hold and is still in full development. Unfortunately, she didn't go into any more detail about when Disaster might be released or when H.A.M.M.E.R. might be revisited, but there will hopefully be more details soon.<br />
<br />
Project H.A.M.M.E.R. is a NST-developed Wii game featuring a hammer-wielding cyborg, and Disaster: Day of Crisis is a disaster survival game also for Wii, developed by Monolith Soft.
