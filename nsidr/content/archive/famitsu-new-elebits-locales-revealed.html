The latest issue of the popular Japanese gaming magazine <i>Famitsu</i> has finally shown off some Elebits screens that feature locales other than "kitchen" and "back yard".  It seems that the entire game may take place on a single individual's property, as all of the new screens showcase other rooms in the house.  There's a hallway, what appears to be a study, a children's room, and even a bathroom.<br />
<br />
The screens also illustrate some uses for your laser other than "wreckin' the place", such as placing building blocks in alphabetical order and reorganizing books on a shelf into numerical order.<br />
