Activision today confirmed that <i>Guitar Hero 3</i>, latest in the hit series, will be making an appearance on Nintendo's Wii console for the first time.<br />
<br />
The guitar-wielding game is renowned for being easy to learn, but difficult to master. Players choose a song and must play along with it by tapping on a series of five buttons on the guitar controller. Its simple design, reminiscent of beat-accuracy games like Dance Dance Revolution, has addicted only Sony and Microsoft players before.<br />
<br />
The new series installment promises to expand the earlier formula, with online multiplayer expected, head-to-head battle modes, and the introduction of boss battles.  Authenticity is also part of the game thanks to actual rock venues, wireless controllers, and licensed Gibson guitars to choose from, with removable faceplates.  The Gibson Les Paul will be available for all other consoles except the PS2 version, which is getting the Kramer.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, downloadable songs are mentioned, even for the Wii, something which many figured would be removed from Nintendo's version due to its limited storage space.  A <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news/index_mail.shtml?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/05-23-2007/0004594448&EDATE=">song list</a> was also revealed, including hits such as Slow Ride by Fog Hat, School's Out by Alice Cooper, and Paint it Black by the Rolling Stones.<br />

Guitar Hero 3 has not yet been rated, and is planned for a fall release.
