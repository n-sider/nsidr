<p>It sounds as though someone has found an easy way to access <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendo-wi-fi-connection-faq">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> with only a dial-up connection.  For those of you interested in giving it a try, a few folks have been kind enough to put together a step-by-step tutorial of the process.  It's fairly straight-forward and requires only a few changes to your Internet settings.  More details <a href="http://www.pokemonfan18.worldfreeweb.com/other/wifi/dialupwifi.html">here</a>.  Thanks to N-Sider reader Zak for pointing this out.</p>
