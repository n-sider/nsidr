Nyko was showing off their newest Wii peripherals at E3 this week, and gave us the chance to spend a little quality time with the newest additions to their product line: their very own Wii Remote and Nunchuk paring, which they aptly call the "Wand Core Pack."<br />

<br />
Included in the package are a Nyko branded "Wand," and a new version of their "Kama" nunchuk (with added rumble feature&#8212;more on that later).  The package also includes a rubberized blue sheath and a wrist strap, covering Nyko's safety-issue bases.<br />
<br />
Immediately you'll notice the controller is identically sized and the form-factor is likewise similar. A few things to note include the square buttons as opposed to round, and the various color changes to match the Nyko brand.  The subtle changes between the official Wii Remote and Nyko's version almost seem like they were made simply to appear different, as the geometrical shape disparities serve no purpose other than cosmetic.<a name="fromspill"></a><br />
<br />
While the Wand functions much like the official remote, the buttons still suffer from the "third-party curse" that most peripheral makers encounter, and although it doesn't really detract from the overall play experience, it'd be nice to see a peripheral maker other than Logitech become successful in putting some sweet, succulent buttons on their controllers.<br />

<br />
The Kama nunchuk included utilizes the Wand's built in "Trans-Port" features to allow it to rumble simultaneously with the Wand. The Trans-Port feature of the Wand is unique to Nyko, although the peripherals do work with the official Nintendo controllers. The rumble feature of the nunchuk will only work with a Nyko Wand, and we've been told that the Trans-Port feature will also function with their newest version of the Pureshot gun accessory and a new "Wing" chat-pad due out shortly.<br />
<br />
The Kama feels a little cheap.  It's much wider than the official Nunchuk, and even though I have large hands, it still seems cumbersome and a little on the big side. The analog stick is slightly looser than Nintendo's, but not enough to be of any distraction. One quirky thing about the rumble in the Kama nunchuk is that it seems to overpower the rumble in the Wand, and while playing <i>Punch-Out!!</i> it felt weird having my left hand rumble while I was punching with my right. It's a nifty feature, but it will feel out of place in a few titles where specific appendages are utilized.<br />
<br />
If you're on a budget and need more controllers in the household, this is a great little pack that could solve your Wii Remote and Nunchuk requirements at a lower price-point. Aside from a few cosmetic disparities, this pairing functions exactly like the official offerings from the Big N, and the promise of added-feature future peripherals could be an alluring draw to Wii gamers.
