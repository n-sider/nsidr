<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-07-26-bdaman_box.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">First off is <cite>Battle B-Daman</cite>, based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_B-Daman">anime and manga</a> of the same name.  The game follows Yamato Delgado, aspiring B-Daman player, as he fights in B-Daman tournaments trying to defeat the evil B-Daplayers of the Shadow Alliance with his new toy, the Cobalt Blade. The title features a dozen battlefields, 18 characters, three modes of play and a two-player simultaneous mode.  GameRankings <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/921230.asp">has it at 65%</a> on 10 reviews.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-07-26-swordcraft_box.jpg"align="right" style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><cite>Summon Night: Swordcraft Story</cite> is an adventure game featuring the RPG-standard top-down view and a Tales-like real-time combat system.  Oddly enough, this game <em>also</em> at least starts off with a tournament, but hints at a deeper story.  Link mode for battles and item trades with friends is included.  Swordcraft Story <a href="http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/583203.asp">has 75%</a> on 10 reviews at GameRankings.</p>

<p>Both titles released Monday and should be available now.</p>
