Nintendo Power's profile on Electronic Arts' upcoming <i>FIFA Soccer 08</i> reveals that the Wii version will feature a slate of multiplayer minigames using Miis.<br />
<br />
The minigames are packaged with the game to appeal to "family members whose idea of a keeper is a boyfriend who brings flowers," the magazine says.  One minigame makes a rhythm-style game out of keeping the ball in the air, having players flick their Remote in a specific direction when the ball drops into a target circle.  Foosball is also available, alongside a shootout where multiple players shoot at a single  goalie&mdash;low scorers take goalie duties for the next round.  Playing the games will let you unlock "Ronald-mii-nho".<br />

The main game features Wii controls as well, eschewing button combinations for motion gestures.  FIFA Soccer 08 is looking toward a fall release.
