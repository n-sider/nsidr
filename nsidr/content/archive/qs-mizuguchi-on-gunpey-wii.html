<p>Gamasutra is carrying <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060821/sheffield_01.shtml">an interview</a> with Q Entertainment founder and Sega alum Tetsuya Mizuguchi.</p>

<p>Mizuguchi, speaking of <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2286">upcoming Namco Bandai release</a> <cite>Gunpey</cite>, said Q approached Bandai with the proposal.  "So Gunpey is a really primitive, nice game," Mizuguchi said. "It's not gorgeous, in terms of visual and sound, but Gunpey has a really good principle. It's like the bone of a human body. A very strong bone. And we had the idea that if we remade Gunpey with good music and visual effects, it would be pretty fun. So we asked Bandai&mdash;ok, let's remake Gunpey with new graphics."</p>

<p>Mizuguchi sees the game as a dedication to departed Nintendo alum and Game Boy designer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=536">Gunpei Yokoi.</a>  "Yeah, so Gunpei Yokoi left suddenly. He's gone. So I think it's kind of a dedication to Gunpei san, Gunpey itself. I think that's a very nice concept," he said.  "...this concept, this nostalgia, has a big influence on us. Every sound, visual, and the synthesis with the music, that sensational concept. I don't know about the future people, but hopefully they'll pick something up from this."</p>

<p>Gamasutra wrapped the interview asking about Mizuguchi's feelings on Nintendo's upcoming home console, Wii.  "We haven't decided yet about future production on Wii," Mizuguchi said.  "Yeah, so I want to make games that many people want to play, and I want many people to play them. And maybe Wii is very specialized. So if I lose the chance to show my game to a number of people, I have to think about that. But I can't tell the future."</p>
