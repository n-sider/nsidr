<p>Electronic Arts has heard that Wii will retail for around $170 in Japan, according to <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=19149">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "I've heard in Japan that the price is about $170, but I don't know if the price has been set in Europe yet," said David Gardner, executive vice president and COO of EA's worldwide studios.</p>

<p>Gardner further commented on Wii's position in the market as a result of such a low price.  "Nintendo has come up with a very clever strategy," he concluded. "They've made a choice which is great for the consumer. Now we're going to have a choice whereby consumers can buy a Wii plus one other console."</p>

<p>Gardner's information is likely based on a report issued last week from The Nikko Citigroup.  The group said the Wii console will be sold for 19,800 yen or about $170.</p>
