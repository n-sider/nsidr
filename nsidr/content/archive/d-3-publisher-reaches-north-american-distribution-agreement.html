D3Publisher of America said it has reached two separate licensing agreements to bring software to the United States and Canada.  Ditan Corporation will handle the company's distribution in America while Ditan/Synergex will represent it in Canada. The studio said <i>Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi</i> for the Game Boy Advance will be the first title to be distributed under this agreement later this year.
