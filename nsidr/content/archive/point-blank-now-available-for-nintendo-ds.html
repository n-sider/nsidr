More info can be found at the game's official <a href="http://www.namco.com/games/pointblankds">website</a>.</p>

<p>Point Blank is an established shooting series.  This title brings back the classic shooting gameplay with four difficulty levels and over 40 different stages.  The game also contains five different modes including arcade, wireless vs., freeplay and a classic coin-operated style.</p>

"Point Blank DS is a little on the shallow side, but the designers do a decent enough job spreading out the fun into a handheld package. The touch-screen replacement for light gun control works surprisingly well - I'm not hanging my light gun back in the storage closet just yet, but at the very least Namco Bandai shows that there's a place for these arcade gun shooters on the DS, and perhaps if this is successful at retail we may see other touch-screen spin-offs like the Time Crisis series."

"But the real fun lies in the mini-games. It's just a tad unfortunate, though, that the game really doesn't have much depth besides that. Granted, it's fun to play with another person and it's cool to play through the unique Brain Massage mode. But, if you're looking for a DS game that's going to provide hours of entertainment, you'll have better luck elsewhere."
