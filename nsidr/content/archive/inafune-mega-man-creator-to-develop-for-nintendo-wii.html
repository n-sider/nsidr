<p>During this past E3, <a href="http://www.planet-megaman.com/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1147733773&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&">Planet-MegaMan</a> tracked down Keiji Inafune, the creator of Capcom's Mega Man series, for an exclusive interview to discuss the Mega Man and the next-generation.  In particular, Inafune notes how his team is attracted to development for the Nintendo Wii.</p>

<p><b>Sean:</b> That's really great. And, one really quick last generic question, are you considering any Rockman titles
for the Nintendo Wii or PlayStation 3?</p>

<p><b>Keiji Inafune:</b> PlayStation 3, probably the target audience that's going to purchase the PlayStation 3, uh, it's
going to be people with a lot more money, and maybe it would not be the most suitable, uh, platform for the
Mega Man series.</p>

<p><b>Sean:</b> I agree.</p>

<p><b>Keiji Inafune:</b> However, the Wii definitely has some potential, and it's maybe one where our target audience could embrace the Mega Man series. So while we haven't planned anything specific now at this time, I think probably that the potential is the highest on that piece of hardware.</p>
