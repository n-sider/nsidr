It's been two weeks and fifty-three StreetPass tags for me here in Kobe.  What is keeping the slots of all those 3DS systems warm?  I'm happy to tell you, by way of data acquired and parsed via my representative sample!<br />
<br />
Most popular 3DS software in the entirety of Japan, based on a tiny sample of people's recently playing entries in <i>StreetPass Mii Plaza</i>:<br />
<br />
<ul><i>
  <li>Nintendogs + cats: Shiba Inu and Friends - 7</li>
  <li>Samurai Warriors: Chronicles - 6</li>
  <li>Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle - 4</li>
  <li>Nintendogs + cats: French Bulldog and Friends - 4</li>
  <li>Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition - 3</li>
  <li>Mii Maker - 3</li>
  <li>Nintendo 3DS Sound - 3</li>
  <li>Nintendo 3DS Camera - 2</li>
  <li>System Settings - 2</li>
  <li>Nintendogs + cats: Toy Poodle and Friends - 0</i></li>
  </ul><br />
3DS software with only one tag includes <i>Pro Evolution Soccer 3DS, Ridge Racer 3D, The Sims 3, Professional Baseball Famista 2011, Face Raiders, Activity Log, Pilotwings Resort, DS Download Play,</i> and <i> Nintendo Zone viewer.</i><br />
<br />
Regular DS software was all one tag or less, and included <i>Tales of the Tempest, Seventh Dragon, Dragon Quest Monsters 2 Joker Professional, Pokemon Black, </i>and <i>Dragon Quest IX.</i><br />
<br />
From the data, chiefly we can extrapolate that Japan loves dogs and dragons, but hates poodles.
