<p>Via 4 color rebellion comes <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/01/08/new-metroid-prime-hunters-info/">new information</a> for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=995"><i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i></a> out of GamePro magazine.</p>

<p>The touchscreen-based FPS sports six bounty hunters, each with their own stories and unique morphing abilities.  (Nintendo hopes that the hunters will become popular and inspire spinoff games of their own.)  The single-player game has Samus Aran chasing the other hunters as they acquire artifacts, jumping between the game's five worlds to locate and engage them.</p>

<p>As previously announced, the game's multiplayer  modes will support the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, though we're unclear at this time as to what extent (recall <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=874"><i>Mario Kart DS</i></a> had a limited selection of online-playable tracks, as well as a limited selection of modes).  GamePro says the game will come with 25 multiplayer maps.</p>

<p>The title is slated for a March 20 release in North America.</p>
