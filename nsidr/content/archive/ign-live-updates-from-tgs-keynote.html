<p><a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/651/651320p1.html">IGN</a> is performing live updates from Satoru Iwata's keynote at the Tokyo Game Show.  Keep refreshing this post for the summary below.  <b>We will be updating later with a post that verifies the information presented below.  Thank you for your patience.</b></p>
<i>
<p><b>Update 1:</b> Iwata says Nintendo has built a bigger game population in three ways: Famicom Mini (shows commercials). GB Micro. Promises more shipments next week. Then he mentioned it was Mario's Birthday week. Miyamoto stands up. Number three, Iwata says, is Nintendo DS. </p>

<p><b>Update 2:</b> Iwata mentions "touch generation" games such as Nintendogs and Brain Trainer. Nintendogs has topped one million units shipped in Japan already, according to Iwata.</p>

<p><b>Update 3:</b> 60% of Nintendogs buyers picked up the game with a DS, according to Club Nintendo statistics. </p> 

<p><b>Update 4:</b> Iwata begins topic on how to build game population going forward. </p>


<p><b>Update 5 N-Philes chat:</b> The Revolution can detect where the controller points and the distance from the screen.  It will provide a fresh experience.<br>
<br>  

Cooking Game - likely directed by Eiji Aonuma.<br><br>

Talking about the tilt sensor...<br><br>

Fishing Game<br><br>

Maybe it can be used to control jumping.  Not all though. Flexibility for expansion, the controller.  Enormous possibilities.  We're planning on selling the Revolution with a controller....  In the FPS games it can control the aiming and moving, it will set a new standard...  Can explore in the dark with a flashlight (in the game)...  We want to make a new standard in FPS games...  How can it control Zelda?...  "I hope you're as excited as I," said Iwata.  Firstly, showing it off bow, anyone will pick up a TV controller, but not a video game controller, why?</p>

<p>Just like the Nintendo DS, the Revolution will be a new way to play.  Square Enix talking...  "We like it."  Konami, "Totally unexpected.  It's good, etc."  As easy to use as a TV remote...<br><br>
Iwata: I'm very excited to see what games they make [referring to third party developers].  Virtual Console.<br>
<br>
With this new interface, we can create innovative software.  ex. Brain training games...  Nintendo is waiting for your proposals?...  We're not only going to make small games...  Making games for everyone.... Constant innovation is key. People will grow tired of gaming if we can't supply innovation. <br>
<br> Revolution controller looks like futuristic television remote. 
Glossy white design. 
Looks Apple iPod inspired. 
Controller is held in one hand. Attachments in the other. 
Attachments connect to the bottom of the controller. Iwata shows analog stick attachment. 
Thinking about packing Revolution with the main controller and attachment, Iwata says. 
Controller acts like a mouse in real-space 3D. Pefect for FPS games! 
Future attachments planned. 
Nintendo also mentioned that the controller stick could be slipped inside other, more conventional controller shells, dance mats, bongos, or other peripherals.
