<p><i>Edit: It appears the earlier information was incorrect.  The new rumored <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=248">beginning time</a> that's making its way around the internet is 2PM.  Stay tuned for a confirmation.</i></p>

<p>Although the <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=248">Japanese conference</a> isn't scheduled to begin until 10AM, word has it there may be preliminary info released  beginning at 9AM.  Whatever the case, we'll inform you of any forthcoming news as its released.  Join us in the N-Forums <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/chat/">chat room</a>.</p>
