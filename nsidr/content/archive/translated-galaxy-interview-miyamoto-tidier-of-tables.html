On the Japanese Wii site, Nintendo has been posting "Creator's Voice" interviews for certain games&#8212;<i>Super Mario Galaxy</i> among them.  In this particular interview, translated by Jim Ursetto, Yoshiaki Koizumi (Galaxy director with EAD Tokyo) delivers a unique spin on the otherwise-tired tea-table-upending habits of Shigeru Miyamoto:<br />
<br />
<div class="quote">Iwata: Now that you've worked with Miyamoto for a long time on Super Mario Galaxy, I bet you felt there were times you had finished when you hadn't.<br />
<br />
Koizumi: Indeed, many times. It was I who "upended the table", though. Miyamoto would actually ask "Why did you overturn it? It was perfectly fine as it was." and then set the table once again.<br />
<br />
Iwata: Shigeru Miyamoto, tidier of tables.</div><br />
