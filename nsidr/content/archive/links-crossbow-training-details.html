Some new details have been released regarding the upcoming Wii Zapper pack-in game. <br />
<br />
<i>Link's Crossbow Training</i> contains three game modes with nine stages each, for a total of 27 stages. The goal of each stage is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All three game modes can be played with multiple players by taking turns.<br />
<br />
The three game modes are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Target Shooting:</b> Players aim for the bull's-eye as it pops up on screen. The targets are stationary in earlier levels, but begin to move as players progress through the nine stages.</li>
  <li><b>Defender:</b> Players remain stationary but can turn in all directions by aiming off screen. The goal is to defeat the hordes of enemies that assult Link.</li>
  <li><b>Ranger:</b> Players can move throughout the level with the control stick and aim with the Wii Zapper as they fight their way through various environments such as forests and enemy encampments in this mode.</li>
  </ul><br />
Link's Crossbow Training will be packed in with the Wii Zapper for a retail price of $20, and is set for a North American release of November 11, 2007. The Wii Zapper can also be used with upcoming titles such as <i>Medal of Honor Heroes 2</i>, <i>Ghost Squad</i>, and <i>Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles</i>.
