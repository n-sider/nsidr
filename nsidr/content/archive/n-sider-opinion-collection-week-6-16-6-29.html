Gamers have been spoiled by the heated competition between PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox.  We've never had access to games and hardware at such bargain prices.  We're all a little price conscious, however when presented with half-priced software or bundled hardware, it's difficult to resist. Can we expect this trend of competitive price wars to continue?  Probably not, according to the author of this article, who predicts consumers' worst fears. A Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst believes that top games may come to cost as much as $60 in the coming years.  *eyes pop out of head*  He says that development costs would normally be in decline as game developers reach the technical limits of the next-generation platforms, however such a plateau has yet to be reached.

The author of this piece asks why publishers hide lacking gameplay behind scandalous female characters.  While the author doesn't examine the societal parallels of busty female leads in games with other entertainment, he does make it clear he's grown tired of their flagrant use in games. This quote managed to make me giggle.  <i>"Next thing you know, some company will make a game with the main character literally nothing but a set of boobs floating and bouncing in the air."</i>

You can be whoever you want to be online, but youll still make less money if youre a woman according to this article. A recent study by a noted economics professor concluded there are price differences between male and female characters auctioned off for the popular online role-playing game <i>EverQuest</i>.  Is this a reflection of some of society's still lingering issues?  This sounds like material for an episode of Oprah.

Will an online gaming utopia remain an unfulfilled dream?  Since we're on the topic of <i>EverQuest</i>, here's a related article that examines the feasibility of online games.  The author takes a look at Lucas Arts' upcoming <i>Star Wars Galaxies</i> online RPG and poses the question of whether or not games are compelling enough to justify a monthly fee.  There are a few interesting stats in the article such as, "In 2001, online gaming accounted for only 3 percent of the gaming industry's revenue."  It gives credibility to Nintendo's decision to wait until the audience has grown in size.
