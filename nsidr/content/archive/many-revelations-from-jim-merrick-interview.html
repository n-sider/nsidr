<p>Spanish gaming site <a href="http://www.meristation.com/">MeriStation</a> has an <a href="http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_articulo.php?pic=NRV&id=cw4364e1acb0d17&idj=&idp=&tipo=art&c=1&pos=0">interview</a> with Nintendo Europe director of marketing <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick</a>, quite possibly the most informative person in the entire Nintendo organization.</p>

<p>Merrick reveals several interesting pieces of news in this interview:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nintendo will be establishing 25,000 Wi-Fi hotspots across Europe</li>
<li>Wi-Fi Connection profiles will be stored in the Nintendo DS's settings area rather than on each game, allowing the connection profiles to be shared across Wi-Fi Connection games</li>
<li>The Nintendo USB Wi-Fi Adapter will retail for 39.95 Euros</li>
<li>Mario Kart DS will permit chat between users who are playing as friends, but will not permit chat between randomly matched players, to protect minors playing the game</li>
<li>No online update of PictoChat is planned</li>
<li>Nintendo's upcoming console, Revolution, will have a Download Play-like mode to enable a multiplayer game to be played across multiple consoles with only one copy of the game (it is unclear whether this mode is compatible with Wi-Fi Connection)</li>
<li>Merrick "guarantees" that Revolution will release worldwide within the same quarter</li>
<li>Games from Nintendo's retro catalog may see more stable framerates as well as localizations, but will not be made to work with Revolution's unique controller</li>
  </ul>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/">N-Forums</a> member L.J. for tipping us off to this very revealing interview!</p>
