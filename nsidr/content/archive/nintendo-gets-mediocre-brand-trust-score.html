<p>Forrester Research has released a brand trust survey, covering public perceptions of consumer brands.  According to GameDaily BIZ, <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/news/?id=12280">Nintendo only got a "B"</a>, placing it 17th among the 22 brands in the survey.</p>

<p>Nintendo's primary competitors did both much better and much worse than it did.  PlayStation maker Sony ranked only behind Bose and Apple, earning itself an "A+" grade.  Microsoft, purveyors of everything Xbox &mdash; as well as a little software package known as Microsoft Windows, which it should be noted the survey covered as well, not being limited to gaming products &mdash; finished 20th with a "C".</p>
