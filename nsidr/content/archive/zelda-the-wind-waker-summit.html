On February 16th, Nintendo of America officially begins the pre-sell program for <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>. <br />
<br />
To keep Zelda fans busy until the March 24th launch of the new Zelda, gamers who reserve a copy of the game will receive a limited-edition disk featuring <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest</i>.<br />
<br />
N-Sider suggests acquiring a copy from your local retailer while supplies last.<br />
<br />

Forum member, Ferquin retrieved artwork off the back of the preview pamphlet for <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> which is found in the prebook copy of <i>Ocarina of Time/Master Quest</i>. With help from N-Sider artist Josh Langley, the image has been cleaned up and sized for use as desktop wallpaper.  For the full size image, click on the above picture.<br />

Gathered from the recent Zelda Summit, read on for Dean's journals and detailed features of <i>The Wind Waker</i>.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Summit!</div><br />
On the days of Thursday, December 13th until Saturday, December 15th, I was in Redmond, Washington for a very small Nintendo press event. The following is a collection of my journals from that trip (and I apologize for not having it up a lot sooner, but I had taken over 250 pictures; sorting out the best ones to upload was no easy task). I won't bore you with impressions, because mine are the same as everyone else's.  To put it simply: The game was a <i>dream come true</i>. It's beauty, both in graphics and gameplay, nearly made me steal a dev 'Cube with the game in it. (But we won't talk about that...)<br />
<br />
Just a short forewarning: one or two of the pictures may contain spoilers (they will be marked) and my notes are still in raw form. To give you an idea of the length of <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>, we played for three hours before lunch and then another four hours after lunch (for anyone who can't add, that equals <i>seven</i> hours of play). After just seven hours into the game I had conquered the first dungeon, located the first island, and set sail to begin my exploration. I got the furthest into the game out of anyone at the Summit (hence redeeming my <i>Mario Tennis</i> embarrassment at E3 2k1). <br />
<br />
And before I begin, I'd like to thank Nintendo of America and Golin Harris for setting this up.  It was extremely enjoyable and the hospitality was amazing. NoA knows how to treat its guests, and they treated us like <i>kings</i>. So enough chatter; here are the journals (complete with pictures!) followed by a detailed list of features in <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Day 1: Thursday, December 13th, 2002</div><br />
<b>2:45pm:</b> I arrive at London airport for a 45 minute flight to Toronto on a lovely Dash-8.  I sit comfortably in the back row of the plane and play <i>Metroid Fusion</i> on my <i>platinum</i> Game Boy Advance.<br />
<br />
<b>3:30pm:</b> I arrive in Toronto at the <i>Pearson International Airport</i>. Confronted with a three hour layover for my flight to Seattle, I wander around until finding an <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-6.jpg">internet terminal</a>.  Content in my terminal, I plop about $5 into it and chat with N-Siders/Staff for an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
<b>6:45pm:</b> I <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-7.jpg">board the plane</a> to Seattle; happy to see it empty, I lay across an entire row and sleep. In-flight movie: <i>Bollywood Hollywood</i>, which is even more horrible than the name itself.<br />
<br />
<b>8:00pm PT:</b> I arrive in Seattle, finding customs to be a breeze (my Cineplex.com pin set off an alarm, though, heh.) - I find a <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-8.jpg">valet</a> waiting for me, with my name on a sign. I ride a luxurious town-car to Redmond, Washington and the Marriot.<br />
<br />
<b>8:30pm:</b> I arrive at the Marriot, meet <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-9.jpg">Sean and Mike</a> from N-Philes and GCAdvanced. I sign in and drop my bags off at my <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-10.jpg">room</a>. Sean and I go downstairs to meet up with Mike.<br />
<br />
<b>9:00-9:45pm:</b> The three of us walk around downtown <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-11.jpg">Redmond</a>. We decide to see a Movie (Analyze That) -- not as good as we thought it would be.<br />
<br />
<b>12:00am:</b> We get back from the movie and I <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-12.jpg">unpack</a>.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-2-3.jpg" width="398" height="292" class="image_nostyle" /></div><br />
<div class="subheader">Day 2: Friday, December 14th, 2002</div><br />
<b>7:00am:</b> I receive my wakeup call -- Sean knocks on my door as well.<br />
<br />
<b>7:45am:</b> I wander into the hall, grab Mike and Sean (who doesn't<br />
respond because he took a 45 minute shower). I go and find <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-13.jpg">Billy</a> from PlanetGameCube; I show him a preview of the <i>N-Universe</i> in his hotel room. We drink Diet (ew) Mountain Dew before we head out to Nintnedo.<br />
<br />
<b>8:00am:</b> A <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-14.jpg">Shuttlebus</a> arrives to take us to Nintendo.  On the drive there, we joke around about Nintendo, Mario, and sexuality involving the two.<br />
<br />
<b>8:20am:</b> We arrive at <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-15.jpg">Nintendo of America</a>. I strike a pose in front of my <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-16.jpg">future place of employment</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>8:30am:</b> We <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-17.jpg">enter Nintendo</a> (yes, after 10 minutes of poses). The first thing you notice in their lobby is a montage of Nintendo <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-18.jpg">characters</a> on the wall.<br />
<br />
<b>8:35am:</b> Welcome, to the Real World. The World of Nintendo is HUGE.<br />

  </ul><br />
<b>10:00am-12:00pm:</b> We finally get what we all came for.  It's "Free-Play" with <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i> (Japanese version) - NoA Localization guys helped us with translation, what to do, etc. No pictures were 'allowed' to be taken of us during gameplay, however I got permission to take <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-47.jpg">this</a> picture (I got link stuck in the water, just before a waterfall; he looked incredibly pissed).<br />
<br />
<b>12:00pm-12:30pm:</b> It's <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-48.jpg">lunch-time</a> and afterwards some more Zelda playing. The NoA guys and some other employees played <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>.<br />
<br />

  </ul><br />
<b>12:30pm-1:00pm:</b> We're taken on the Nintendo Tour. We take a trip through Nintendo Power's offices; I notice all their <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-52.jpg">hallways</a> are affectionately named. Next we visit the cream of the crop, the place where everyone wants to be: <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-53.jpg">Nintendo R&D</a> (Under double lock, keycard access and sign-in sheet). We stop off at the store, and <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-54.jpg">strike a pose</a> with Mario, not to mention <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-55.jpg">paying back the love</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>1:00-4:30pm:</b> More Zelda playing. (I snuck a little picture: <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-56.jpg">here</a>).<br />
<br />
<b>4:45pm-5:00pm:</b> It's time to leave. Everyone else goes to the Airport to fly home; I am the only one staying an extra night (hey, it was free!). I get a town-car back to the Marriot. I managed to capture some shots of the surrounding buildings before leaving: <br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-57.jpg">Nintendo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-58.jpg">The enemy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-59.jpg">NSTC</a></li>
  </ul><br />
<b>5:30pm:</b> I return to the Marriot. I go to a movie (The Hot Chick).<br />
<br />
<b>8:00pm:</b> I return to the <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-60.jpg">hotel</a>, turn on the TV for a while, order a movie, and see the <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-1-2-61.jpg">GREATEST commercial</a> ever! (it actually pulls the truck...)<br />
<br />
<b>8:00-12:00am:</b> I pack my bags to leave.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">Day 3: Saturday, December 15th, 2002</div><br />

<div class="subheader">Legend of Zelda Info</div>      <br />
Are there two timelines at the end of <i>Ocarina of Time</i>? There are "Parallel Universes" according to Nintendo of America. <i>The Wind Waker</i> is in the timeline of Adult Link, whereas <i>Majoras Mask</i> took place during the sent to the past to regain childhood link.<br />
<br />
Wind Waker opens with the re-telling of the OoT Legend (solo violin playing the classic theme, Very beautiful).  Initial game music sounds very renaissance like.<br />
<br />
<div class="subheader">The Legend</div>       <br />
The Spirit of Ganon, thought to be locked away in the sacred realm (it isnt), a giant bird kidnaps Links sister in search of girls with pointed ears (hence his sister). Ganon is looking for Princess Zelda.<br />
<br />
According to Nintendo of America, this game has "the greatest ending of any Zelda game yet".<br />
<br />
One of the islands is presumably the top of Death Mountain. There is a ring of smoke that circles it (just like OoT).  When I said I thought it was the top of Death Mountain, the NoA guys looked at each other and smiled, but refused to comment.<br />
<br />
Inhabitants of Death Island (my name for it, heh) look like a Goron/Elf hybrid.<br />
<br />
Ocean Over world = Flooded Hyrule? "I dont know" says NoA.  In my opinion, lots of evidence suggest it is, including their body language and joking nature.<br />
<br />
Is it the same Tingle? "Maybe," EAD says a young boy named Link is born to fight evil when it arises, "Maybe for each boy link, a boy tingle is born too."<br />
<br />
<i>Out of seven hours of play, I got the furthest of the group, barely completing the first dungeon and setting sail to the second island (Death Island).</i><br />
<br />
So what are you waiting for?  Get out and reserve yourself and even your friend a copy of <i>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>.
