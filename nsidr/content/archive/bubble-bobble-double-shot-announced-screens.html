Via <a href="http://www.the-magicbox.com">The Magic Box</a> comes word that Rising Star Games will be releasing <i>Bubble Bobble: Double Shot</i>, a four-player DS <i>Bubble Bobble</i> adventure, in the first quarter of 2007.<br />
<br />

In addition to namesakes Bub and Bob, a third character, creatively named Bubu, will also be featured.  In addition, the title will contain a variety of small, stylus-controlled mini-games.  100 levels are anticipated.<br />
<br />
Theoretically, this game will be bug-free, unlike this year's <i>Bubble Bobble Revolution</i>, which notoriously contained a progress-halting glitch on one of the later boss levels.
