<p>IGN.com has reported that numerous Japanese videogame websites are stating that Nintendo plans to hold a Nintendo DS "explanatory meeting" in the near future. The conference will be held sometime between February 12 - 13 of this year and take place in Osaka, Japan. Meetings are also scheduled to take place in Fukuoka and Tokyo. 

<p>For those in the dark, the Nintendo DS will be a new handheld device from Nintendo. The company has stated repeatedly that the new system will not compete with the Game Boy Advance or GameCube and will be a totally new product - a "third pillar" if you will. Little is known about the device except that it will be Dual Screen (that is, have two screens of the same size) and that those screens will be lined vertically and be a bit larger than those currently on the Game Boy Advance. Nintendo is currently planning to fully unveil the product at this year's E3 (Electronics Entertainment Expo).
