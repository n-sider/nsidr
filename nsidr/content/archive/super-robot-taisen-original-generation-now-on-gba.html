"Basically, then, SRT: Original Generation takes Fire Emblem's cavaliers, knights, and archers and replaces them with giant robots, space battleships, and futuristic aircraft. Unlike in Fire Emblem, should one of your giant robots get blown up during a given mission, that doesn't mean it's permanently destroyed; apparently, they're just that tough. This makes the game quite forgiving for the most part, though there are a few difficult missions here and there, and the last few battles against some of the game's strongest opponents are particularly tricky and drawn out. Overall, the game presents a good level of challenge and an enjoyable, long ride that you could happily come back to for a while longer. Kyosuke, one of the game's many endearing characters, inspires his fellow soldiers to place some big bets by putting their lives on the line when the stakes are high. In the spirit of that advice, you'd be wise to consider taking a chance on an unlikely little game such as this."

"So after years of being a Japanese-exclusive series, is Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation really worth the wait? That will entirely depend on you. If you're looking for a classic niche strategy game that focuses as much on turn-based battle as it does customization, Super Robot Taisen definitely has the formula down. Be warned, however, as the game's amazing sense of style and attitude can often be lost in the bland battlefield maps and near-infinite text-only tweaking sessions spent away from battles, as the series is definitely more concerned with delivering a balanced gameplay than high-scale visual and audio presentation. The game has a bit of a dated look and feel, but the gameplay is solid, and that alone will be worth it for some people. For anyone looking for a solid strategy/RPG, Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation may just be the solution, as long as you're willing to put gameplay first. And plus, it's the only game out there where characters shout the words "That doesn't even count as damage!" at their enemies. Not bad... not bad at all."

"Underneath the stylized art and strong anime-bent of Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation lies a glowing core of light strategy gameplay with some very gratifying customization elements. This well-done example of the genre won't be everyone's cup of nuts and bolts, but fans of console-style strategy games looking for a fresh campaign will appreciate the game's brisk and potentially huge playtime."
