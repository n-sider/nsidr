<p>N-Sider has learned that the GameCube samurai-pinball style game dubbed <i>Odama</i> is being developed by Vivarium Inc., the same company that developed Seaman for Dreamcast.</p>

<p>Further, the game is described as follows: "Fire the giant pinball known as Odama (tentative name) into the fray and use the flippers to send it crashing over batalions and into troop barracks.  Collect prisoners of war and they'll fight for your side, but be careful to crush your own troops.  Your men will automatically try their best to dam rivers, liberate extra flippers and clear the way to the enemy's gate."</p>
