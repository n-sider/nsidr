<b>Great site; I really like the Rabid Albino Penguin.  Why haven't you updated your Q and A?</b><br>
<i>-Artz</i></p>

<p><b>Miss Cleo:</b> I misplaced my Tarot cards, ya.  Q and A cannot be conducted without them, ya.

<p><b>Josh:</b> I don't see <i>you</i> updating the damn Q and A, now do I?

<p><b>Dean:</b> Uh, well to be honest, everyone's questions SUCKED. We even resorted to making a few of them up last time. Why can't you guys have the intelligence of our forum goers? I mean really. <i>COME ON!</i>
<hr>
<b>I'm wondering what's up with <i>Phantasy Star Online</i>? You guys had a May release date for it last time and now you have an October release date. Who's to blame and why?</b><br>
<i>-Nintendophile</i></p>

<p><b>Glen:</b> Yes, according to various internet retailers, Phantasy Star Online is listed under an October 15th release.  While Nintendo won't admit it, the reason for the delay is probably due to Nintendo's reluctance to release the GameCube modem and broadband attachments.  What choice does Sega have but to wait until those accessories are available...
<hr>
<b>Could you guys please tell me if Magical Vacation for GBA is coming out in America, or am I retarded and it's already out?  For some reason I haven't been able to receive a question to this from anyone.</b><br>
<i>-Zgemar</i></p>

<p><b>Glen:</b> The Brownie Brown developed Magical Vacation, has not been released in the US.  For reference, Magical Vacation was released in Japan on December 7, 2001.  Brownie Brown has stated its intention to bring Magical Vacation to worldwide audiences; currently however, it's not known if the company will follow through with a US release.

<p><b>Josh:</b> Considering Nintendo's ostensible change of heart as of late on bringing Japanese games stateside, it would not at all surprise me to see Magical Vacation end up over here. However, I wouldn't expect anything until at least Q4 of this year.
<hr>
<b>What do you think the next first and second party GBA games to come out in the U.S. are going to be?  When do you think they will be released?</b><br>
<i>-Cory</i></p>

<p><b>Glen:</b> From Rare we have <i>Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge</i>, <i>Diddy Kong Pilot</i>, and <i>Sabre Wulf</i> are all currently featuring a tentative 2002 release date.  There's also <i>Fire Emblem: The Sealed Sword</i>, <i>Metroid IV</i>, and the GameCube counterpart <i>Flippin' Kirby</i> on the horizon from Nintendo.

<p><b>Josh:</b> Do we have a <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=release/gba.htm">release list</a>? I guess we really ought to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=release/gba.htm">put one up</a>. Somebody <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=release/gba.htm">get on that</a>!

<p><b>Dean:</b> Damnit Josh, you're stealing my jokes. We never had a <a href="../index_content.php?page=release/gba.htm">Release List</a>. I thought you knew that.
<hr>
<b>OK, I was wondering this for awhile. Going back to N64 technology we had, I guess you could call it, volumetric water...right? So why couldn't developers theoretically implement volumetric fog for the N64; it seems they are basically the same thing. I was suprised to see rumors that GameCube may have not been able to do that either. The way I see to do it is, instead of putting code in to change the physics like the water, you could just keep the play mechanics exactly the same to mimic volumetric fog...right? I was wondering if this is the case.</b><br>
<i>-ml</i></p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Using the English language you could call what the N64 had volumetric water, unfortunately it doesn't qualify in 3D speak. The water that the N64 utilized was built by using polygons in a straightforward method and assigning different physical properties while you were inside that area.

<p>Volumetric fog is done in many different ways but one thing remains constant about it, how it appears in any are depends on where you are looking at it from, like real fog. For one simplified example of how this is done, think of creating a set of invisible boxes using polygons at various points and then covering them with textures that had varying levels of transparency. What level of transparency they were displaying would depend on where you were relative to the fog.

<p>The GameCube is capable of handling volumetric fog; pretty much any platform could utilize it. If the GameCube can support this using Flipper or if it has to resort to the host CPU is something that I am still trying to confirm.

<p><b>Dean:</b> Being a graphic designer, a 3d Modeller and animator, I've never heard of volumetric water in my life. It must be the wet version of fog... How can something, being digitally represented, be wet you ask? Thats for me to know, and you to find out.

<b>What is the use of the Hi-Speed Port and the Serial Port 2 for the GameCube?</b><br>
<i>-Anonymous</i></p>

<p><b>Ben:</b> Having expansion ports on the underside of Nintendo consoles is actually the norm, this generation the exception is likely to be that they will be used for something outside of Japan. The two serial ports will almost certainly be used for either a dial up modem or broadband adapter. The High-Speed port seems like it is a perfect place for a local networking device, although to date I have seen no confirmation of this being in the works. While a modem/broadband adapter is a likely addition, getting your hopes up too high for all of the connections under the Cube to be utilized will likely lead to disappointment. Many will recall the high hopes for the N64 DD that never materialized for the US or European markets.
<hr>
<b>I know you will get a ton of Square questions, but here goes.  A while back, Square announced <i>Chrono Break</i> for an unnamed console.  Do you think the unnamed console is the GCN?  I love this series, and I would love to see it on the GC. </b><br>
<i>-Andrew</i></p>

<p><b>Irate Static Stick:</b>  Let me quickly borrow Miss Cleo's tarot cards.  Your mother is a <i>leprechaun</i> and your father is an <i>uncooked pasta noodle</i>!  A scam, a fraud?  No, no.  For just $3.99 a minute I'll prove to you I'm legit.

<p><b>Josh:</b> Err...Ahem.  That's sort of a tricky question. At the time of the announcement of <i>Chrono Break</i>, I don't think Square had the GameCube in mind. The series of moves which would eventually lead to Square coming back to Nintendo had probably started, but the game announcement was probably unaffected by those moves. However, now that the deal has gone down, I wouldn't be surprised to see a port. Just don't expect <i>Chrono Break</i> to be a GC-exclusive. And don't expect Miss Cleo -- or Irate Static Stick -- to give you your money's worth. And I'm not just talking about seeing the future.
<hr>
<b>I wonder, with Nintendo and Square together again, does this mean we'll see Chrono games such as <i>Chrono Break</i> appear on GBA or GC?  Besides the obvious <i>Final Fantasy</i>, is there a chance we'll see other games from Square?   Also,  is there a chance for <i>Xenosaga</i> to come to GameCube?  If not, then can there be a remake of Xenogears for GameCube?</b><br>
<i>-Jason</i></p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> See the above answer, Jason; it applies to Square's other big-name franchises as well. Keep in mind, however, that both Sony and Nintendo could theoretically shell out some cash to snag exclusivity rights to a game for a period of time, such as the deal Sony made for the exclusivity rights for certain Namco games at the PS2 launch. For example, <i>Tekken</i> was a Sony exclusive...for one year. Now, it's fair game, if Namco feels like producing versions for other consoles.
<hr>
<b>I've never been a big fan of Square, but I loved Final Fantasy Tactics.  I'm excited to hear it's being ported to the GBA, but I was wondering...will Square release a sequal to it on the Cube or for that matter, any other turned-based-strategy game?</b><br>
<i>-Gimbo</i></p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> They may wait and see how it sells on the GBA, but if someone held a gun to my head and asked your question, I'd go with yes, a FF Tactics-type game is probably in the works for a next-gen console.

<p><b>Dean:</b> If we get another Square question I'm gonna go Cubed.

<p><b>Glen:</b> Shut up.  Please, just shut up.

<b>I'm getting rumors from nintendo and other places that Super Mario RPG is coming to GBA.  If you have ever played that it on Super Nintendo, you'll know that it had to have been the best games made to this date, with the exception of SSBM.

I've asked Nintendo two things.  "Is SMRPG coming to GBA?"  As usual, they replied, "We have no info on this game being a game right now."  Which 9 times out of 10 times, means it is a game.  I've also asked if the GBA had enough power and capabilities to run a Super Smash Bros. game. They said "yes".  What the heck does that say?!?!  YES!??  Well, they must have already known about the blue rose a month ago apparently, because that would probably up-the-anti and make it possible.  I don't know...what do you think?</b><br>
<i>-Jack</i></p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> I've heard similar rumours about Super Mario RPG, but unfortunately, I can't confirm nor deny them. Nintendo has been very secretive about its games in development as of late -- even more so than usual -- and this is probably due to the fact that they want to help cut down on having to continually delay release dates. If we don't know about a game, we can't bug them for a date. I would go so far as to say that a port of Super Mario RPG is likely, though.

<p>As for Super Smash Bros. on the GBA: yes, it is possible, but Nintendo would more than likely use sprites if such a game was in development (which I'm not convinced it is). Using polygons would probably distract from the action rather than add to it, as it wouldn't be nearly comparable to even the N64 version.

A Celebrity Filled Q&A: Priceless

<p>Nintendo has not yet announced the prices for their other accessories. Keep in mind that the prices listed here are suggested retail prices, so retailers, as always, are responsible for setting their own price.

<b>I was wondering, which Zelda game will be displayed at E3?  Some websites say the more adult version was the final decision, while others say the one with the cell shading (the cartoony one) was the final decision.  I am hopelessly confused, and I can't possibly wait for the unveiling of the game.  Can you please tell me which will be the real deal to be hitting the stores?  Maybe there are two Zelda games coming to stores...I really don't know.  Please enlighten me.</b><br>
<i>-Tift</i></p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> With all of the crap floating around on the internet about this topic, it's easy to be confused. Don't feel bad. That's why, right here and now, we're going to lay this issue to rest once and for all: the cel-shaded version of Zelda is <i>final</i>. The "realistic" version shown at SpaceWorld 2000 is, as far as we know, no longer in development. Such a game could come out eventually, of course, but trust me, the first Zelda game you'll be able to buy for your Cube is <i>definitely</i> going to be cel-shaded.

<p><b>Dean:</b> If you paid attention to the Miyamoto interviews, you'd clearly see the answer... Well, I hope so.

<p><b>Glen:</b> <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/britney.jpg">Hmm</a>...  Oh my!

<hr>
<b>Any chance of seeing a review of the Interact 16x memory card?</b><br>
<i>-Vlad</i></p>

<p><b>Glen:</b> Hey, any chance I'm going to get off my lazy ass?

<p><b>Glen:</b> No, no I'm not.

<p><b>Dean:</b> If you'd like to buy one for me and send it to me, I'd gladly review it. Here at N-Sider we don't get paid, that's two years in poverty folks! We're homeless, but we have a website. Go us.

<p><b>Glen:</b> Go us!  If only I had a pair of those fluffy pom poms and a tight skirt...

<p><b>Fran Mirabella XIV:</b> I do.  *prances around the street*

<hr>
<b>I'm just wondering if you guys are going by IGN's info about Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil coming to GameCube, or if you guys have been able to indepentently confirm this?</b><br>
<i>-Johnny</i></p>

<p><b>Josh:</b> Klonoa 2 is coming, but it's a ways off. Don't expect it anytime soon.
<hr>
<b>I am a massive fan of the ISS series of (English) football games and immediately noticed that ISS2 was going to be a launch game in Britain; which has ultimately made up my mind to buy the console. However I have read nothing about it in any magazine (online or paper versions) and I was wondering if you had any details of the game yourself.</b><br>
<i>-Jamie Leach</i></p>

<p><b>Glen:</b> Chances are, if you enjoyed the previous ones, you'll like this one.

<p><b>I</b>rate <b>S</b>tatic <b>S</b>tick: It appears I'm a celebrity.

<b>I live in Europe and I am thinking about buying a Gameboy Advance (a silver colored edition, probably Japanese) from an American online shop. The question I have is: will European games work with this GBA or is there a sort of territorial lock-out as with consoles?  I hope you can answer this question as nobody seems to know for sure.</b><br>
<i>-Guy Lauwers</i></p>

<p><b>Patrick:</b> Yes, you can play games you buy in Europe on your Japanese or American Game Boy Advance, as the system has no territorial lockout.

<p><b>Josh:</b> Why can't consoles be more like this?

<p><b>Dean:</b> Because that'd be too easy, Josh. Way too easy.

<hr>
<b>First off, just wanted to say, you guys are hilarious. Although you guys tend to get off topic. But yeah, good work...oh wait...I need a question...Hmm.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?</b><br>
<i>-Ken</i></p>

<p><b>Rabid Albino Penguin:</b> Oh, that's an easy one.  The penguin silly.

<p><b>Miss Cleo:</b> Yeah, mon.  I'm Cleo.  You're a Libra, aren't you darling?  Who are all these nosy people, these outside influences I'm seeing around you with the Moon card.  I want you to really remember the pill, alright.  I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.  I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.  Oh my goodness.  Is there a gentleman in your life?  Is he incarcerated?  Did he used to play football when he was in highschool?  Yeah, that's the daddy.  You have a good life.  Well, I know this doesn't make sense, but things always happen for a reason, don't you agree?  You're a Libra, aren't you darling?  Yeah, mon.

<p><b>Dean:</b> Hmm, thats a tough question. Here's my play by play analysis:<br>
A chicken and an egg are lying in bed.
<br>
The chicken is smoking a cigarette with a satisfied smile on its face and the egg is frowning and looking put out.<br>

Any Questions?

<hr>
<b>What the hell is wrong with you guys?!?</b><br>
<i>-Ben</i></p>

<p><b>Glen:</b> Indigestion.  It appears I ate Miss Cleo...

<p><b>Miss Cleo:</b> You're a Libra, aren't you darling?

<p><b>Dean:</b> I'm a nymphomaniac. Wanna get freaky?

<hr>
<b>I have a question about Super Smash Brothers Melee. I read an article on EGM that said you could unlock Sonic and Tails by getting 20 K0's or more in Cruel Melee. I tried it and got 20 KO's yet nothing happened.  Is it true or what's going on with those guys...after spending over two hours trying to get them nothing happened; I just wasted time. I want you guys to tell me if it's true. And I'd like to congratulate you for your great site, it rocks!!!!!!!!!</b><br>
<i>-Rigo</i></p>

<p><b>Glen:</b> March Fools!  Err...

<p><b>Miss Cleo:</b> Yeah, I'm seeing the innocence card.  Damn, mon, you're one gullible fool.  You're a Libra, aren't you darling?
