<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection FAQ</b></font></p>

<p>Although Nintendo's journey into the realm of online games is one that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendonline">dates back</a> to the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it won't be until November 2005 that we see Nintendo fully support the vision and provide it on a worldwide scale.  Nintendo fans enjoy interacting, communicating and sharing their hobby with others...  For a Nintendo fan, it's nothing short of a dream to one day battle characters in Pokemon, clash swords in Zelda, or stomp goombas in Mario with an individual on the other side of the country...or for that matter, the world.<br><br>  That opportunity will be available in just a few months time on the Nintendo DS handheld followed-up early next year on the Nintendo Revolution with the introduction of the <i>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</i>.  The <i>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</i> is the name of Nintendo's wireless service that will be implemented across its gaming platforms as well as across the world.  The following is a comprehensive guide for any questions you may have about Nintendo and its highly anticipated new service.</p>

<P><B>Q: The Nintendo DS is going online?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<b>Fact</b>: Yes, indeedy.  Although it had been rumored since May of 2004, Nintendo Co., Ltd. President <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</a> gave a positive answer to this question at the 2005 Game Developers Conference.  At the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo, the service was given an official name -- <i>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</i>.
<br><br>
<i>"I want to announce today that, following the groundbreaking work we have always done in connecting players, we will aggressively pursue Wi-Fi connections beginning with Nintendo DS."</i> - <font size="1">Satoru Iwata, March 10, 2005 @ GDC</font>
</font></blockquote><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-19-wifi.jpeg" border="0"></p>

<p><b>Q: Will Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection be compatible with the Revolution?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: Thoroughly, yes -- beginning in 2006.  More details to be announced soon.
</font></blockquote>

<p><b>Q: When will this service launch?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: The service will launch to the North American public on November 14, alongside the release of Wi-Fi compatible titles <i>Mario Kart DS</i> and <i>Tony Hawk's American Sk8tland</i> for the Nintendo DS.   In Japan, the service will launch on November 23 alongside the release of <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i>.  Finally, the service will arrive in Europe on November 25 with the release of <i>Mario Kart DS</i>.
</font></blockquote><br>

<p><b>Q: How much will this service cost?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: As far as we know, all Nintendo published titles will be free.  <i>"...we will remove the most important consumer barrier - Nintendo's Wi-Fi connections will be free."</i> - <font size="1">Satoru Iwata, March 10, 2005 @ GDC</font><br><br> Nintendo has however left the door open for other publishers to charge for online content in the future.  A game like Mario Kart doesn't require servers since the DS units speak directly to each other when the "match-making" is done.  Therefore, "match-making" has no cost associated with it.  If publishers wish to have more than a simple match-making service, they will need to create and manage their own network-infrastructure.
<br><br>
<i>"It's very low-cost to operate. But a Massive Multi-Player Persistent world-type of game is a very expensive thing to operate: they may decide to charge for something like that, it's entirely their option. But we will not take a percentage of what they charge. That's their business."</i> - <font size="1">Jim Merrick, August 8, 2005</font>
</font></blockquote><br>

<p><b>Q: How will we - in terms of equipment - wirelessly connect our Nintendo DS to others?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: Nintendo has stressed the importance of ease-of-use.  They have partnered with IGN Entertainment and GameSpy to bring this technology and network to the Nintendo DS.  In addition, Nintendo has partnered with <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/press/news-detail.php?newsid=129">Buffalo Technology</a> to utilize its AirStation One-Touch Secure System (AOSS) technology.  The technology will be incorporated into Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection device(s) including Buffalo's <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsconference/pho26.jpg">Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector</a> which can be purchased and attached to an Internet-connected PC in order to share the PC's online connection with nearby Nintendo DS units.  The device will be on sale in Japan for a suggested retail price of 3500 yen. The USB Connector works like this:
</blockquote><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-10-05-nintendodsinterface.gif" border="0"></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You plug the connector into your internet-ready PC.
<li>A window pops up that you click with your mouse.
<li>Your Nintendo DS can then connect to it as a Wi-Fi access point.
</ol>

The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector includes software that notifies users when their Nintendo DS devices are within range. Once the initial connection has been established, subsequent connection is automatic.
<br><br>
Nintendo said connecting using the Wi-Fi USB Connector will be done without the need to input an ID or password (these will be automatically generated and stored in your DS). Users who already own a wireless router developed by Buffalo (equipped with AOSS technology) or NEC (equipped with Raku Raku Musen Start technology) will also benefit from the simple connection process.  Meanwhile, connections to the Nintendo DS online service from home with a wireless router not already mentioned is rumored to require minor adjustments to its settings.<br><br>
<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-10-05-easysafefree2.jpg" border="0"></p>
<br>
Nintendo said the network would not be made available to dial-up Internet users. The Wi-Fi USB Connector is said to be compatible specifically with a "high-speed Internet connection such as cable or DSL."
<br><br>
For those lacking a high-speed connection and/or PC, Nintendo has said that 1,000 access points will be created throughout Japan at retail gaming stores and other locations.  Nintendo of America said it will similarly create several thousand Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection hotspots throughout the United States.  Nintendo also points out that DS owners will be able to use the 3,000 plus "FREESPOT" access points being set up by the Free Spot Council, a Japanese organization that works to expand the availability of wireless LAN access points throughout Japan and the rest of the world. Nintendo is a sponsor of this organization.
<br><br>
<i>"Every aspect of DS is designed to be friendly to all audiences. Therefore, Wi-Fi should be easy for everyone, too. Our goal is to make this process simple and seamless. Users shouldn't have to give it a thought. Wi-Fi connections will feel like local area network connections because they will use a common API. We will let DS owners enjoy Wi-Fi without the difficulty of entering an SS-ID or WEP key."</i> - <font size="1">Satoru Iwata, March 10, 2005 @ GDC</font>
<br><br>
On April 19, 2005, Broadcom announced it would provide wireless technology for Nintendo's next-generation gaming systems.  Read the full press release <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=697530&source=home">here</a>.

<p><b>Q: What happens if your network is WEP encrypted; how will you be able to use your DS on your secure network or another Wi-Fi hotspot that requires a password?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: Iwata said during his GDC speech, "Wi-Fi connections will feel like local area network connections because they will use a common API. We will let DS owners enjoy Wi-Fi without the difficulty of entertaining as SS-ID or WEP key."
<br><br>
Nintendo uses the name "profile" to describe the various locations that you will use to connect to Nintendo's service.  For example, one profile could be your home, another could be your work, while the third could be a Nintendo free hotspot.  If you play at home, you might require a profile that uses WEP encryption but doesn't need a username or password. If you play at work you might require a profile that needs both a username and password.  Each of these profiles must be set-up on their first use.  After this first connection, you will merely need to select which profile to use and it will then automatically detect the connection.
</font></blockquote>

<p><b>Q: Will the Nintendo DS require firmware upgrades via the DS network?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: N-Sider learned that all updates will be built into the software.
</font></blockquote>

<p><b>Q: Will we be able to browse the internet with the Nintendo DS?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: According to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=793">Jim Merrick</a> in an interview with <a href="http://portables.p-nintendo.com/articles/I-89-2.html">Puissance-Nintendo</a>, this is definitely possible.
<br><br>
<i>"...what's interesting to us is to make sure online is a natural extension of the game. So you don't go to a completely different user interface saying now I'm on GameSpy and I'm looking for somebody. It just depends on how it looks like in each game. In Mario Kart, you get there, set up a tournament and find somebody to play with, but you never really see a user selection on the screen. It's still visually part of the race track, the kart in front of you... Animal Crossing is a different type of a game. You don't really want people you don't know coming into your village and chumping down your trees, turning up your house. It's a very personal thing, so you go to the train station, you buy a ticket to get to somebody else's village taking the train. It's very much in the context of each game, even though we have a server somewhere which manages everything: we mask that from the user."</i> - <font size="1">Jim Merrick, August 8, 2005</font></font></blockquote>

<p><b>Q: What is Nintendo's philosophy in regards to online game playing?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: Put simply: <i>Easy, Safe, and Free</i>.  Reggie says Nintendo is working to overcome the current "macho style of online games."
<br><br>
<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-10-05-easysafefree.jpg" border="0"></p>
<br>
<i>"We believe that the consumer wants more in the area of community, and we are looking at how to deliver that. We think the online approach of today is a bit flawed. We think the consumer wants a better way. And that's what we're looking to do with Revolution. What I am saying is that with our next home console we will address the area of gamer community. You said "online." I used "online" as a description of a flawed business model. We are passionate about enabling our gamers to play with their friends [and] to play with others across long distances. There are a number of different ways to execute that."</i><br> - <font size="1">Reginald Fils-Aime, EGM</font>
<br><br>
Nintendo will provide <b>two flexible online systems</b> for games:
<ol><li>Only members on your "friend" list can join your game.
<li>Anyone from anywhere can join your game.
</ol>
Developers will ultimately have the choice on which method to implement into their games.  One example of a design was given for a 'competitive' game.  In this theoretical game, players would be given one of three options for opponent selection. (1) They will be able to play against friends they have previously registered, (2) play against random opponents of similar skill level, or (3) simply play against any random opponent, regardless of skill level.
<br><br>
In the case of the upcoming game <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i>, Nintendo will implement the "Friend's List" similar to that used for online Instant Messaging in order to avoid strangers coming into your town and causing havoc. You can manually enter in that person's name to give them access to your village, or if you've connected with them locally you can opt to add their name to your Friend's List for future online play.  Meanwhile, with <i>Mario Kart DS</i> players can choose to play with others using any one of the aforementioned options.
</font></blockquote><br>

<p><b>Q: Okay now, how do I connect with friends?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact:</b> You will acquire your username the first time you connect to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Service.  The Nintendo DS system will automatically generate a userID that you will never see (it is only necessary for the system to create your account for you on the servers).
<br><br>
A player can then use his or her account to register a game and receive a Friend Registration Key. The player then exchanges and registers the Friend Registration Key of another person they want to play with. They can distribute friend codes with others by phone/e-mail/online bulletin boards and use them to add their friends to their friend lists (which are kept on the server).  Friends can be added while your Nintendo DS is offline.  Therefore, every time you connect via Wi-Fi, the server checks to see if there's anybody who wishes to add you to their buddy-list.

<br><br>
<i>"There is no user identification or password that you enter. But each DS and each user on the DS is uniquely identified on the system. So it's very much like giving to someone your mobile number. We generate a kind of one-time password: say "Add me to your buddy-list, here is my thing". A number, a password, or something like that. When they go online, they find you and ask you to be added to their list. It's really like sharing your phone number with somebody."</i> - <font size="1">Jim Merrick, August 8, 2005</font>
<br><br>
As such, there is no established screen name for the in-game experience. Everyone could be named Link or Mario if they wanted.  Players are instead identified by their individual Nintendo DS unit and individual game -- not by name or password.
<br><br>
<i>"But underline there is a single identity which is used and we will allow you to connect that to your account on nintendo-europe.com or if you're in the US nintendo.com, so it can be linked together there. And you can look at your buddy-list, look at your high-scores, and compare, all through the webinterface."</i> - <font size="1">Jim Merrick, August 8, 2005</font>
</font></blockquote><br>

<p><b>Q: What software will support this online wireless play?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: "<i>What we are developing internally, and externally with a number of people, is very exciting to me</i>," Satoru Iwata told the audience at the 2005 Game Developers Conference.
<i>"Internally, we're developing Animal Crossing Wi-Fi. We chose this property for a number of reasons. First, it is one of those non-game games I mentioned; a form of entertainment that really doesn't have a winner, or even a real conclusion. And because of its unrestrained pace of action, it avoids wireless latency issues. Before, you could take Animal Crossing to a different village. Now, with Wi-Fi you can take it around the world."</i> - <font size="1">Satoru Iwata, March 10, 2005 @ GDC</font>

<b>Rumors/Speculation:</b> Rumors around the internet indicate that Square Enix is working with Nintendo on several wireless online-enabled software beyond <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</i>.  Another rumor indicates Nintendo is preparing a Wi-Fi Pokemon title as its flagship Nintendo DS release for 2006.  According to Satoru Iwata, there should be a large library of games taking advantage of the network since developers currently working on short-range wireless games can easily expand their projects to include wireless Internet play (there are even rumors that Electronic Arts has had DS online protocols/kits since September of 2004).
</font></blockquote><br>

<p><b>Q: What content, if any, will we be able to store online?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: N-Sider learned via an interview with <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=624">Tom Harlin</a>, Nintendo of America's public relations manager, that players will be able to store personal content, scores, and even levels.
</font></blockquote>

<p><b>Q: Will we be able to communicate over the network using voice?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: It's possible.  At the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Nintendo showcased the voice-over IP software <i>DS Speak</i> for the Nintendo DS.  Although Nintendo said it is a potential application, it has no current release plans.
<br><br>
<i>"Voice over IP is a very interesting idea, and there's a lot you can do with it. I don't think the DS makes a very good telephone. It was a technical demo and how we might incorporate that in games in the future, I don't know. But I see it as something we'd like to bring into a game, where communication plays a fundamental part of the game. We don't want to get into the IP Phone type of business."</i> - <font size="1">Jim Merrick, August 8, 2005</font>
</font></blockquote>

<p><b>Q: Will we experience lag while using the Wi-Fi service?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: Nothing is perfect however Nintendo feels there will be very little difference between normal and Wi-Fi connected gameplay.  Nintendo will be implementing error-handling in its own developed software to remedy any issues that may arise.
<br><br>
<i>"In terms of the graphic framerate, it will be the same, but there is the communication framerate to take into consideration. And that's dynamic: it's going to depend on the latency of the people you are playing against, which can be highly variable. If I find somebody who is only two hubs away, it will be easy and fine, but somebody in Tokyo via the whole world, then we have a latency with everybody. You have to balance the latency between all players.  In our games, we have to do some kind of error-handling and predicting. It's a good example with Mario Kart: if the kart is moving in this direction, it will probably keep moving into that direction: maybe we miss a packet of information, but each DS continues to draw that kart going into that direction till it receives a new TCP packet with the correct information. It works, the same applies to items."</i> - <font size="1">Jim Merrick, August 8, 2005</font>

<p><b>Q: Where can I find more information on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection?</b></p>
<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Fact</b>: More details can be found in November at the official website <a href="http://nintendowifi.com/">NintendoWiFi.com</a>.</font></blockquote><br>
