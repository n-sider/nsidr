<p>The Nintendo DS Rumble Pak, packaged with 2005's <i>Metroid Prime Pinball</i> in North America, is going to be sold separately in Japan at a cost of 1,200 yen (about US$10) through Nintendo's online store in that territory, according to Famitsu.  The Rumble Pak is also sold in Nintendo of America's online store for $9.99 as well as continuing to be bundled with <i>Pinball</i>.

<p>Famitsu also notes that the Pak is compatible with just three titles thus far: <i>Metroid Prime Pinball</i>, <i>Mario & Luigi RPG 2</i> (known stateside as <i>Partners in Time</i>), and <i>Puzzloop</i> (which we'll see as <i>Magnetica</i> come this June).  We can also confirm that the Pak works with <i>Super Princess Peach</i> as released stateside, but we don't know whether that was the case in Japan.</p>
