At GDC this week, Nintendo is calling attention to one very nice-looking WiiWare title that's slated to hit the download service the day of its May 12 launch: a Wii-centric platformer from Frontier Developments called <i>LostWinds</i>.<br />
<br />
Newsweek's N'Gai Croal interviewed Frontier's David Braben about the title.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Main character Toku controlled with the Nunchuk, wind spirit controlled with the Remote</li>
  <li>Sketching with the Remote creates gusts of wind&#8212;speed and shape matters</li>
  <li>A button modifies actions to do things like sucking up water and using it to water a plant</li>
  <li>Came from internal brainstorming sessions at Frontier meant to spur creativity</li>
  </ul><br />
Croal also inquired about demos and pricing; the latter was not yet set, but a representative from Nintendo present noted that they expect their promotional push to come not from demos, but from the <i>Everybody's Nintendo Channel</i>, launching soon in North America and Europe.<br />
