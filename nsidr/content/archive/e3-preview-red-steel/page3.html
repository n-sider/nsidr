<a name="q3"></a><b>Question: Is shaking the Nunchuk attachment to open doors intuitive?<br />
<br />
Answer: Yes.</b><br />
<br />
During the demo, I was instructed to shake my Nunchuk at doors to open them. I don't remember the last time I shook a doorknob, but I have to say what probably started as a gimmick in the game's development has turned into a great idea. Despite the fact that I'm just shaking the Nunchuk, it really does create an immersive feeling that I'm holding a gun in my right hand and shoving open a door with my left while still keeping my aim ready.<br />
<br />
There was also a moment in the demo where I could flick the Nunchuk at a table to turn it over and use it for cover. Was this a scripted event? In the final game will I be able to do this to any table? That is currently unknown, but I can say the feeling was awesome. I love the idea of using the Nunchuk's accelerometer for an action button of sorts. I remember in GoldenEye (my current favorite console FPS title EVER) the button to open doors was the same as the button to reload. I'm glad to see things like this will be coming to an end.<br />

Yes, you can indeed turn your hand sideways to hold your gun "gangsta' style" (that's sideways for all of us not in the know) and feel potentially cool. Obviously, this is merely a graphical effect and not something that mysteriously improves your accuracy or anything. It is, however, a sign of things to come. If the game's going to be so detailed as to include small little bonuses for the Wii Remote like this then what else do they have in store? Based on some previews of the game that I've read, there will be moments where your character will meet with a Yakuza boss, or trainer of some sort, and moving the remote down in their presence will cause your character to bow respectfully. What I love about Red Steel are concepts like this. Your character bowing to another is something that could easily be handled in a cutscene, but why allow that to be the case when the player does have the capacity to do it by him or herself?<br />

<b>Question: Does the speaker on the Wii Remote make a gun sound noise when you fire a weapon?<br />
<br />
Answer: No...at least, not yet.</b><br />
<br />
There is nothing to discuss here that is much more than speculation, but as no doubt some were wondering about it, I would like to confirm that as of the E3 demo the Wii Remote's speakers did not emit gun sound noises when you fired your weapon and likewise no sword clang type noises could be heard either. I hope that such a thing will be added for the game's release, but as of E3 '06 there was no such feature. At the moment we can only hope it will be included.
