<b>Question: Is swordplay directly controlled by the Wii Remote? <br />
<br />
Answer: No.</b><br />
<br />
When the innovative new controller for the Wii was first announced, many immediately wondered how it could be used to sword fight. It seemed a natural extension of the motion-detecting functionality. Being that most Nintendo fans are also rabid Zelda enthusiasts, it's hard to imagine anything cooler than directly controlling the mighty Master Sword and slaying Ganon yourself. As such, when Red Steel's sword fighting component was announced, it was a dream come true. Everyone wanted to swing a sword around and fight some Yakuzas. However, what many failed to realize is that Red Steel doesn't actually allow the player to directly control their sword in combat. Instead, simple gestures in the form of horizontal, vertical, or diagonal strikes translate themselves into your game character making the same strikes. But, for instance, if you wanted to spin your sword around randomly to look cool or hold the blade up to the enemy's neck (as a Nintendo Wii teaser video unintentionally suggests is possible) you will be disappointed.<br />

That is not to say that sword fighting isn't entertaining. On the contrary, I found it most enjoyable, except for the fact that the demo made the game incredibly easy. I was able to defeat most enemies in a few strikes while they failed to block any of my attacks. The final product, thankfully, will not have any problem in this regard. Whereas some reporters have viewed the sword fighting in Red Steel as a glorified minigame, I see it as a traditional gameplay concept with a more immersive and intuitive interface. Sword fighting is a fun and adventurous thing to do, and though Red Steel's swordplay may not offer the same intricacies as a real duel it is still a huge leap ahead of pushing a button to swing a sword. Given that the title is primarily a first-person shooter, it is far more understandable that the game will not have time to teach you how to actually sword fight; and since few gamers could ever learn to defeat a skilled ninja, it is more than necessary for the game to have simple gestures translated into far more elaborate attacks. Well...at least in theory. <br />

According to the team, the final game will have more complex moves that can be pulled off (stabbing, parrying attacks, and the like), but the demo only featured a few simple strikes. If the game releases in its current state, with sword fighting no deeper than it currently is, I admit that it would feel like a glorified minigame, but if Ubisoft delivers on its promises, I'm game.<br />

The feeling of the swordfight is very engaging thanks to the Wii Remote. As said, the demo allowed only simple gestures to affect the enemy, but even at this level the gameplay was very immersive. The fact that the remote is shaped almost like the hilt of a sword probably helped as well. The Nunchuk attachment is used to block with what appears to be a small dagger. You raise the Nunchuk up to block or parry. Being able to use the Nunchuk's accelerometer technology to perform this maneuver instead of pressing a button on the remote also builds up the feeling of immersiveness. I foresee some great things for Red Steel's sword duels if the game turns out as it should. The foundation is already there. All the game needs are some extra (but still intuitive) abilities and I will be more than satisfied.
