According to <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/682/682320p1.html">IGN.com</a>, Sega is developing an original Sonic the Hedgehog title for the Nintendo Revolution console. The game is said to take full advantage of the Revolution controller and is in development by a team under the supervision of Sonic creator Yuji Naka.  Therefore, the game is not the same Sonic (tentatively named Sonic Next-Gen) currently in development for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. This info doesn't come as a surprise; after all, the Sonic Adventure titles appeal to the Nintendo crowd and have sold the most units on the Nintendo GameCube.  Still, keep in mind Sega has yet to officially announce the Revolution version of the game.<br><br>

"SEGA has not announced its official plans to support Revolution," a spokesperson for the company told IGN. "We are committed to creating great game content for all viable platforms, so when Revolution rolls out, it would be a safe bet to assume that we will be there."
