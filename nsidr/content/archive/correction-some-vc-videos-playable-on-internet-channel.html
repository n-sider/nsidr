After we let you know that there were Internet reports claiming you <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2746">can't view</a> the Virtual Console video previews on Wii, it turns out... you can.  For many of them, at least.<br />
<br />
We've since verified that most of a sampling of a half dozen videos on wii.nintendo.com's <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/virtualconsole.jsp">Virtual Console catalog</a> are, in fact, viewable inside Wii's Internet Channel browser.  The experience isn't perfect; some videos play a few seconds and need to rebuffer (though this may in fact be a symptom of the connection used), and one video (Star Fox 64) played with no sound at all.<br />
<br />
Our sincerest apologies for any misleading impressions our previous report gave.
