<p><a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/top/miyamoto-reveals-wii-details-to-kotaku-173232.php#more">Kotaku.com</a> had the opportunity to speak with Nintendo producer <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=170">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>.  Miyamoto divulged some juicy details on player customizability and also software interactions between the Wii and Nintendo DS.  An excerpt is below.</p>

<p>"...During the interview Miyamoto dropped a few bits on us. First at all, Miyamoto says Nintendo has been talking about how to use interconnectivity between the DS and the Wii. (Naturally.) He said the technology to support this is already built into the console, but that they haven't decided how to use it yet, but they've got a few ideas.</p>

<p>Some of the possibilities include using the touch screen and microphone input from the DS to effect Wii gameplay. Another possibility, he said, is to be able to download content from your Wii to your DS, edit it, and then upload it back to the console.</p>

<p>Miyamoto said they weren't sure when this connectivity would be available, but that it would be at launch or very early on because of the tremendous success of the DS.</p>

<p>Miyamoto also mentioned is that Wii remotes will likely be able to be 'attached' to different members of your household&mdash;each person would have their own Wiimote. Nintendo's hopes are that everyone in the family will own their own Wii remote, each with a distinct look, and that people can just hop into a game with the controller&mdash;and the Wii would customize the look or settings of a game based on which controller turned it on the console...."</p>
