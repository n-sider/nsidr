Perhaps to make up for taking so long to bring <i>Super Paper Mario</i> to Europe, the European Virtual Console is getting the first game in the series before America.<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li><i>Air Zonk</i> (TurboGrafx16, 600 points)</li>
  <li><i>Paper Mario</i> (Nintendo 64, 1000 points)</li>
  </ul><br />
This brings the total number of VC games up to 111 in Europe.
