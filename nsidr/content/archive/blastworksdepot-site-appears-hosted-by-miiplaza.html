Those anticipating Majesco's <i>BlastWorks: Build, Trade & Destroy</i>, which releases next week, can have a peek around one of the game's features a little early, if they so desire: the BlastWorksDepot website is publicly browsable.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3595-1.jpg" width="140" height="68" class="image_styled" /><div class="image_caption_styled" style="width: 148px;">This guy "gives jon black nightmares".</div></div>The site, which will eventually be a repository for all manner of user-created content for the shmup construction set that is BlastWorks, has a small selection right now of bits and pieces which are apparently from those checking out the game early.  When the game does ship, you'll be able to register your Wii with the site, then upload creations to the site directly from your Wii and send others back to your system.<br />
<br />
You can check it out at <a href="http://blastworksdepot.com/">http://blastworksdepot.com/</a>; it's part of community site MiiPlaza.
