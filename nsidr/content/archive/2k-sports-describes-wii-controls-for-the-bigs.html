2K Sports, publishing label of sports titles for Take-Two Interactive, sent a press release revealing details on how the Wii version of its upcoming MLB game, <i><a href="http://www.2ksports.com/games/thebigs/">The Bigs</a></i>, will actually handle.<br />
<br />
Gamers will be treated to a full baseball experience, as 2K Sports claims that "players will experience instantaneous feedback with every motion on the Wii Remote whether they're batting, pitching, fielding, or running the bases." For batting, swing angle, timing, and pre-swing motions are interpreted by the controller, allowing players to aim where the ball will go, along with creating their own at-bat waggles. Pitching is handled by arm speed, wrist movement, and button selection, all coming together to throw distinct pitches. Directional motions of the Wii Remote and Nunchuck aid fielding and throwing, allowing "jumping catches, wall climbs, and double plays." Finally, while running bases, gamers will use a "drumming" motion with the controls, and if they choose to dive, they point the controls down.<br />
<br />
The Bigs is the first 2K Sports title on the Wii. The game is an arcade-like approach to the MLB license, featuring huge ballparks, more action, and special effects. Players will be able to go up to bat this summer.
