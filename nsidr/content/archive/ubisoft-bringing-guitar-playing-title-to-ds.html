Ubisoft has announced that it will bring <i>Jam Sessions</i>, based on Japanese touch-based guitar title <i>Sing & Play Guitar M-06</i>, to North American audiences.<br />
<br />
Jam Sessions' core mechanic is playing the virtual guitar with the touch screen, recreating the guitar sounds with digitally remastered samples from an acoustic guitar.  The title has a Performance Mode where players can sing and play along with included music, Tutorial Mode which gets novice guitarists up and running on the game, and a Free-Play Mode where players can simply play whatever they wish.  Also included: a feature to record and play back your performance.<br />
<br />
Jam Sessions (as M-06) was developed by Plato, and will be released in North America in June 2007.
