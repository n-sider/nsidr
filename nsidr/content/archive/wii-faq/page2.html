<P>Nintendo "Revolution" is the term the company originally used to describe its next-generation home console - or more appropriately, its post-GameCube creation. The name alone, shrouded in secrecy, conjures up all sorts of crazy and innovative ideas. <B>"Revolution"</B> brings us images of rebellion, anarchy and most importantly <I>change</I>. That was and is the overwhelming effect Nintendo is striving to incite upon us.</P>

<P>With its aptly chosen codename, Nintendo has made the gaming community aware of its intention to shake things up a bit during this coming generation. It's going to be an interesting journey -- and N-Sider will do its best to keep you up to date on the latest revelations of the impending revolution.</P>

<P><B><a id="wii01">Q:</a> What is the Wii?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: "Wii", pronounced like the word <i>we</i>, is the official name of Nintendo's next-generation (or as Nintendo dubs it, its <i>new generation</i>) home console. The new title was announced on Nintendo's <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/home.html">website</a> on April 27, 2006, just weeks before the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>

<p>"Wii" will be used to market the system to a worldwide audience. Nintendo said it chose this unique name in order to further differentiate its console from competitors Microsoft and Sony who are creating expensive, high-definition systems that focus on graphics over gameplay.  Nintendo's Wii is meant to be more inclusive, as in the word "we", to include traditional gamers, their families and friends, as well as people who've yet to pick up a game controller.  Nintendo's entire message, from the console design to the controller to the very name that describes it, is intended to be welcoming, create intrigue and expand the gaming audience as we know it today.</P>

<P>The Wii name faced initial backlash from the online gaming community.  It's suspected that Nintendo chose to announce it before E3 so that come the big day, the shock would have already worn off and people's attention would instead be drawn to what mattered most...the games.  Nintendo's strategy ultimately paid off.  Although not everyone has warmed up to the name, people have come to accept it for what it is -- different.  And different has been Nintendo's goal all along.</P>

<P><B><a id="wii02">Q:</a> What is the Nintendo Revolution?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: "Revolution" was the title given to Nintendo's preliminary next-generation home console. It is not the final name but rather its codename. It was announced on May 11, 2004 at Nintendo's 2004 pre-Electronics Entertainment Expo press conference, which took place in Los Angeles, California.  Revolution was used to describe the console both internally and within the media until a final name (Wii) had been decided upon.</P>

<p>Prior to the 2004 E3 Expo, several gaming websites and magazines referred to the codename of the console as "GCNext" (GameCube Next) and "N5" (Nintendo's 5th home console). Since then, there have been several unsubstantiated rumors regarding the console's final name -- "Nintendo 21" being the most popular. At the Tokyo Game Show on September 16, 2005, the Wii console lacked the prior Revolution logo (<a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-09-25-revolution_logo.jpg">One</a>, <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news_05-17-2005_revolution052.jpeg">Two</a>).  It was suspected then that by excluding it, Nintendo was preparing the final name and logo.</P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii03">Q:</a> How long has Wii been in development?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Nintendo officially states that preliminary development on Wii began immediately before the introduction of the Nintendo GameCube (Note: September 14, 2001 in Japan and November 18, 2001 in North America).</P>

<P align="center"><I>"As can be expected, our development teams were working on successors as soon as the original machines were announced."</I><BR><FONT size=1>- Satoru Iwata, Nintendo President<BR>Jan. 15, 2004</FONT></P>

<P>In May of 2003, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was willing to invest a significant amount of its nearly $6 billion cash reserves into the development of both the next-generation console and portable hardware. He said he plans to make the next consoles "...the greatest gaming machines ever." He also spoke about characters and franchises and stated that he plans to introduce new franchises and is hoping they will reach the success of <I>Mario</I> and <I>Pokemon</I>. At the time, he stated there is heavy development towards these new franchises.</P>

<p>Development of the Wii remote control began in 2003.  Iwata <a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20060525/117498/?P=1">revealed</a> in May 2006, "We initiated research on the elemental technology around 3 years ago, and had formed a task force team 2 years ago. Our software and hardware teams held joint discussions each week to explore possibilities. Interface tweaking is different from optimizing performance, for the former is largely subjective, and calls for actual testing. We created a multitude of prototypes."</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii04">Q:</a> What does Wii look like?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact:</B> Why, we're glad you asked.  The new console boasts high-quality materials and a smart, compact design, approximately the size of three standard DVD cases stacked together. It's almost portable... A <a href="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-06-14-revolution2.jpg">variety of prototype colors</a> were showcased during E3 2005 (the console will initially only be available in white) and the system will come with a silver stand so that it can sit vertically.  In addition, the console is said to be exceptionally quiet and consume little power.</P>

<P><B><a id="wii05">Q:</a> In what manner was Wii initially announced?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: While speaking to the audience at its E3 press conference on May 11, 2004, directly after introducing the Nintendo DS, Nintendo president <A href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=76">Satoru Iwata</A> candidly spoke for the first time about the company's next-generation plans.</P>

<P><IMG src="https://static.nsidr.com/features/features-082804-nintendorevolutionfaq02.gif" alt="Satoru Iwata, Nintendo Co., Ltd. President" align=right border=0> <I>"Different also defines our approach to our next home system. It won't simply be new or include new technologies. Better technology is good, but not enough. Today's consoles already offer fairly realistic expressions so simply beefing up the graphics will not let most of us see a difference. So what should a new machine do? Much more. An unprecedented gameplay experience. Something no other machine has delivered before.</P>

<P>The definition for a new machine must be different. I want you to know that Nintendo is working on our next system and that system will create a gaming revolution. Internal development is underway.</P>

<P>I could give you our technical specs, as I'd know you'd like that, but I won't for a simple reason: they really don't matter. The time when horsepower alone made all the difference is over.</P>

<P>Work on Revolution is well underway. When you see it you will be excited because you will experience a gaming revolution."</p></I>

<P><B>Fact:</B> Yes, according to Nintendo it is two to three times more powerful. However, again the company adds that in addition to increased graphical eye candy, there must and will be more.  Nintendo has stated that graphics are merely the admission for entrance into the next-generation.</p>

<p>After observing screenshots of Wii titles, its been concluded that Wii is slightly more technically advanced than the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><B><a id="wii07">Q:</a> What are Wii's technical specs?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Nintendo is not yet ready to divulge that info as it indicated at the 2004 E3 Expo.  Satoru Iwata said plainly, "I could give you our technical specs, as I'd know you'd like that, but I won't for a simple reason: they really don't matter. The time when horsepower alone made all the difference is over."</p>

<p>In March 2005, IBM and ATI confirmed that they have been making the CPU codenamed "Broadway" and GPU codenamed "Hollywood" for Wii respectively. In April 2005, MoSys, who supplied RAM for GameCube, said it would also provide the memory solution for Wii.  A month later at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, Nintendo revealed a wealth of information including:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>SIZE:</b> The console will be the smallest of the next-gen consoles -- it will be less than three DVD cases thick.  It can be placed in your entertainment center horizontally or sit in a stand vertically.</p>

<p><b>MEDIA:</b> Wii games will arrive on proprietary 12cm discs which can be dual-layered to hold up to 8GB of data.  The console is fully backward-compatible with the Nintendo GameCube allowing it to use the same controllers, memory cards and play GameCube optical discs.  Both GameCube and Wii discs will be inserted using a slot-loading drive on the face of the unit.</p>

<p><b>ONLINE:</b> The console will go online via Wi-Fi Connection (Nintendo has partnered with Broadcom to develop Wii's wireless networking).  Users will be able to download software from the Internet via the Virtual Console and WiiConnect24.</p>

<p><b>PORTS:</b> The hardware is SD Card compatible and will include 512MB flash memory to save data. It also contains two USB 2.0 ports.  Wii will utilize up to four wireless remote controls.</p>
</blockquote>

<P>Nintendo president Satoru Iwata explained Nintendo's technological philosophy in an interview with the Seattle Post Intelligence.  "Sony and Microsoft are taking the same approach for the future by making machines with powerful and sophisticated technology. Nintendo is taking a little bit different approach, and I think this is an interesting contrast.  Of course, we are applying advances in technology. But when you use those advances just to boost the processing power, the trade-off is that you increase power consumption, make the machine more expensive and make developing games more expensive. When I look at the balance of that trade-off -- what you gain and what you lose -- I don't think it's good. Nintendo is applying the benefits of advanced technology, but we're using it to make our machines more power-efficient, quieter and faster to start. And we're making a brand-new user interface. I think that way of thinking is the biggest difference."</p>

<p>Nintendo especially hopes to create a console that is easy to develop for.  Nintendo revealed that this new development architecture will accommodate both big-budget "masterpieces" as well as artistic, indie offerings. Nintendo says that development will not require a steep new learning curve. In this way, just like Nintendo DS, it's a place where the best ideas "not the biggest budgets" will win.</p>

<P><B><a id="wii08">Q:</a> Will Wii hook up to a television?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Yes, according to Nintendo Senior Managing Director <A href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=401">Genyo Takeda</A>, the Wii will be able to interface with both a television and a computer monitor. In June 2004 Takeda said, "You'll be able to play [Revolution] not just by linking up to a television but to a computer monitor as well."</P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii09">Q:</a> Will the console support high-definition?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: No, it will not support output in the accepted 720p, 1080i or 1080p high-definition formats. It will however support 480p (progressive-scan) and be compatible with component outputs.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a> told IGN.com, "Nintendo's Revolution [Wii] is being built with a variety of gamers' needs in mind, such as quick start-up time, high power, and ease of use for development and play. It's also compact and sleek, and has beautiful graphics in which to enjoy innovative games.  Nintendo doesn't plan for the system to be HD compatible as with that comes a higher price for both the consumer and also the developer creating the game. Will it make the game better to play? With the technology being built into the Revolution, we believe the games will look brilliant and play brilliantly. This can all be done without HD."</p>

<P><B><a id="wii10">Q:</a> Will Wii hook up to a PC?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Probably not.  Although Nintendo previously said it would have this ability, it has not given any indication since.</P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii11">Q:</a> Will Wii connect to the Nintendo DS?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Yes, according to president Satoru Iwata in a June 2006 interview with <a href="http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20060525/117498/?P=1">Nikkei Business Publications</a>.</p>

<p>Iwata explained, "Let's say your Wii is connected to the Internet in a mode that allows activation on a 24-hour basis. This would allow Nintendo to send monthly promotional demos for the DS, during the night, to the Wii consoles in each household. Users would wake up each morning, find the LED lamp on their Wii flashing, and know that Nintendo has sent them something. They would then be able to download the promotional demo from their Wii's to their Nintendo DS's. This will, of course, be possible in gaming stores too, but I think users will enjoy being able to do this within their homes. The key merit here is having promotional material delivered to your home, instead of having to go collect it yourself."</P>

<p>Futher connectivity uses are unknown at this juncture in time.</p>

<P><B><a id="wii12">Q:</a> Who are Nintendo's hardware partners on Wii?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: In December 2002 Bloomberg reported that Nintendo had agreed to collaborate with NEC on a system LSI that would serve as the core for the new console. Furthermore, in early February it was announced that Japanese chipmaker Elpida was negotiating with Nintendo to produce DRAM chips for use in the Wii console. Most recently, in March 2005 at the Game Developers Conference, Satoru Iwata announced that IBM is providing the Wii CPU codenamed "Broadway" while ATI is creating the GPU codenamed "Hollywood". The CPU is apparently called "Broadway" because Broadway, New York, is the capital of musical entertainment. The GPU is named Hollywood because Hollywood, California, is the capital of movie entertainment. President Satoru Iwata explains, "With Revolution, we are determined to create the new capital of interactive [video game] entertainment."</I> Perhaps coincidentally, IBM's headquarters are located in New York and ATI has a development facility in California.</P>

<p>It was announced in April 2005 that Nintendo would partner with <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2176">Broadcom</a> to develop wireless networking for the console.  In May 2006, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2189">Opera</a> revealed it would provide the software that will enable Wii to go online and allow users to surf the web.  For the Wii remote controller, it was also announced that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2163">STMicroelectronics</a> will provide the three-axis acceleration sensors and <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2156">Pixart</a> will provide the object tracking technology.  Finally, it was announced that <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2103">Freescale</a> will supply the CodeWarrior official Wii development tools to development studios worldwide.</p>

<P><B><a id="wii13">Q:</a> Will Wii use a standard game console controller?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: For the longest time, this was Nintendo's response:</p>

<p><i>"Controllers for current consoles have more than doubled [in complexity] from older console. They may satisfy the hardcore gamers, but they've become too difficult for more casual gamers.  For the next-generation console, we plan to introduce a friendly user interface so that, for example, a mother who's watching her child playing a game might say, 'Oh, I'd like to try that too.'"</i> - <font size="1">Satoru Iwata</font></p>

<p>On September 15, at the Tokyo Game Show in Japan, the Wii controller was finally unveiled in a keynote speech from Nintendo president Satoru Iwata.  You can watch the keynote in its entirety <a href="http://www.irwebcasting.com/050916/03/index.html">here</a>.</p>
</font></blockquote>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<p>The Wii controller is small, elegant and can be used with just one hand.  It's in the form of a wireless remote-control with a range of around 10 meters. A small sensor placed near the TV and a chip inside the controller track its position and orientation, allowing the player to physically move the remote to interact with objects on screen. For example, you can smack a tennis ball by swinging the controller, turn a race car by twisting the remote, or aim a gun by physically pointing the controller at your enemy.</p>

<p>Beginning at the top of the remote is a "Power" button to turn the remote on or off.  Below that sits a traditional D-Pad for up, down, left and right movements.  A large "A" thumb button rests on the face of the controller while a "B" trigger button hides on the back of the unit. Below the "A" is a row of buttons including Start, Home, and Select.  Further down you'll find a small speaker that allows a player to hear game noises up close and personal.  Two final buttons labeled "1" and "2" rest at the bottom.  When the remote is turned horizontally, you'll find it transforms into an old 8-bit NES controller with the D-pad under your left thumb and "1" and "2" under your right.</p>

<p>At the very bottom of the controller are four lights that represent which player it belongs to (1-4).  On the backside of the remote is a compartment for batteries.  The Wii remote will use two AA batteries (Alkaline or Lithium-Ion) to provide power for an as-yet unspecified amount of time. Finally, rumble functionality is built into the controller so players can feel the action.</i></p>

<p>With the 'Home' button prominently displayed on the controller, many have come to suspect the network will be a vital piece to the Wii console and that its interface will be just as intuitive and unique as the rest of the console.  The Wii Remote will contain 4kb of memory.  This can allow storage for little pieces of information such as personal game preferences or a user ID. For example, with the Wii Sports titles, you can store a graphic face on the remote for easy travel to a friends house.</p>

<p>Think that's all there is to it?  No way.  An expansion port on the bottom of the remote allows for add-on devices.  One such add-on is dubbed the nunchaku.  It's a joystick device with two trigger buttons attached to the remote with a cord.  Although the nunchaku does not detect depth, it does contain an accelerometer that senses vertical and horizontal tilt movements.  Together, the remote and nunchaku combination have all the same functions of current controllers (plus more).  Whereas you would previously press a button, on Wii your movements are literal.  Nintendo has said to expect many more add-ons for the remote.  It's also possible for the remote to be slipped inside another controller shell, dance mat, bongo, or other peripheral.  Nintendo has showcased one such example of this with its Zapper gun -- a shell in the shape of a gun encases the remote.</p>

<p>If you lack the imagination to put all this information together, we suggest you check out the <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/651/651334p1.html">video</a> Nintendo released showing a few of the ways players can use the remote.  Oh, but there's one last thing...</p>

<p>This is the controller Nintendo revealed will be used for the Virtual Catalog line of Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo, NES, Genesis, and TurboGrafx games.  It resembles a Super Nintendo controller with added joysticks.  It's a slick design with an obvious retro flair.</p>

<P><B><a id="wii14">Q:</a> Will Wii feature screens on the console or the controller?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: No. At a June 2004 analyst briefing in Japan, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said, <I>"We have no intention of making a two screen console akin to the [Nintendo] DS."</i> It was instead confirmed that Nintendo will allow the Nintendo DS to wirelessly connect with Wii. Connectivity is here to stay afterall and even Sony is supporting it with its PSP and PS3 initiative.</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii15">Q:</a> How will Wii "revolutionize" gaming?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: The system will, according to Nintendo, fundamentally change how games are played. The change will moreover not just be in the visuals, but in the gameplay itself.</P>

<P align="center"><I>"We invented the current way a console is played - in front of a television and holding a controller - but maybe that image will change."</I><FONT size=1> - Satoru Iwata, Nintendo President<BR>May 13, 2004</FONT></P>

<p align="center"><I>"The concept of a home system today is defined as hardware that you tether to a box, and you are tethered to it via a controller; we think that's an old paradigm."</I><BR><FONT size=1>- Reginald Fils-Aime<BR>January 01, 2005</FONT></P>

<P>Nintendo says it feels Wii will be a "paradigm shift" in gaming -- of which it hopes will bring back older gamers who don't play games anymore and also introduce non-gamers to gaming. Nintendo stresses the most "strong community" and "immersive games".  Nintendo likes to call this "All-Access Gaming".  It will be a combination of the Wii remote, Wii Channels, Virtual Console, WiiConnect24, easy game development, wide variety of games, and appealing interfaces that ultimately reign in this revolution.</P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>




<P><B><a id="wii16">Q:</a> What kind of controller peripherals can we expect?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Although Nintendo has not confirmed the release of any peripheral outside the nunchaku, Nintendo did give us a glimpse of one it could release in the near future.  The Zapper, shown at E3 2006, is a light gun device that encases the standard Wii remote.  Theoretically this combo could be used for a more life-like experience while playing a game such as Metroid Prime 3.  However, again, Nintendo has yet to announce it will actually release it.</P>

<P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Other potential peripherals might include a steering wheel, microphone, or sword.  Let <a href="mailto:news@n-sider.com">us know</a> what sort of peripherals you'd like to see.</P>

<P><B><a id="wii17">Q:</a> Will Wii go online?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Yes, as confirmed by Satoru Iwata at the 2005 Game Developers Conference. The console will include built-in Wi-Fi features and utilize the "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection" service upon its release. Wii will wirelessly connect to the Internet using Wi-Fi standards 802.11b and 802.11g.  In addition, for those who lack a wireless LAN set-up, a LAN adapter that connects to the USB 2.0 port will be made available.</p>

<p>Given the current trend of consoles, its been highly likely Nintendo would go online via one route or another. Nintendo's history of online ventures shows that the company is interested in the idea. More can be found in our article <A href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/nintendonline">NintendOnline</A>.</P>

<P>It's also very likely Nintendo will make an attempt at creating an entirely new way of connecting people. Nintendo's revolution may very well be in how it handles the gaming community -- in how it allows players to play across long distances <B>without</B> resorting to an online approach (fees, etc.).</P>

<P align="center"><FONT size=2><I>"We believe that the consumer wants more in the area of community, and we are looking at how to deliver that. We think the online approach of today is a bit flawed. We think the consumer wants a better way. And that's what we're looking to do with Wii. What I am saying is that with our next home console we will address the area of gamer community. You said "online." I used "online" as a description of a flawed business model. We are passionate about enabling our gamers to play with their friends [and] to play with others across long distances. There are a number of different ways to execute it."</I><BR>- <FONT size=1><A href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=990">Reginald Fils-Aime</A>, NOA Exec Sales/Marketing<BR>October 19, 2004</FONT></FONT></p>

<P>Mr. Fils-Aime has gone on further to say that there are things that have been published in technical journals that talk about how to deliver a sense of community that is different than an Internet-based online experience. "We will share much more come E3 [2005]", he said.</P>

<p>And so it was confirmed at E3 that communication will be enhanced by the free "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection" service. Nintendo revealed it is creating an environment where people can choose who they want to play with. In addition to providing gamers with the choice of playing with random strangers, parents worried about their children's ears being filled with explicatives every five minutes can utlize a special buddy list and choose to have them play games from Animal Crossing to Super Smash Bros. with friends, rather than being forced to endure the testosterone-filled services offered by competitors.  More details regarding the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection are expected to be revealed later this year as Nintendo prepares for the launch of the Wii console.</p>

<P>The final key to addressing community is the distribution of user-created content.  This will be accomplished through Nintendo's WiiConnect24 service.  More info below.</p>

<P><B><a id="wii18">Q:</a> How much will online cost?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><b>Fact:</b> Going online with Nintendo games is free.  Reggie Fils-Aime confirmed in an interview with <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-14-nintendo-qa_x.htm?POE=TECISVA">USAToday</a>, "We will offer online-enabled games that the consumers will not have to pay a subscription fee for. They'll be able to enjoy that right out of the box. The Wii console is going to be Wi-Fi enabled, so essentially, you'll be able to plug it in and go. It won't have hidden fees or costs."</p>

<p>Third-party developers will have the choice to charge players for their online games.  With Nintendo setting the standard, however, this is unlikely to occur.</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii19">Q:</a> What is WiiConnect24?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><b>Fact:</b> Nintendo announced a new feature of its Wii console at its E3 2006 press conference. It's dubbed "Wii Connect 24." This feature gives the Wii a 24/7 connection to an online network. The console automatically enters a stand-by mode that uses the same power of miniature light bulb. This means the Wii console can be permanently connected to the internet. This opens up the opportunity to developers to stream new weapons, new levels, and new characters to your Wii console even while you're asleep. People could also for example, visit your Animal Crossing village while you're away.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a specific example we are planning for," Iwata explains.  "Let's say your Wii is connected to the Internet in a mode that allows activation on a 24-hour basis. This would allow Nintendo to send monthly promotional demos for the DS, during the night, to the Wii consoles in each household. Users would wake up each morning, find the LED lamp on their Wii flashing, and know that Nintendo has sent them something. They would then be able to download the promotional demo from their Wii's to their Nintendo DS's. This will, of course, be possible in gaming stores too, but I think users will enjoy being able to do this within their homes. The key merit here is having promotional material delivered to your home, instead of having to go collect it yourself."</p>

<p>Further details are expected later this year.</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><B><a id="wii20">Q:</a> What are Wii Channels?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><b>Fact:</b> When a player turns on the Wii for the first time, a soft blue glow will light up the room and the WiiMenu will appear on-screen. You're probably familiar with the TV Guide Channel that you use when you want to see a list of what's currently on television. It's the exact same idea. Think of it as a homepage for what's available on Wii. From this WiiMenu, you have access to a variety of Channels. These include things from the mundane News Channel that gives you an interactive news experience to the necessary Disc Channel that allows you to play Wii games. More details can be found <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2422">here</a>.</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii21">Q:</a> What is this I hear about being able to download classic Nintendo titles?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: The console will have downloadable access to select titles originally released for Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Nintendo Entertainment System. Nintendo calls this "virtual gaming". The company plans to utilize pay downloads as the standard for this system however there is the possibility for many types of services including free limited-time downloads or bonus downloads for the purchase of new games.  It has been confirmed that other companies will also be able to offer their old software for download.  Sega will be offering its Genesis software while Hudson will be supplying its TurboGrafx library to the service.  Titles from the MSX will also be available.</p>

<p>Recently Nintendo commented that it may improve the graphics in some of its classic titles.  "We are doing several experiments, including working with the original Super Mario Bros., with the new technology," Iwata told EGM in an interview. "The game itself and the gameplay shall be identical, but the look will be different -- it's possible that with Wii we may be able to see the old games with new looks."</p>

<P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: If you've followed Nintendo's history, you may recall Nintendo experimenting with a similar idea on the Nintendo 64.  The 64 disk drive peripheral would have offered users a similar service.  In particular, Randnet and Nintendo created an emulator that would allow NES games to be downloaded for as low as $1.  This was partially in response to Sega and NEC's announcement of downloadable Genesis games for Dreamcast.</p>

<P><B><a id="wii22">Q:</a> What type of media will Wii use for its games?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2005-06-14-revolution.jpg" align="right" border="0"><B>Fact</B>:  Wii will support two disc formats. Instead of a tray, a single, innovative, self-loading media bay will play both 12-centimeter optical discs used for the new system as well as Nintendo GameCube discs. The 12-centimeter discs are the same size of a DVD and can be dual-layered to hold up to 8GB of data.</p>

<P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Nintendo will likely go for a proprietary format or use its WiiConnect24 service to check to see if games are legitimate copies. Nintendo has always been very guarded about piracy and there's no indications that this will change.</P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii23">Q:</a> Will Wii feature DVD playback or the ability to record media?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>:  On the standard Wii: no.  Nintendo initially said it would offer owners the <i>option</i> of purchasing and equipping a small, self-contained attachment to play movies and other DVD content.  DVD playback was later removed from the console because Nintendo felt it was an unnecessary feature.  Nintendo has always been a gaming company at heart and the inclusion of any other media is not something the company tends to place significant focus on.</p>
<p>However, in October 2006, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2500">a DVD-capable version</a> of Wii was revealed to be in development by Edge magazine and confirmed by Nintendo.  This hardware version is currently only slated for Japanese markets, however.
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii24">Q:</a> Will the Wii be backwards-compatible with Nintendo GameCube software?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Yes, as confirmed by president Satoru Iwata at the 2005 Game Developers Conference.  The Wii will be backwards-compatibile with GameCube software as well as peripherals including the Wave Bird controller, memory cards, Mario Party microphone, Dance Dance dance pad, and Donkey Konga konga controller.  But there's more to it. The console will also have downloadable access to 20 years of fan-favorite titles originally released for Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx, and MSX.</P>

<P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: Nintendo is known for its backwards-compatibility with its portable systems. Although Nintendo has dabbled with the idea with its home consoles, it is not something that until now, has ever become reality.</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><B><a id="wii25">Q:</a> What sort of storage options will be available on Wii?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Downloads will be stored in flash memory. Players will be able to store game and game data in 512 megabytes of flash memory. If this space is filled, users can transfer downloads to an SD memory card or use a PC to manage files. The company chose flash memory over a hard disk because it is more durable, reliable and cheaper. The flash memory could also potentially be used to save game data, update the Wii firmware, and download Wii demos.  Furthermore, N-Sider has learned that the GameSpy network will offer server side storage options for things such as personal content, scores, and even levels. The Wii remote control will also have at least 4 kb of memory to store little pieces of information such as personal game preferences or a user ID.  For example, with the Wii Sports titles, you can store your graphic face on the remote for easy travel to a friends house.</p>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii26">Q:</a> Have developers received Wii development kits yet?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Yes.  In February 2006, Reggie Fils-Aime revealed Nintendo had shipped over 1,000 Wii development kits to third-parties.  When asked about whether kits had gone out at E3 2005, however, Shigeru Miyamoto said no, "We have not sent out development kits to developers yet.  However, development kits for Wii are very similar to the ones for the GameCube. So we feel that the environments are so similar that they will be able to start development very quickly upon receiving the development kits for Wii."</P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii27">Q:</a> What is the cost to developers to make games for Wii?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Development kits have been confirmed to cost as low as $2,000 each.  This is significantly less expensive than other next-generation consoles which are said to cost at least ten times as much.  Furthermore, THQ president Brian Farrell estimated Wii game development costs are in the range of a quarter to half of that required for PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 development.  Ubisoft's Red Steel game for Wii will incur a development cost of approximately $12.75 million.  This means a game such as Red Steel could cost a PS3 or 360 developer between $24 - $48 million.  Small developers will also have the option to distribute their games cheaply via the Virtual Console.</P>

<P><B><a id="wii28">Q:</a> What specific games are in development and what developers are supporting the console? </B></P>

<P><B><a id="wii31">Q:</a> Does Nintendo have the experience to tackle the next-generation?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: Sit down son; Nintendo is the most experienced video game console manufacturer alive today and perhaps ever. The Wii will be Nintendo's 5th home console - starting with the Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom, moving to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom, and then the Nintendo 64, and ultimately reaching the present with Nintendo GameCube. This is compared to Sony who will be going into its third home console cycle and Microsoft who will only be introducing its second. Moreover, with the Nintendo DS, Nintendo will have also experienced five portable variations of its Game Boy line. Put simply, there is no company that has Nintendo's over two decades of experience. And that, young grasshopper, is that.</P>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii32">Q:</a> When will Nintendo reveal more about Wii?</B></P>

</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>



<P><B><a id="wii33">Q:</a> Can we look forward to playing great video games on Wii?</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=2>
<P><B>Fact</B>: At the end of the day, Nintendo is most confident in the fact that the software will define the success of the console.  "...software sells hardware," Iwata explains.  "People buy hardware to play the games they love. I agree with Steve Jobs, the head of Apple, when he says, "Software is the user experience." Software is the driving technology not just of computers, but of all consumer electronics..."</p>

<P><B>Rumors/Speculation</B>: We're confident in Nintendo's software position.  Not only will it be creating a console market that supports next-generation video games and next-generation control, it will also be home to retro games and retro gamepad control.  High-budget or low-budget.  Big or small.  No other console will feature such variety and no other console will provide developers with the flexible canvas necessary to turn even the craziest idea into a game.</P>
