<p>Jaleco Entertainment is receiving heat from some for using the source code of an open-source emulator for its <i>Jajamaru Jr.</i> Game Boy Advance release, according to Waxy.org and Slashdot.org.</p>  

<p>Similar to the Famicom Mini/Classic Series, Jajamaru Jr. is a nostalgic re-release for the Game Boy Advance.  Jaleco used an emulator called PocketNES to bring the title to the Game Boy Advance rather than developing its own to use.  Some people have since accused Jaleco of copyright infringement.  The programmer and creator of PocketNES however doesn't agree with those accusations.</p>

<blockquote><p><font size="2">"Yes, PocketNES is public domain...," he said.  "I wanted it to be public domain. This "Jaleco incident", in fact, is the very reason I wanted to make it FREE (as in public domain) rather than "GPL free" (strings attached).  Let someone take an idea, do something cool with it, and not have to hesitate because of legal nitpickings. If a company can take something that I made, and turn it into a product that other people enjoy, I'm all the happier for it. Why should I care if someone else profits off of something I made? It's already free."</font></p></blockquote>
