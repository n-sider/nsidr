<blockquote><font size="2">
Q: Mentioning the Brain Training products - there have been a number of those "non-games" products released in Japan which have proven very successful. Are we going to see all of those in Europe shortly?<br>
<br>
A: Yes, we will do. We don't have any timing on that just yet. We're still evaluating them - people have been trialling them in our European office, because you always have to check how things relate, and the response has been fantastic. Everyone's keen to market them here, and we've had a lot of people asking questions about them and showing a lot of interest. We think they're really positive.
