Nintendo Australia said it will place the Game Boy Micro on sale beginning November 3, 2005.  The unit will be priced at $149.95, which is the current price Nintendo sells the Game Boy Advance SP.  The Game Boy Micro will be available in five colours for the Australian launch. The Platinum silver version will be available everywhere, with four other special colours being individually released through specific retailers. Other than the standard face plate, every unit sold will come with an alternative face plate.
