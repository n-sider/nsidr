<p>"Inside Nintendo, we call our strategy Blue Ocean," explains Kaplan.  "This is in contrast to a Red Ocean. Seeing a Blue Ocean is the notion of creating a market where there initially was none--going out where nobody has yet gone. Red Ocean is what our competitors do--heated competition where sales are finite and the product is fairly predictable. Were making games that are expanding our base of consumers in Japan and America. Yes, those whove always played games are still playing, but weve got people whove never played to start loving it with titles like Nintendogs, Animal Crossing and Brain Games. These games are Blue Ocean in action. "</p>
