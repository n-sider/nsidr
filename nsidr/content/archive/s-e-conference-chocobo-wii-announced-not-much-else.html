Leading into this weekend's Square-Enix Festival in Japan, the company had a few tidbits for owners of Nintendo systems&mdash;but only one new title was announced, with updates on entries in the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series comprising the bulk of the news.<br />
<br />
First up was the new announcement: <i>Chocobo's Dungeon: Toki Wasure No Meikyuu</i> ("The Dungeon of Forgotten Time") for Wii.  For the tenth anniversary of the Chocobo's Dungeon series, the new entry will see the titular Chocobo in world called Vil, where people have lost their memories.  The game will include "something special" for fans of Chocobo Tales&mdash;perhaps a link-up to the DS game?<br />
<br />
Perennial work-in-progress <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates</i> for Nintendo DS was also shown off, and is to be playable at the Festival.  The story revolves around fraternal twins Yuri and Charinka, in search of a special crystal.  The single player game will follow these twins, who will be joined by two other party members; multiplayer works in both competitive and cooperative modes, utilizing the DS's wireless communication function&mdash;suggesting that perhaps the game will sadly not be playable on Nintendo's Wi-Fi Connection service.  A release date was given for Japan: August 23.<br />
<br />
Finally, a little bit more of Wii title <i>Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: The Crystal Bearers</i> was shown, but not much&mdash;just a short trailer reportedly running on the game's engine.<br />
<br />
More news may yet come out about Square-Enix's offerings over the weekend, but it doesn't seem very likely.  If we hear anything, we'll let you know.
