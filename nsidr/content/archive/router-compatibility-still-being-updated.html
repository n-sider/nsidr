<p>Just a heads-up for those of you seeking home hardware for use with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Nintendo appears to still be updating the site's <a href="http://www.nintendowifi.com/customersupport/supportedRouters.do">router compatibility ratings</a> page.</p>

<p>Since we first <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1507">got a look-in at the ratings</a>, Nintendo has both been expanding on the explanations as well as, it appears, doing further testing.  It's advisable that if you plan to purchase home equipment for WFC, you wait until you actually have a game in your hand.</p>
