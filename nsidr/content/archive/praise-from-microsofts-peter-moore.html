<p><a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a> has interviewed Peter Moore at TGS, and the Xbox VP has good things to say about Nintendo's Revolution:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I want to give kudos for Nintendo for its attempt at innovation with the new controller," Moore commented, saying that the new device would "bring people in that, as Iwata-san said, are either lapsed gamers or gamers that are intimidated by the complexity of the controller.</p>

<p>"We said at E3, we want a billion consumers touched in this next generation by our industry.  That was an industry message. Certainly, we can see Nintendo rallying to that cry and reiterating what Robbie said on May 16th; I heard the same words come from Iwata-san of Nintendo yesterday."</p></blockquote>
