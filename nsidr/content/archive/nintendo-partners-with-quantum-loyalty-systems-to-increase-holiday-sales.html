<p>Nintendo announced it will partner with Quantum Loyalty Systems to create a promotion to increase holiday sales of Nintendo games and systems.  Nearly 3,800 Game Crazy associates in 700 stores nationwide, will earn cash prizes for selling specific Nintendo products and achieving stated sales goals during the 2004 holiday season.</p>

<p><center><font size="2">"Ecount's custom prepaid Visa cards totally eliminate the payment distribution and management problems that typically plague sales incentive programs," says Matt Gillin, CEO of Ecount. "As proven motivators for sales teams, prepaid cards instantly deliver a true cash incentive that can be spent at millions of locations. And they're more secure and easier to manage, because there are no checks to write; no costly stop-payments for lost checks; and up-to-the-second online monitoring of sales performance by associate, store, product, or vendor. Ecount's prepaid cards are simply a better way to pay."</font></center></p>

<p>Each employee will be issued an Ecount's Visa- branded prepaid "Rewards Card", as it's called, that will have cash prizes applied when goals are met.  The cards (which will also feature the Mario character) can be used anywhere that Visa debit cards are accepted.</p>
