The <i>Art Style</i> games may have dried up and the <i>Flipnote Studio</i> excitement cooled, but there's still some pretty neat stuff on DSiWare from time to time.  I haven't been telling you about them as much as I would have liked to, dear readers, so I'd like to fix that little problem right now, if I may.<br />
<br />
<div class="align_right"><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=6497&view=screens&imgid=2"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/images/inline_images/inline-4-3960-1.jpg" width="170" height="255" class="image_styled" /></a></div>Let's kick off with the latest and greatest that I've been playing: <i>Pinball Pulse: The Ancients Beckon</i>.  Developed by pinball wizards Fuse Games, who are sort of looking like a Nintendo "second party" these days between <i>Mario Pinball Land</i> and <i>Metroid Prime Pinball</i>, this is&mdash;unlike their previous Nintendo-published efforts&mdash;a classic single table game with a ton of cool features.  I'm definitely <i>not</i> a pinball wizard myself, having never accomplished much on a real table, but I love the way this one feels and can easily play it for an hour.  Great value for the 500 points, and I'm hoping there's more <i>Pinball Pulse</i> in the works.<br />
<br />
On the non-game front I've also really had a fun time with <i>Art Academy</i>, though just <i>First Semester</i> right now&mdash;hopefully when I have more time I'll finish that one and give <i>Second Semester</i> a spin.  For a guy who can draw a little but is really no artist, <i>Art Academy</i>'s lessons are pretty cool.  They revolve around a pretty slick natural-materials paint program that comes with pencils, paints, and a photo grid that lets you draw from photos on your DSi Camera.  Fantastic package, and in my mind worth the 800 points.<br />
<br />
As amused as I was at the five 200-point <i>Domo</i> games, which I later learned were <a href="http://www.siliconera.com/2009/10/19/dsiware-domo-games-are-actually-gba-games/">based on an old GBA game</a>, they didn't turn out to be so great.  Their playability ranges from old-school rough to just bad.  <i>Hard-Hat Domo</i> is probably the best of the bunch.<br />
<br />
DSiWare may be heavily weighted towards Nintendo's own offerings, but those offerings are generally pretty good.  It's been a pretty cool service, and I'm curious to see what's around the corner next.
