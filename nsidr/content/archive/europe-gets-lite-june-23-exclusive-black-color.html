<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-2006-03-22-black_lite.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; border: solid black 1px; padding: 3px">Nintendo Europe announced early this morning their own release plans for the <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/hardwareview.php?hardwareid=30">Nintendo DS Lite</a>.  The system will sell for Â£99.99 (Â£10 over the classic DS's price) in the UK and &euro;149.99 elsewhere on June 23.  The most interesting aspect of the launch, however, is that European customers will be getting the option of a new black color exclusive to their territory in addition to the standard-issue white.</p>

<p>The Nintendo DS Lite &mdash; lighter weight, smaller, and with far brighter screens than its predecessor &mdash; has already been launched in Japan <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1819">to long lines</a> and has been steadily selling on the order of 100,000-200,000 units every week since.  The system <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1992">hits North America</a> June 11 at $129.99, the same price the classic version of the system sells for, which suggests the classic DS may be in for a price cut.  Unlike Europe and Japan, North American consumers only get to buy the system in its standard-issue white color.</p.
