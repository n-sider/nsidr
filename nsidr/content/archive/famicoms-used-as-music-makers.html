<p>Via Insert Credit comes the tale of Game Boy musician <a href="http://robotandproud.com/6955/">6955</a>, whose most recent project is assembling eight Famicom consoles into <a href="http://robotandproud.com/6955/EPK/">a rig controlled by a Roland TR-606</a>.</p>

<p>6955 has two "proof-of-concept" MP3s at the site (<a href="http://robotandproud.com/6955/EPK/6955-proof01.MP3">#1</a>, <a href="http://robotandproud.com/6955/EPK/6955-proof02.MP3">#2</a>); give them a listen.  A bit raw but pretty cool on the whole.</p>
