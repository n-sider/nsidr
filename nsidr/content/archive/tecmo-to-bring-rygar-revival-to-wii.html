At Tecmo's "Nite Out 07" event, the company <a href="http://ps3.ign.com/articles/787/787604p1.html">unveiled a work-in-progress</a> known as <i>Project Rygar</i>&mdash;reviving the Rygar franchise, originally seen on NES and in arcades, for Wii.<br />
<br />
Project Rygar features a new hero and new characters as well as "swing action", controlled by the Wii Remote.  No game footage was available at the event; only concept art and other concept work was shown.  Game footage is expected to surface later this year.<br />
<br />
Tecmo also revealed they are working on an entry in the Tecmo Bowl series, for an unspecified platform.  The company has lately been showing off <i>Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword</i> for DS, which was <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2693">announced  in March</a>.
