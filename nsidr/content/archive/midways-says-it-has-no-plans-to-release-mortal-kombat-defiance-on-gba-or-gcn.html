<p>N-Sider contacted Midway PR representative Karen Schachter this morning.  She informed us that Midway is not currently in development with <i>Mortal Kombat Defiance</i> for either the Nintendo GameCube or Game Boy Advance.</p>

<p>"No, there are currently no plans [to bring it to the Nintendo GameCube or Game Boy Advance]," she said.</p>

<p>The press release from Midway earlier this morning noted <i>Mortal Kombat Defiance</i> would arrive on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in fall of 2004.  The Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance were not mentioned. Their exclusion has now been confirmed to be intentional.</p>

<p>In 2003, Midway released <i>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</i> on the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy Advance.</p>

<p>Midway recently released its fourth quarter 2003 financial statements, in which it declared revenues of $30.1 million, down from $80.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.  Revenues for the year 2003 were $92.5 million, down from $191.9 million for the year 2002.</p>

<p>President and chief executive officer David F. Zucker said, "The operating, process, product development and marketing overhaul
we began during the second half of 2003 should result in a significant
improvement in our 2004 operating performance and positions us for
further financial performance improvement in 2005."</p>

<p>In 2004 the company said it hopes to find success by releasing content suited to a more "mature gamer".</p>
