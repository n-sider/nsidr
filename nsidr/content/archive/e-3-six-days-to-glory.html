<p>In the days leading up to E3, emails and phonecalls are non-stop and preparations are in the final stages of being complete. It's never calms down until you're on the plane headed to Los Angeles, but after those short five hours, it all starts back up again and the insanity rushes through your body, because you realize that it's here: E3. <br><br>This year will be no different, if anything, it will be more exciting than ever, more to see, more to do, visual and aural satisfaction will be all around.</p>
<p>In today's excerpt, we go all the way back to.. last year, from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/e3-2005-a-retrospective/3">Brandon's recollection</a> of the events of E3 2005.</p>

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><p>The next morning was a fantastic experience. We all went to a  Hollywood location, which I believe was the Kodak theatre. We were to  get in line for registration so we could go upstairs to the Nintendo  pre-show. In line, we all busted out our DS stuff and started to  pictochat. Nintendo's foresight couldn't have possibly imagined the  atrocities committed this day. Among the pictorial highlights:</p>
      <p>- Stick-figures launching groin-liquid at other things and phrases<br />
        - Swear words<br />
    - Penis</p>
    <p>During this time we also saw &quot;TYP&quot; from Planet GameCube. Lots of people  called him names and he vanished. Perhaps he was an apparition. Also  there was Adam Sessler. No, the television doesn't make him look any  stranger than you'd expect he looks in person. After this we went  upstairs and enjoyed free objects and drinks. We got into the Nintendo  conference and I was overwhelmed by people. We kicked their asses and  took their pictures. Highlights of the pre-show included the Reggie  remix (a loud music clip proclaiming very slowly &quot;My.. name is...  Reh-reh-reggieeeeeee&quot;), Shiggy's Nintendog screwing the brains out of  that G4 lady's dog, and Reggie not pulling a Glock out of his pocket  but instead pulling a Game Boy Micro. Then he pulled a Glock and shot  people with it. Only in the Glock it was just acid. The joke's on them!</p></td>
