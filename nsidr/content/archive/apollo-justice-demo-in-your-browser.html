Can't wait for <i>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</i>?  Capcom has the first part of the first case of the as-of-yet unreleased game <a href="http://www.ace-attorney.com/aj/">playable online</a> in Flash-enabled browsers.  You can even play it on Wii's Internet Channel.<br />
<br />
Apollo Justice heads for retail shelves on February 12.  It's a new story arc, so you don't <i>have</i> to play the Phoenix Wright games before you get it, but if you like what you see, you might want to consider checking out the previous titles in the series.<br />
