<p>Wonder what former Retro Studios' president Jeff Spangenberg has been up to since his departure?

<p>Well, it seems his new company conveniently named "Topheavy Studios" is producing a title for Xbox and PlayStation 2 called <i>The Guy Game</i>.</p>

<p>The game is said to be based on the "insanity that is Spring Break". It's described as having been shot on location on South Padre Island during Spring Break, and "challenges players to match wits with over 60 attractive co-eds, all of whom are set on showing off their best assets."</p>

<p>Ahem.</p>

<p>"I feel innovation is incredibly important in the video game industry. With The Guy Game we set out to do something completely different than what had been done before," said Jeff Spangenberg, CEO of TOPHEAVY Studios. "We feel that guys will be extremely pleased with the final result."</p>

<p>I can feel the innovation practically spurting out of Jeff.</p>
