In light of the Super Smash Bros. news reported <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=1567">yesterday</a>, it appears some new info has arisen.  New details were announced through a translation by <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/673/673312p1.html">IGN.com</a> from the Weekly Famitsu magazine, where director <a href="http://n-sider.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=982">Masahiro Sakurai</a> writes a blog.<br><br>

In his writing, Sakurai notes that development on Super Smash Bros. for Project Revolution started in May 2005, when he agreed to temporarily return to Nintendo to head up development of the game.<br><br>

Since then an un-named company was approached by Nintendo to assist in the game's development.  "Shigeru Miyamoto introduced me to a 'particular company' that had just finished development of a major game," Sakurai said. (Although unconfirmed, word has it that it may be Nintendo's Tokyo studio).<br><br>

In addition to Sakurai, this un-named team, as well as several HAL Laboratory employees who worked on the original title, Nintendo is also contracting several employees to assist in the development of the new Super Smash Bros game.  The group is housed in a newly acquired studio in Tokyo.  More updates are expected from Sakurai in the coming weeks.
