<p>In <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2081">May</a>, Opera announced development of a customized version of its browser that will make use of Wii's motion-sensing remote control. Today, in an interview with <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/articles/2006/08/17/exclusive_interview_opera_talk_wii">NintendoLife</a>, the developer echoed statements from earlier this year confirming the Opera software will not be sold as a separate product.</p>

<p>"The Opera browser is saved to the Flash ROM on the Wii console, and does not require a separate memory card as Opera for DS does.  The browser can be launched in only a few seconds, immediately delivering a great user experience."</p>

<p>In May, Scott Hedrick, executive vice president of Opera for Devices, said the same thing, "I can confirm that it will not be sold as a separate item, as it is for Nintendo DS."  Unfortunately, these comments have skirted the bigger issue of whether or not the software will be pre-installed or offered as a download.</p>

<p>The interview also confirmed that the Wii version of Opera will be based on <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/index.dml?ver=9.0b">Opera 9.0</a>.  It will include support for Javascript however, Opera declined to answer a question about support for Flash and PDF formats or the download of music and video.</p>

<p>Opera and Nintendo previously announced a partnership to bring the Opera browser to the Nintendo DS. The Nintendo DS Browser is currently available in Japan and scheduled for release in North America this December.</p>
