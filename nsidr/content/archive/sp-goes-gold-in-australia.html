Nintendo Australia and Toys R Us have announced that they plan to sell a unique gold-colored Game Boy Advance SP across the country. The deal would see the new unit being sold exclusively in Toys R Us stores nation-wide.<p>

"With the huge sales success we have seen with the Game Boy brand over the years and our recent sales of the Game Boy Advance SP, we approached Nintendo Australia to provide us with an exclusive colour to distribute through Toys R Us stores nation-wide, explains says John Redenbach, Merchandise Director, Toys R Us Australia. We are very excited to offer our customers the only opportunity in Australia to purchase this limited edition colour.<p>
