The company said the title and its publisher will be announced at a future date.</p>

<p>Andrew Oliver, co-founder and Development Director of Blitz Games commented, Were genuinely very excited to be working on the Revolution. Nintendos innovation over the years has trail blazed new concepts and the new controller is no exception. It will give people new ways to play existing genres but moreover we hope it will spawn altogether new gaming experiences."</p>

<p>Recall that Nick Dixon, design manager at Blitz Games, said he was excited for Revolution in an interview with <a href="http://wired-gamers.com/id12.html">Wired-Gamers</a> in October 2005.  "As a player, yes, I can see how it will make for some interesting gameplay," he noted.  "As a designer, I can also see that it will bring some interesting challenges and, perhaps, a few headaches."</p>
