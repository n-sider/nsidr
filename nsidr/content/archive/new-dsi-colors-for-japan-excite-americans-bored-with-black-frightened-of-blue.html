As is their wont, Japan is getting three new colors for the DSi come March 20&mdash;over two weeks before we even get <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/dsi-to-hit-u-s-shelves-april-5-at-usd-170-alongside-rhythm-heaven">our first two</a>.  Did I mention that they have <i>Rhythm Tengoku Gold</i> already, too?  Had it for months.<br />

Unlike with the DS or DS Lite, though, this Japanese hardware can't actually be convinced to speak English in its menus and such, so unless you're either fluent in the Asian language or are a masochist, you'd best be happy with what NOA is providing.  (I actually rather like the American blue, myself.  At the very least, I know that everyone else on staff here is revolted by it and so nobody will swipe it from me.)
