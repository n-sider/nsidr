<h1 align="center">Howard Lincoln Assassinated by Disoriented, Time-Traveling John Wilkes Booth</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/press02lincoln.jpg"></p>

<P>After an inexplicable journey through time itself, famed assassin John Wilkes Booth mistakenly shot former-Nintendo of America representative director and chairman Howard Lincoln in a hilarious mix-up that had crowds roaring at a local theatre.</p>

<P>While traveling down a D.C. area dirt road in 1865, Booth's stagecoach was rapidly accelerated to 88 miles-per-hour by an improbably powerful steed.</P>

<P>"I was in my coach on a bit of a ramble to Ford's theatre when out of the blue my fine horse here was spooked by some small woodland creature," said Booth, still chuckling from the zany turn of events.</P>

<P>Furthering the peculiarity of these events was a stray lightning strike which struck the twelve-foot long decorative pole Booth had recently installed in his vehicle.</P>

<P>"I felt warm and then some blue sparks were flying about -- pyrotechnics by the local boys I figured as I waved and smiled...</P>

<h2>Star Fox Assault Added to List of Punishable Texas Crimes</h2>

<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/press02assault2.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 5px;">

<P>Following an altercation in an Austin suburb Monday, the county sheriff and city council have criminalized Star Fox assault in an unanimous 10-0 vote.</P>

<P>According to sources, two women and a man were peacefully waiting in line at a local movie theatre when what one bystander called a "strange-looking, human-esque fox creature" reportedly emerged from a pile of underbrush and began to violently fondle the women after pistol-whipping the man with what the victims say looked "a lot like a laser-gun."</P>

<P>In addition, Jon Chow, owner and proprietor of nearby Chinese buffet-style restaurant "King Buffet" also noted a rather peculiar happening.</P>

<h2>Nintendo Console to Replace Handle With Trailer Hitch</h2>

<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/press02hitch2.jpg" align="left" style="padding-right: 5px;">

<P>Citing success with their handle-bearing totable Gamecube console, Nintendo has announced that their next-generation Revolution console will do the GameCube one better by featuring a full-sized, regulation trailer hitch.</P>

<P>"We feel that just as the handle created a sense of community and portability with the GameCube, the trailer hitch will open up a whole new dimension of travel with the Revolution," said Nintendo executive Shigeru Miyamoto. "Imagine taking a camping trip where you could have your Nintendo console with you, right behind the truck or trailer. This is something our competitors simply can't offer. Sony and Microsoft's systems are distinct in their lack of stylish towing options."</P>

<p>"The last issue of The Press erroneously attributed the phrase "crotch badger" to Mr. Satoru Iwata, when it was in fact uttered by our own Smith Gregg during a heated explanation of last night's drunken events.  The Press deeply regrets this error."</p>
