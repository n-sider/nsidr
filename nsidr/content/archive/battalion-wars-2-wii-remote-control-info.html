<p>Battalion Wars 2 is apparently only playable behind closed doors.  Fortunately <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3153075">1Up.com</a> had the opportunity to sit down with the game and share their feelings.</p>

<p>Although graphics are similar to the prior GameCube version, control, understandably, has received a drastic change.  Here's how things break down:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>The analog stick on the nunchaku peripheral controls your character's movement.
<li>The motion sensing Wii remote is used to aim and turn.  Performing a flick will result in a jump.
<li>Point at an enemy or object and press A to lock-on.  If you lock-on to the ground and move your character for example, you can strafe.
<li>Overall, 1Up says the controls can still use some polish but are satisfied with the progress made so far noting, "...When the game was running at its best, we found ourselves enjoying our time with the game quite a bit."
  </ul></p>
