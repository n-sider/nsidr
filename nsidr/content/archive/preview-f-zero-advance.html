In 1991 a newly formed EAD, led by Shigeru Miyamoto, were dead set on showcasing the Super NES's awesome Mode 7 and pseudo-3D effects. It decided to do it by creating a futuristic racer titled <i>F-Zero</i>. Not only was the game admired for its blazing speed, artistic look, and incredible mode 7 effects but also for being just flat out addicting.

Nintendo has surprised us again by announcing the third installment in the <i>F-Zero</i> series for the GBA. <i>F-Zero Advance</i> is a totally new game based on the classic Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 hits. The game will make its debut on Nintendo's 32-bit handheld with completely original tracks, pilots, and vehicles.

<i>F-Zero Advance</i> takes place 25 years after the Super NES game. The descendents of famous racers like Captain Falcon will now have their turn at the wheel as they break the sound barrier while flying off ramps and spin around corkscrews. The new pilots and vehicles will not be instantly accessible like <i>F-Zero X</i>; many of them will have to be earned through competition.
<p>
One returning factor confirmed is that Nintendo has decided to stick with the SNES's boost system over the N64's. The SNES boost system was based on receiving one boost per lap completed, while <i>F-Zero X</i> on the N64 allotted the boosts to be deducted from your energy meter. The systems changed gameplay drastically. On the SNES version, you would have to use your boost flawlessly, or you would throw away your bonus while your opponents blew by you. The N64 version allowed you to use several boosts as long as you could handle the car with the amount of energy left.

One of the more exciting features of <i>F-Zero Advance</i> will be the four-player link-up battle. That was the most painfully absent feature of the SNES version -- no two-player mode. Now, you can finally play with your friends. However, you won't have to share the screen with a buddy because you'll be able to play with three other friends, competitive or co-op, each with your own screen. 
<p>
Details are still sketchy but it appears that <i>F-Zero Advance</i> is quite far along in development. The game is scheduled for release on launch day in Japan, and should definitely be one of the first games released when the Game Boy Advance launches in the US during summer 2001.

As one of Nintendo's first big racers, this series should always be remembered and continued. If the GBA sequel can improve in the graphics department while featuring some awesome track designs and multi-player action, then <i>F-Zero</i> fans will be in gaming bliss.
