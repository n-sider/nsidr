PC World yesterday <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,131935-page,2-c,systems/article.html">unveiled their list</a> of the 100 best products of 2007. Coming in third: Wii, from Nintendo.<br />
<br />
Editors of the publication state that "with motion-sensitive controls and a slate of fun games for all ages, Nintendo really has something with the Wii."<br />
<br />
Nintendo beat out a wide variety of products, including the 80GB Apple iPod and Flickr. The only other gaming device to make the list was Microsoft's Xbox 360 Elite, coming in 18th. The Wii itself was beat by Google Apps Premier Edition and the Intel Core 2 Duo.<br />
<br />
Also of note: Wii was nominated the most of any product to be the reader's choice for product of the year, beating out the Xbox 360 Elite, which came in fourth.
