Nikkei published a survey that gauged interest in Japanese next-generation console purchases, according to Next-Gen.biz.  The survey concluded that 72 percent of consumers are "interested in buying PlayStation 3", 22 percent the Nintendo Revolution and 6 percent the Xbox 360. In addition, 60 percent of potential PlayStation 3 owners said they would buy the unit even if it cost more than 20,000 yen (about $200) while only 35 percent of potential Revolution owners responded positively to the same question.
