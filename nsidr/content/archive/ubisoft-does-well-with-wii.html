Ubisoft has revealed their results for their financial period ending with December 31, 2006, and the company <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/news/6790/1/Ubisoft_Reveals_Nintendo_Wii_Success,_Delves_Into_CGI_&_More">has beat expectations</a> of &euro;280 million by &euro;31 million.<br />
<br />
Explaining this, Ubisoft noted that 63% of its sales were attributable to the new generation of consoles, including 21% on Wii.  Ubisoft claims the number-one publisher spot for Wii in the U.S. and Europe (presumably behind Nintendo themselves), with market shares of 18% and 29.2% respectively.  CEO Yves Guillemot had this to say:<br />

We will also see new consumers&mdash;particularly women&mdash;entering the market, drawn by the remarkable success of the Wii and the Nintendo DS.</div></div><br />
On top of these successes, Ubisoft also said it will open a CGI studio in Quebec to produce short films, thanks in part to a Canadian government grant.  Very interesting, indeed.
