I admit I gave somewhat short shrift to <i>Brain Age Express: Math</i> in our DSi coverage.  Of course, I did note that I enjoy it, but I didn't delve into it as much as I should have.  Now that I'm on my fifth training day (yes, I skipped a few), I'm discovering that it's rather more than just a remix&#8212;perhaps it should even be called "Brain Age 3".<br />
<br />
I did mention that there are new training games in <i>Brain Age Express: Math</i>.  I still don't know exactly how many, thanks to <i>Brain Age</i>'s daily unlocking system, but I do have both <i>Sum Totaled</i> and <i>By the Numbers</i> available, both brand-new.  I also understand from reports that two more previously-released exercises are making a reappearance, and at least one more is brand new.<br />
<br />

The floating polygonal head of Dr. Kawashima told me today I could now play <i>Sum Totaled</i>&#8212;a simple game of adding up all the numbers on the screen&#8212;in "battle mode".  Not knowing what it was, I started it up, finding myself on the FIRST FLOOR of the HOUSE OF DOOM.  A stick hero with an answer square for a head stood his ground while monsters made up of numbers to sum came at him; scribbling the sum would defeat each monster.  The monsters got pretty creative, too; one large "boss"-like monster with six rotating digits to sum would slowly approach, requiring extra concentration, but before I could get my head totally around him, smaller monsters would swoop in quickly with double digits to fend off, breaking my concentration.<br />
<br />
On top of the new games, there's a whole new "themes" mode too.  Unlike the past <i>Brain Age</i> games, there's only one save slot now, but you can still get family and friends in on the action, especially here.  If you remember the sketches you used to do on a topic in the original <i>Brain Age</i> games, Themes is that again, but now with photography and voice-acting added into the mix; entries for each guest you give the game to are saved and shown in a gallery as well as a little slideshow mode that cycles through all the saved data.<br />
<br />
<i>Brain Age Express: Math</i> doesn't amount to a big shakeup to the formula, but then again, neither did <i>Brain Age 2</i>.  It is, I think, worth a look to those of you who were fans of the original games.
