Fish Tycoon will allow gamers to turn their DS into a virtual fish store. The game will stay active, even when the DS is off, letting players raise fish in real-time virtual aquariums. The main draw is that fish can be crossbred, and the resulting breeds can be sold in the store, raising money to purchase supplies, medicine, special chemicals, technology research, and advertising to bring in more customers. Starting with only a few fish, gamers must nurture and breed to attain the loftiest of goals, cracking the genetics necessary for the "7 Magic Fish." The DS version features 7 more exclusive fish than the PC version, allowing nearly twice as many fish types (over 750), along with all new 3D environments, tank decorations, and touch screen control.<br />

Fish Tycoon won the 2006 iParenting Media Award and ranked in the top 10 of all 2006 casual games for more than 40 straight weeks. It will release this holiday season with a suggested retail price of $19.99.
