Upon getting my hands around it, I blogged regarding <i>Contra 4</i>: "And so, my life was complete."  In theory, sure, and even mainly in execution, because Contra 4, or at least the limited demo they have of it, is pretty neat.  It plays just like classic Contra with the enjoyable flairs: weapon switching returns from <i>Contra III: The Alien Wars</i>, and we even have the option to drop our weapons out back to the ground for fenaggling.  There is also the addition of the new grappling hook, which serves to transport you up to the top screen.<br />
<br />
The giant vertical playing field is strangely reminiscent of the original Contra arcade game with its vertical orientation and adds another element entirely to the classic formula.  Weapons power-ups and eventually new platforms and level extensions begin to appear up there and must be reached with the grappling hook.<br />
<br />
Gameplay-wise, Contra 4 is just as unforgiving as its predecessors.  I died quickly and severely on my first several attempts and will undoubtedly be back for more today.  It's hard to believe but Contra is back, and with just enough twists to really make this one worth a look when it drops later this year.
