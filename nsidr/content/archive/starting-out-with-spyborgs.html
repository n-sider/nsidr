Capcom sent me a box last week with their Wii-exclusive brawler <i>Spyborgs</i> along with a holy-blast-from-the-past folder and pencil kit that looked like something I've not seen since my school days&mdash;which were, of course, the days when the brawler dominated the arcades.<br />
<br />
Having gone through some major changes since its early debut, <i>Spyborgs</i> has transformed into a game from that old genre, complete with 2-player co-op.  I've not yet been able to rope a second player in to accompanying me, but I have given the game an initial spin by myself, which lets me toggle between the two characters out of three  I picked when I started the level.<br />

<i>Spyborgs</i>' unique bit is Spyvision, which has you scan the area with your Wii Remote pointer for hidden objects (which shimmer a little so they're not <i>totally</i> invisible), then click them and swing the Remote upward to unmask them.  Usually it's a crate of sparks for health, points, or somesuch, but sometimes it's a computer you need to operate to progress or a "lost tape" that you can listen to in order to get some more background on the game's story.  It's best done when <i>not</i> in the heat of battle, by the way.<br />
<br />
Revisiting those brawler days have been fun, though <i>Spyborgs</i>' both-fighters-dead, you're-out M.O. on even its very short levels takes a little getting used to over the coin/continue action from those heady days of my youth.  Looking forward to playing more, and I'll let you know how it fares in my full review at a later date.
