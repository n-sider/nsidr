In an interview with CubedÂ³, Harvest Moon creator Yasuhiro Wada has confirmed that in addition the sequel to <i>Rune Factory</i> coming up on DS in Japan soon, there <a href="http://www.cubed3.com/news/7745">will also be a Wii entry</a> in the Harvest Moon spin-off series, which mixes monster-battling with farming.<br />
<br />
"We've already removed the subtitle of 'Harvest Moon' from the game title in Japan and Rune Factory is now independent game, working as an original series," Wada said.  "I can't explain the details, but a new angle will be added to Wii version and Rune Factory will grow up as an original series."<br />
<br />
Wada also gave interviewer Adam Riley a number of additional tidbits, including his thoughts about GameCube-to-Wii port <i>Harvest Moon: Magical Melody</i> and keeping producerly distance from projects under his jurisdiction like CING's <i>Project O</i> and <i>Killer7</i> creator Suda51's <i>No More Heroes</i>.  The original DS Rune Factory is headed to North American retail very soon: July 2.
