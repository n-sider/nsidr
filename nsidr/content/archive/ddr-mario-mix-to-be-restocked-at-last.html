<p>Nintendo of America recently sent word to folks who have been inquiring about instant holiday sellout <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=989"><i>Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix</i></a> that the title is slated to once again be carried at retailers within the next few months.</p>

<p>In addition, Nintendo is offering to those who have been inquiring of the game's status from their customer service department (like yours truly) an opportunity to pre-order the game directly from NOA, for shipment in late February/early March.  Quantities are said to be very limited &mdash; I was able to get my order in tonight; but if you got the mail, you may want to get yours in soon.</p>
