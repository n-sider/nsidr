<p><h2>Volume 2</h2></center>

<p>Welcome to the Rumor Mill, a biweekly feature at N-Sider that covers the latest rumors surrounding everyones favorite videogame company, Nintendo. For those unfamiliar with the Rumor Mill, here is a short history lesson of how it came to be. 

<p>The Rumor Mill was originally a forum thread started in the Events Board by user Jamesc395 to cover rumors relating to E3 2003. Unfortunately, Dean Bergmann (N-sider Technical Support) shut the board down do to lack of interest shortly after the topics creation. Once it became clear that the topic was not going to be revived, I (NR1) took it upon myself to restart it in the General Discussion Board under the name Rumors: The Pre-E3 Storm on May 7, 2003. The topic was an instant success; reaching three pages in eight days with over 90 comments. Shortly after, I started a more permanent topic on August 17, 2003 under the name <a href="http://forums.n-sider.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=1165">The Rumor Mill</a>, which can still be viewed at the very top of the General Board.

<p>Now that we got that out of the way, let me explain exactly how the Rumor Mill works. This page, which is the main page, is known as The Mill. This is the place where you can read about the latest rumors and speculation on Nintendo and its products. The second part, which is linked at the bottom, in known as the The Storage Room. The Storage Room is where you can locate any past rumors discussed in the Rumor Mill feature. 

<p>Now lets get this mill turning!

<p>This is a tough rumor to fully grasp. So many things have been said about new Mario game(s), that it is very difficult to keep them all clear, but hey, that is why the Rumor Mill is here!

<p>To start off, there are three major rumors relating to Mario that have been floating around longer than the sour milk in the back of my refrigerator, which believe me, is a very long time. 

<p>A classic 2D Side-scrolling Mario adventure
<br>Mario 128 moved to N5
<br>Paper Mario Returns

<p>Rumors of a Mario game returning to its 2D roots started around June 10, 2002 when a video was leaked onto the web that supposedly showed a new Mario title named Super Marios Universe for the GBA. 

<p><center><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/titlemariouni3.jpg">

<br>
<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/univmario.jpg">
<img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/univmariotwo.jpg"></center>

<p>As you can see from the images taken from the video, the game looked legitimate, however, it was not meant to be. Within days of the videos release, Nintendo and <a href="http://pocket.ign.com/mail/2002-06-10.html">several crack investigators</a> were able to certify the game as an elaborate hoax. 

<p><i>It's an incredibly believable video. Really. But there have been readers on the board that have done the sleuthing and have figured out that there's a distinct "Woo-hoo!" sound from the crowd that's the exact same "Woo-hoo!" from the crowd in one of our Spaceworld 2001 videos. I listened to both video's sound tracks, and the "Woo-hoo!" sound is in both videos. It's exact. 

<p>Which would indicate that someone probably faked a "conference" by filming a video wall, projected flashes to simulate the press, then "lifted" a few conference tracks with clapping and audio reverb...one of which was out of the Zelda video at Spaceworld 2001. 

<p>Awesome as that looks (and man, it does look good)...I think it's a hoax. That spinny Game Boy Advance thing at the beggining is so unlike what Nintendo usually does at these press events. And besides, if it WAS a press event, I wasn't invited...nor did I even hear about it. - Craig Harris</i>

<p>Even though the video was proven to be a fake, rumors continued the surface in message boards that a 2D Mario title was coming. The next major revelation to appear on this issue came sometime in <a href="http://www.cube-europe.com/news.php?nid=4671">June</a>, when Nintendo of Norways site listed 2 mystery Mario titles; Super Mario and Paper Mario. As strange as this sounded at the time, Paper Mario was actually confirmed as a real game on <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/434/434869p1.html">August 21, 2003</a>. To this day, it is still unknown as to whether or not Paper Mario is a port/remake of the N64 title or a brand-spanking new game. 

<p>So, that just leaves Super Mario unaccounted for. Could this be the long rumored 2D Mario or is the 2D Mario actually just Paper Mario? Was this game an error on Nintendos part? Well, <a href="http://www.jeux-france.com/Affichage_News.php3?Id_news=1515">Jeux-France</a> is now reporting that Nintendo Dream has received information direct from Nintendo that says a side-scrolling Mario is very much on the way. I guess we will just have to wait and see what Nintendo unveils in the coming months

<p>Finally, that mother of all Mario rumors is that of the fate of Mario 128. It is no secret that Miyamoto is working extremely hard on this title, yet little information is even known about the title. We do know that Miyamoto was disappointed with Mario Sunshine and that he wants to correct the problems that pledged it for Mario 128. We also know that he wants to make it easier for anyone to just pick up and play the game, unlike Mario Sunshine. 

<p><i>"As for Mario Sunshine, it would be very easy to take the Sunshine engine and create a sequel to that but really right now what we're focussing on is what really is fun, and how can we take that and find a way to make it accessible to a much broader audience." -Shigeru Miyamoto, May 2003</i>

<p>Most importantly, we know that the game is fairly primitive, at least in the graphics department, which is probably one of the reasons behind Miyamoto pulling the game from Nintendos E3 2003 line-up, the other being that Nintendo wants to keep its game-play mechanics a secret from their competitors. Oddly enough, it has been said on some occasions that Mario 128 has been in development longer than Mario Sunshine.

<p><i>"Talking now about Mario 128, we haven't come to the specific point yet where we have determined how the Mario character will look. I don't plan to create any shockwaves - I'm just always thinking about making perfect gameplay" -Shigeru Miyamoto, February 2003</i> 

<p>Recently, CNN Money had the chance to <a href="http://nintendo.gamerfeed.com/gf/news/4653/">interview NOAs George Harrison</a>, in which he reviled some juicy details about Mario 128. Harrison informed readers that the game is still in development; however, the platform it will ultimately launch on is in limbo at the moment. I would speculate that if there is a 2D Mario currently being created behind the scenes for GameCube, along with Paper Mario, then Nintendo will go ahead a push Mario 128 onto the N5. Nintendo is notorious with thinning out release lists, so this makes perfect sense when one considers Nintendos track record.

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> Unknown
<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> November 2001
<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Unknown

<p>When Nintendo announced on <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/432/432614p1.html">August 7, 2003</a> that the first game to star everyones favorite ape, Donkey Kong, would be a music game developed by Namco called Donkey Konga, gamers were less that amused. Many fans were anticipating the glorious return of the SNES- style platform adventure games that made up the Country series. 

<p>Back in early 90s, Nintendo entered into a prosperous relationship with a little known company called <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/index_content.php?page=profiles/rare.htm">Rare</a>. While Nintendo was preparing for the 64-bit Wars, Rare requested to get its hands on Silicon Graphics new SGI equipment that was being used for the N64s technology. While tinkering with kits, Rare was able to devise a revolutionary graphics method known as Advanced Computer Modeling (ACM). Nintendo was so impressed with Rares amazing abilities that they generously granted them the Donkey Kong license. Rare quickly put the DK license to good use when they changed the franchise into a full-fledged side-scrolling platformer that used the ACM technology they had developed. 

<p>The original DKC game became an instant success, which spawned 2 sequels. Ever since then, gamers have been clamoring for a forth edition in the Country series. Unfortunately, Rare took a different approach to the DK games during the N64 era that was received with scorn. Instead of super slick graphics with fast-pace action, gamers were given a generic looking 3D collecting game.

<p>Well, now that gamers have past through the dark tunnel and are now able to see the light at the end. Rumor has it the either NST or EAD is working on a DK that returns to the Rare formula. If Super Smash Bros. Melee is any indication of what gamers can expect, then they are in for a real treat. Outside of the above information, very little else is known about this title. According to <a href="http://www.gamecubeland.com/index.php?page=news&news_id=1875">GameCubeLand</a>, the title has been dubbed Donkey Kong Island and will sport 3D graphics, but play in a side-scrolling direction. Heres hoping that Nintendo doesnt disappoint.

<p>On a related note, <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/457/457856p1.html">IGN</a> is reporting that in the next edition of Nintendo Dream will inform fans of Donkey Konga that Nintendo is currently considering turning the game into a series in and of its own. Great news for DK fans! Not only do they have the Country series, but it looks like they will soon have the Konga series too!

<p><center><h3><b><a name="FFVII"><font color="405CC6">Final Fantasy VII for a Nintendo platform?</center></h3></b></a></font>

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> EGM
<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> June 2003
<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Unknown

<p>Will this rumor ever die?! This rumor has been accepted, then discounted, and then accepted again, and then discounted for a second time, and then finally branded as unknown. The only other rumor to even begin to rival the roller coaster ride this one has produced is the Megaton! So, how did this all get started?

<p>Rumblings of something happening hit the net sometime in June 2003 when <a href="http://www.ruhlemann.net/b2/index.php?cat=3">EGM reported</a> in their rumors section that a direct sequel to Final Fantasy 7 was in the workings for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). A firestorm of debate rushed Internet forums in an attempt to confirm this exciting, if true, news. Also, many Nintendo loyalist where trying to figure out why Square-Enix had bypass the GBA and instead opted for the PSP, which was only announced the month before. 

<p>It wasnt until July 8, 2003 when both Magic-Box and <a href="http://www.gamesarefun.com/cgi-bin/newspro/fullnews.cgi?newsid1057668326,12500,">Games Are Fun</a> reported that Square was considering porting Final Fantasy III to the Game Boy Advance. Now this had two different meanings at the time. First, this meant that the original story reported by EGM was incorrect, or second, that Square was reconsidering what platform they wanted to placed FFVII-2 on. Why port FFIII to GBA, but then make a FFVII sequel for the PSP? Something was definitely going on, however, no other details were ever released about a FFIII port.

<p>Finally on <a href="http://www.gamesarefun.com/cgi-bin/newspro/fullnews.cgi?newsid1062790732,15865,">September 5, 2003</a>, Game Antenna clamed that FFVII would in fact be at the Tokyo Game Show, which took place on September 26th through the 28th. The report was not clear as to whether or not it was a remake or a sequel, nor did it specify what system it would appear on. A few day later though, <a href="http://www.nintendojo.com/infocus/view_item.php?1062809248">Nintendojo</a> and <a href="http://members.aol.com/mips36/secret_page.htm">mips36</a> started to report that the game was going to GameCube! Somehow during the course of three short months, this rumor had changed the suspected platform it would appear on from PSP to GameCube. Where this rumor was heading, no one knew.

<p>More information spilt out of Game Antenna later that month that said this new FFVII would not be a sequel and that they couldnt talk about the platform.

<p><i>"I don't have anything in particular to write today, so just one note. 

<br>About [Final Fantasy] 7... it seems that it's not "7-2" or any kind of sequel.

<br>The platform and content is...

<p>Well, please hold on until there's an official announcement. When I first heard about it, I couldn't help but actually say "Whoa!" out loud. I'd imagine some people will be surprised, and some people will be like "So that's what they're doing with FF"...
(Who knows for sure, though...)"</i>
 
<p>From the wording of the message, one could clearly see that something big was about to go down with FFVII, but what exactly remained a dark mystery. If this wasnt exciting enough, the site was later told to remove the information! Does Square really have something to hide
More evidence came to light a few days later, when the Magic-Box reported that three development teams at Square were each working on a new project, and that two of these titles would be revealed soon with the third one coming at the end of 2004. Now, if FFVII were one of the first two titles, then that pointed to a GBA, PS2, or GCN release. However, if it were the third title, then that would reinforce EGMs original story that FFVII was in development for the PSP as a possible launch title. 

<p>The rumor hit its climatic peak the week of the Tokyo Game Show, when Jeux-France posted this image of a collectors bag that would be handed out at the show in a few days. 

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/ff7bags.jpg">

<p>If you look closely at the upper right-hand corner of the second bag, you will see the FFVII logo! This had confirmed months of speculation! A new Final Fantasy VII title was coming and it would be unveiled at TGS. As exciting as this was, it was quickly pointed out by fellow staff member Cory Faller that the silhouettes behind the text on the bag were the same as the ones found on a Project Shin-Ra website, which is a spin-off based on the FFVII universe, thus placing the true significance of the bag into doubt. 

<p><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/compareff7.jpg">

<p>When the Tokyo Game Show finally started on September 26th, gamers everywhere thought they finally had the answer to all these rumors. Square-Enix unveiled a brand-new Final Fantasy movie to be release directly to DVD called Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. All this speculation as to what platform it would appear on and whether or not it was a sequel or remake had been for nothing. The entire time it wasnt even a game! Though it seemed this was the end of all the FFVII rumors, it turned out to be just the opposite. 

<p>On October 10, 2003, <a href="http://ps2.ign.com/articles/454/454231p1.html">IGN PS2</a> reported in their Off the Record feature that Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children would come to market in a somewhat bizarre way. According to Japanese sources, the movie would either only be playable on PS2 players, or that it will come as a launch title for the PSP. 

<p>Now we find ourselves at the present day. <a href="http://www.gamecubeland.com/index.php?page=news&news_id=1866">GameCube Land</a> is now reporting that anonymous Square-Enix sources are stating that FFVII is still in the works for GameCube. What is really going on with FFVII? My guess is just as good as anyone elses.

<p><center><h3><b><a name="MP2"><font color="405CC6">Metroid Prime 2 Details?</center></h3></b></a></font>

<br><b><u>First Reported by:</b></u> IGNcube
<br><b><u>Date Started:</b></u> January 23, 2003
<br><b><u>Status:</b></u> Unknown

<p>When Metroid Prime was released for the GameCube on November 19, 2002 in the United States, it was greeted with open arms. The game, developed by Texas-based Retro Studios, marked a turning point in the franchises history. The introduction of the First-Person view caused many fans to become alarmed at first, but they soon found that the game was in good hands. With graphics that astonished gamers across all platforms, it instantly had players begging for more Samus.

<p>On January 23, 2003, sources within Retro informed <a href="http://cube.ign.com/articles/383/383512p1.html">IGNcube</a> that Nintendo had cleared the project and concepts where being formulated for Metroid Prime 2. Although nothing at the time was definitely known by anyone, including the programmers, one employee said that a multiplayer mode was being discussed and that the game was looking at a late 2004 release. 

<p>On February 4, 2003, semi-official word came from Nintendo via a link to Prime 2s <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/gamepage/gamepage_main.jsp?gameId=1699&showMe=1">profile page</a> that the game was indeed in the making. Not much more information has been released from Nintendo on this game, but they did surprise E3 attendees with a brief 10-second video clip that showed Samus being assaulted by what appeared to be Chozo. 

<p>Those are the confirmed facts, but I'm sure you're all more interested in the rumored details, arent you? Well, rumor has it that not only can players expect 4-player multiplayer, but also LAN based multiplayer! Even more electrifying are the whispers that it may contain an Online function as well! As unlikely as this sounds, it is entirely possible. It has been said that the now canceled Combat Car (also known as Thunder Rally) was 80% complete when it was shelved in order to get Metroid Prime completed and released. What is really interesting about this is that several team members reportedly had very high hopes to include an online mode, but since Nintendos policy doesnt conform to these plans, Retro was more than happy to cancel the game in order to release it at a later date with fully implemented net support! Of course that is just a rumor, but even if it isnt true, there is still always the Warp Pipe software

<p>Also, according to <a href="http://www.gamecubeland.com/index.php?page=news&news_id=1875">GameCubeLand</a>, the game currently holds the tentative name Metroid Prime 2: Hand of Fire. They do note that this name could change by the time of its release next year.
