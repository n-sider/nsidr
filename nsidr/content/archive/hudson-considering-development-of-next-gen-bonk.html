<p>Hudson Soft has voiced its interest in making a next-generation version of Bonk, according to GAF.  Staff of the publisher have posted <a href="http://www.hudsonent.com/viewtopic.php?t=72&sid=e84eb7b7159d8ef08e3e4bb406c8244f">artwork</a>, a <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bonkhudson">MySpace profile</a>, as well as a <a href="http://www.hudsonent.com/hive.php">poll</a> to gauge the interest of fans.</p> 

<p>Bonk's Adventure was originally released on  NEC's TurboGrafx 16 console in 1990.  The game followed the prehistoric adventures of a caveman, appropriately named Bonk, who used his bald head to paralyze enemies.  Hudson has confirmed that this title will be one of the first available for download on the Wii Virtual Console service.  Hudson is also developing Bomberman Land and the tentatively titled "Flight Game" for Wii.</p>
