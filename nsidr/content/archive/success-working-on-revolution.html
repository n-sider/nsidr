<p>One more for <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/a-third-party-revolution">the master list</a>: according to <a href="http://www.nintendoplayers.com/article.php?articleID=190">an interview at Nintendo Players</a>, Success Corporation &mdash; developers of the Ignition Entertainment-published <i>Zoo Keeper</i> &mdash; have at least some unspecified plans for Nintendo's yet-to-be-renamed Revolution.</p>

<p>In the interview, Success reveals that they are planning a puzzle game, adventure game, and a "dungeon RPG" for the Nintendo DS but are also considering a port of <i>Zoo Keeper</i> for the console (which would probably work quite well with the Revolution's controller), as well as entertaining plans that are "not releasable yet".  Success says they may be ready to talk about their plans this summer.</p>

<p>Success isn't terribly well-known outside Japan because most of their titles don't leave the country.  However, <i>Zoo Keeper</i> was picked up by quite a few early adopters of the Nintendo DS. Though it was literally a clone of the PC and PDA mainstay <i>Bejeweled</i>, its unique style and use of features like DS Download Play &mdash; not to mention its price drop to $19.99 later in its life &mdash; made it a fairly popular choice.  Perhaps a Revolution remake would be well-positioned as a downloadable title available through Nintendo's Virtual Console.</p>
