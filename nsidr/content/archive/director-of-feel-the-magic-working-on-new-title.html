Takumi Yoshinaga, director of Sega's <i>Feel the Magic: XY/XX</i> for the Nintendo DS, spoke at the Tokyo Natural Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, according to Gamespot.com.  He said that he is working on a new project.  "I am currently developing a title that kind of expands on the world [view] of Feel the Magic," said Yoshinaga according to a translation by Gamespot.  "I create my games with the hope they will make people happy when they play it.  I can't talk about the details yet, but I'd like to keep creating these kinds of titles, which will leave something [in the hearts] of the players. The [key] point is communion between the heart of people and people."
