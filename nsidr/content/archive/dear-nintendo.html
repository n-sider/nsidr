Dear Nintendo of America:
<br><br>
Please hire more employees to your localization and marketing departments so you can provide a steady flow of software to the Nintendo DS (and soon the Nintendo Revolution).  These titles are fully developed and have already released in Japan:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/ajsj/index.html">Jump Super Stars</a>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/ayaj/index.html">Gentle Brain Exercises</a>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/aosj/index.html">Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!</a>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/andj/index.html">DS Training For Adults: Work Your Brain</a>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/adjj/index.html">DS Rakuhiki Jiten</a>
<li><a href="http://electroplankton.com/">Electroplankton</a>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/abbj/index.html">Jam with the Band</a>
<li><a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/amjj/index.html">Yakuman DS</a>
  </ul>

Especially if you're going to promote the Nintendo DS as a device that can be played by everyone, then you need to release more games that are a clear example of that attitude.  <i>Super Mario 64</i> and <i>Metroid Prime Hunters</i> are great technological showcases and appreciated by your diehard fans, however these titles do very little to appeal to new audiences.  The DS has exploded in Japan because of its wide appeal.  However, due to the limited breadth of its North American library, we see the portable only crawling along and getting trounced by both the Sony PSP and Nintendo Game Boy Advance.  Although to be honest, I don't care about your competition.  My only care is that you follow through with your word.  Please give us these new experiences.  I think the initial success of <i>Nintendogs</i> is an indication that the market is ready...
