<a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum">GAF member</a> Kobun Heat points out that Nintendo has silently updated their press site indicating a delay of <i>Mario Party 8</i> towards a vague "Q2" release.<br />

Originally slated for March, Mario Party 8 will now likely end up releasing closer to summer, or even the second half of 2007, joining the ranks of <i>Metroid Prime 3</i>, <i>Super Mario Galaxy</i>, and <i>Super Smash Brothers Brawl</i>.<br />
<br />
Reasons for the delay are unclear, but many hope it is a result of possible WiiConnect or WiFi features.
