Perhaps in an honest HR mistake, Midway has posted a job opening for a "Level Layout Designer" on <a href="http://www.creativeheads.net/JobDetails.aspx?JobID=1774">CreativeHeads.net</a>.  The opening is for work on a next-generation "First Person Shooter" in development for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Nintendo Revolution and requests applicants be familiar with the Unreal 3 Engine.<br><br>

Some may recall that in November 2005 Mark Rein, vice president of Epic Games (creator of the Unreal 3 Engine) commented on how he would like to see the Revolution, if capable, use the engine.  
Rein noted, "...I think Unreal Engine 3 and Nintendo Revolution would be very well suited to each other...We don't know right now what the machine's capable of or not capable of, and we've built Unreal Engine 3 to a certain specification. If the machine can run the engine, it'd be fantastic to have it on there."<br><br>

It's known that the Revolution will be less technically adept compared to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.  Could it be that Midway's posting is inaccurate or will the Revolution indeed be capable of using the Unreal 3 engine? We'll wait for official word and let you know.
