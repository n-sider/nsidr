<a href="http://www.camphyrule.com">Camp Hyrule</a>, the online summer camp for Nintendo fans, has been cancelled this year. For the past twelve years at the event, fans could socialize with each other, compete for prizes, and have the opportunity to speak with the head honchos at Nintendo.<br />
<br />
All of that is gone now! In lieu of Camp Hyrule this year, Nintendo is going to hold a sweepstakes for a life-size statue of Link, from The Legend of Zelda. The sweepstakes begins August 13 and ends August 23.
