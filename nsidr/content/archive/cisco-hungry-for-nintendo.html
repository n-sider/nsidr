C|Net's <a href="http://news.com.com/Is%20TiVo%20next%20on%20Ciscos%20push%20into%20homes/2100-1036_3-6032452.html?tag=st.num">News.com</a> speculates that there is a possibility of Cisco being interested in Nintendo and several other companies.  Watch out, Cisco, unchecked hunger can be dangerous -- Subway's Jared has made testimony to this fact.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there's a price to pay for a successful company such as Nintendo.  Is Cisco willing or even capable of performing such a move? Over the years Nintendo has erected barriers to prevent such hostile takeovers.  Some may recall that Microsoft was interested in investing in the company at the beginning of this generation with Bill Gates even noting that he would be happy to acquire, <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=382">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a>, Nintendo former president's stake in the company if he was willing to sell.  In <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/08/26/news_6132040.html">August 2005</a>, Nintendo purchased back 1.5 percent of its stock to fend off any potential hostile takeovers. This increased Nintendo's ownership of its publicly issued stock to 11.59 million shares (8.9 percent).  Yamauchi owns an approximately additional 10 percent.
