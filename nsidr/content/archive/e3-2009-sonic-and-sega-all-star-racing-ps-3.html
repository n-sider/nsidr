I may have played the <i>Sonic & Sega All-Star Racing</i> demo at E3 more than anyone else at the show. I played it three times. Sitting right across from the packed <i>Bayonetta</i> demo, <i>Sonic</i> just didn't get a lot of action. None of the demo units ever had much of a line, and by Day Two the first words out of any Sega Rep's mouth were "it's a lot like <i>Mario Kart</i>." Yet, I had a blast. Is this a problem with me, or is E3 just too glitzy for a game like this?<br />

Granted, <i>Sonic & Sega All-Star Racing</i> is a clone of <i>Mario Kart</i>&#8212;That's undeniable. You drive around fantasy race courses as cartoon Sega characters and quickly find fun power-ups to shoot at each other along the way. The game mimics <i>Mario Kart</i> right down to its box-like item drops, crazy jumps, secret alternative routes, little beach crabs, and charging power-slides. Fortunately, I'm a big fan of <i>Mario Kart</i>; it's nice to see Sega (or any developer) try to rip off a Nintendo franchise and not fail miserably in execution. <i>All-Star Racing</i>'s controls work, and the game is fun. <br />
<br />
The demo I played had only four selectable characters, but I saw four others racing against me, and the "Blizzard Castle" course was from <i>Billy Hatcher</i>, so I presume there will be at least nine total characters, probably more. Sonic, Amy, Samba de Amigo, AiAi (from Monkey Ball), Dr. Eggman, Tails, Shadow, and Kit are the only characters I saw. Selecting your character is more like older versions of <i>Kart</i>, since there is no kart selection. Each character has its own custom kart. <br />
<br />
Only two race courses were in the demo: "Seaside Hill" from <i>Sonic</i>, and "Blizzard Castle" from <i>Billy Hatcher</i>. Seaside Hill is a typical Sonic level, with a lot of jumps, loops, and shenanigans going on. Blizzard Castle is not as imaginative as you'd think coming from <i>Billy Hatcher</i>, a game about a boy in a chicken suit who rolls around giant eggs that hatch into magical creatures. It was a pretty bland trek through an icy castle. Pick some better levels from your games, Sega. <br />

<br />
Power-ups are in plentiful supply. You find them in floating question mark boxes, like in <i>Kart</i>. The set of power-ups are all pretty standard, homing missiles, shields, speed boosters, etc. You can also perform tricks by pressing the shoulder triggers in mid-air. If you land a trick, you get a little speed bonus.<br />
<br />
The Chaos Emerald super power-ups are the only items worth noting. Like in <i>Mario Kart: Double Dash</i> each character has its own Chaos Emerald power, which is kind of like a Power Star or Bullet Bill from <i>Kart</i>. Sonic ditches his car and turns into Super Sonic; AiAi gets his ball back; and Samba de Amigo entices everyone he passes to line up behind him and party. Chaos Emeralds are a lot of fun, though I wish the rest of the power-ups were as imaginative. <br />
<br />
Racing is fun, but my favorite part of these types of racers has always been the Battle Mode, where you blast each other instead of race. I couldn't get a firm answer on if the game will have a Battle Mode, but several representatives I talked to said it is a possibility. Four-player splitscreen and eight-player online play is confirmed. <br />
<br />
There have been a lot of <i>Mario Kart</i> imitators over the years. It's practically pre-requisite spin-off for any popular cartoon-like franchise these days. Crash Bandicoot, Chocobo, Pac-Man, Kirby, Bomberman, Spongebob, The Sims, and even M&Ms have had kart games in the last decade. Sega had an older Sonic kart series called <i>Sonic Drift</i> on the Game Gear back in the 90s. None of them, except maybe Rare's <i>Diddy Kong Racing</i>, have been able to match the fun and replay value of the <i>Mario Kart</i> series. I don't think <i>Sonic & Sega All-Star Racing</i> is going to change this, but Sega isn't phoning it in. This is probably the best 3D game featuring Sonic, without Mario characters, in quite some time.<br />

The build I played was for PS3, and had a few frame rate issues that I hope are ironed out. It will ship to all three consoles, including Wii, next March.
