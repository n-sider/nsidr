An excerpt is below while the full transcript can be read <a href="http://palgn.com.au/article.php?id=3018">here</a>.

<blockquote><font size="2">
Q: Mario 128 will be released for Revolution then? <br>
<br>
A: Yes, of course! It's no surprise, but of course we will rename it, obviously. That won't be the only surprise of next year though. We based the Revolution around this new type of game. Mario 128 played a large role in the Revolution's conception, much like Mario 64 in it's time. But we won't just be focusing on Mario. We're working on some very impressive games which push interactivity to the max. Games of a new era. <br>
<br>
Q: The new Zelda, it's not really good news that... <br>
<br>
Q: Please allow me to interrupt you by saying that you will have to be patient, really. This will be, without a doubt, the last Zelda game as you know it in its present form. I worked on it personally, moreso than Wind Waker! I haven't invested as much into any game as I have this one. Our goal was to make the best Zelda game ever. The most rich/satisfying and melancholy. We've really improved it in just a few months. Everything's coming together much quicker. We may have some last minute ideas... <br>
<br>
Q: You're going to move it to Revolution? <br>
<br>
A: No, it is a Gamecube title.
