<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=17">Katsuya Eguchi</a>, most recently seen at E3 showing his team's efforts in <cite>Wii Sports</cite> and <cite>Wii Music</cite>, sat down for <a href="http://games.kikizo.com/features/ncl_nintendo_eguchi_iv_jun06.asp">a video interview</a> with Kikizo Games to talk about the announced Animal Crossing installment for Wii, as well as other bits and pieces.</p>

<p>As was talked about at Nintendo's E3 press conference, Eguchi has plans for Animal Crossing and WiiConnect24 (a feature of the upcoming console that can be used by games and the system itself to keep the console online while it's "off").  "One of the things that might be possible is while the player isn't even actively playing in their town, a friend of theirs could come and visit their town and, for instance, leave them a letter or a gift," he says.  He also said that he was considering cellphone-to-letter or email-to-letter gateways for the game.</p>

<p>Animal Crossing for Wii has been announced to be in development, but Nintendo has not fixed a target release date to it just yet.</p>
