The <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i> blog, maintained by SSB creator Masahiro Sakurai, has seen many updates since it began anew, including character profiles, items, stages, a song, and descriptions of game mechanics. This morning, though, is perhaps the most interesting update yet: Sakurai has finally revealed the controller for SSBB.<br />
<br />
Fans of both Super Smash Bros. and Wii have been arguing for some time now over which control scheme would be better: classic controls or Wii remote controls? Well, proponents of all control schemes can rest assured that they won't feel left out or disappointed. Four types of control were revealed today:<br />
<br />
<ul>
  <li>Wii Remote (held sideways)</li>
  <li>Wii Remote + Nunchuk</li>
  <li>Classic Controller</li>
  <li>GameCube Controller</li>
  </ul><br />
No specifics were given regarding any of the control schemes, but they will likely be revealed through the blog at a later date.
