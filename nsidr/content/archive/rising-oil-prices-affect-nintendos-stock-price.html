Japanese stocks fell upon concern that energy costs will hinder profit growth after oil prices rose to $60 per barrel.  According to Bloomberg, companies that rely on global demand such as Bridgestone, the world's largest tiremaker, and Nintendo, the world's top maker of handheld game players, will especially feel the effects of rising oil prices.  Nintendo lost 120 yen, or 1 percent, to 11,760. Analyst Tatsuyuki Kawasaki predicts the jump in oil prices will "dampen sentiment and put a lid on the broader market."
