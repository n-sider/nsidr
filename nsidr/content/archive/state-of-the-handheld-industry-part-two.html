NintendoInsider has posted part two of its "State of the Handheld Industry" feature.  The writers have spoken to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a>, Nintendo of America's vice president of marketing and corporate affairs.  Check out the interview <a href="http://nintendoinsider.com/site/EEkEkpkZFVzaqLdIut.php">here</a> while an excerpt is below:<br>

<blockquote><font size="2">
<b>Q: The Game Boy Micro supports removable faceplates; how does Nintendo plan on releasing these? Could we possibly see a My Nintendo tie-in?</b><br>
<br>
Initially each Game Boy Micro will launch with a variety of faceplates for purchase. After that, expect to see more designs both from Nintendo and others. Special offers, such as something through the My Nintendo rewards program, are always possible. We expect the faceplates will become real collectables, as fans try to maximize the ways that they can customize their Game Boy Micro.
