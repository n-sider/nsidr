Perhaps statements from <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a> should be verified more strenuously before we publish them.<br />
<br />
Kaplan's latest statement led us to <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2649">pronounce the GameCube dead</a> because she said Nintendo was not producing any more GameCubes.  However, when GamesIndustry.biz sought comment from Nintendo UK, they <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=22998">got a different story</a>.  "I can confirm that globally, Nintendo is still continuing production of GameCube hardware and GameCube software," a spokesperson from Nintendo UK told the site.<br />
<br />
GamesIndustry.biz notes that GameCube software, at least, has enjoyed a resurgence in sales thanks to Wii, which is backwards-compatible with GameCube software.
