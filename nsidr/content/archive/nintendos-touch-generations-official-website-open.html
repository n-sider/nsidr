<p>Nintendo of America has launched its <a href="http://touchgenerations.com/enGB/home/home.php">Touch Generations</a> website.  The site contains news and updates as well as information on Nintendo's line of Touch Generations software for Nintendo DS.</p>

<p>Nintendo has been promoting the "touch" aspect of the Nintendo DS in Japan with great success. It has been using the "Touch Generation" moniker to introduce games such as Brain Training, which appeal to people who generally don't play games. Nintendo of America will begin using the Touch Generation branding in the United States with the release of Sudoku Gridmaster on June 26. Nintendo will also refer to several already released games such as Trauma Center, Nintendogs, Tetris DS, and Electroplankton as "Touch Generation", however future titles that fall into this category will adorn a small "G" for Generations logo on their boxart.</p>
