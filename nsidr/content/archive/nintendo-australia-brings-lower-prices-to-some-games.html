Amid apparent discontent over Wii software prices in the land Down Under, IGN AU has news and words from Nintendo of Australia's Vispi Bhopti indicating the company is <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/755/755935p1.html">considering lower prices</a> for some software in that territory.<br />
<br />
The first title to get the treatment is the upcoming-in-that-territory <i>Wario Ware: Smooth Moves</i>, which will hit not at the usual price point of AU$99.95 (about US$79), but instead will be sold at AU$79.95 (about US$63).  Future titles slated for the lower price point include <i>Kororinpa</i> and <i>Wing Island</i> as well as one unnamed title.  Upcoming exciting truck game <i>Excite Truck</i> is known to remain at the traditional price point.
