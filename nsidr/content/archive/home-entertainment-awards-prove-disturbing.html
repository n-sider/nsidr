At the Home Entertainment Awards, held last night in Las Vegas, three game of the year awards were handed out for each of the gaming consoles.  Though the award ceremony is centered around home video movies, the video game awards were given out because of the outstanding business rental outlets do with them.
<br><br>
Without further ado I unveil the winners of the game of the year awards:
<br><br>
GameCube Game of the Year:  <i>Mario Party 6</i>
<br><br>
XBox Game of the Year:  <i>Halo 2</i>
<br><br>
Playstation 2 Game of the Year:  <i>Gran Turismo 4</i>
<br><br>
<i>Mario Party 6</i>?  I'm not denying that it's a quality game as far as the franchise goes, but game of the year?  As N-Sider's own Cory Faller said, "<i>Echoes, Four Swords Adventures, and Pikmin 2.  All spectacular.</i>"  As such we can only speculate that the award is based upon most rentals as opposed to the actual best game for the system.
<br><br>
<i>Gran Turismo 4</i>?  I do have a problem with this one.  This game was released this year and yet it is ranked among games that were actually released in 2004?  I have to say that I'm seriously questioning the validity of the Home Entertainment Awards.
