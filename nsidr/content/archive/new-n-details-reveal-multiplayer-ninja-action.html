As <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2797">recently announced</a>, <i>N+</i>, an updated version of the popular PC flash game, is in the works for the DS, PSP, and Xbox Live Arcade. In a press release yesterday, publisher Atari revealed some <a href="http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/news_press_release,115930.shtml">concrete details</a> on the game.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/n.html">N</a> is a puzzle platformer inspired by classics like <i>Lode Runner</i>. As a ninja, the player races for the goal, collecting gold along the way to increase the time limit. It is notoriously difficult and is recognized as having a very well-designed engine and great level design.<br />
<br />
The DS and PSP version, N+, will be the same type of game as the original with some extra features. For one, the graphics will be updated, although what exactly that will entail is still unknown. New levels are in the works, and the developers are holding a level-designing competition for all three versions of N+ at <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/sublime/">SUBLiME</a>.<br />
<br />
Just in case you don't win and you still want to play your own levels, the game will include a packed-in level editor. The real bonus? Player-created levels can be shared through both local wireless and online. There will also be downloadable content for the friendless.<br />
<br />
For those with friends, two multiplayer modes are in the works: co-op and competitive. Multiplayer is local only, but players can submit high scores online to be displayed on community leader boards. In the original N, high scores included a replay, but there was no word one way or the other for N's successor.<br />
<br />
N+ will be heading to handhelds this coming fall.
