<p>Oh where, oh where has the little blob gone, oh where, oh where can he be?  Word has been awfully quiet surrounding the cuddly pink-man's next adventure.  Is it still coming to GameCube?  Your guess is as good as mine, but in the meantime here's a look back at what <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/hal-laboratory-company-profile">HAL Laboratory's</a> game was like in May 2005.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nsidr.com/gameview.php?gameid=1006">Kirby Adventure</a> was a mix between traditional side-scrolling Kirby platformers and the fast-brawling action of Super Smash Bros.  Check out a video of the game from the May 2005 E3 <a href="http://media.cube.gamespy.com/media/716/716496/vids_1.html">here</a>.
The story was of the normal Kirby affair.  The Kirbster sets out to get the stolen Warpstar back from King Dedede. However, the gameplay (speaking from the perspective of being in 2005) brings something unique to the table.  Kirby teams up with several friends who lend their abilities and powers to collaboratively complete levels. A new attack system allows Kirby to gain power by riding on up to three of his friendly helpers. The more helpers, the more powerful the attack.</p>

<p>Here's to hoping we see you on GameCube, or at the very least Revolution's launch.</p>
