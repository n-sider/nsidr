Bolstered by increased production around 1.8 million units per month, Nintendo of America sold 350,000 Wii consoles last week&#8212;the week containing what's likely the most insane shopping day of the year, Black Friday&#8212;up slightly from the previous week's 300,000.<br />
<br />
NOA president Reggie Fils-Aime, who spent part of his weekend checking out Wii supplies at stores in Pennsylvania and Washington, notes that Nintendo's manufacturing partners can't beat their current rate of 1.8 million units, and told the Associated Press "A shortage benefits no one.  We're disappointed. This was all about how we didn't accurately estimate demand. We need to be more bullish about the potential for the Wii."<br />
