Additional details have come to light during the day regarding Nintendo of America's <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=2563">replacement program</a> for the Wii Remote straps.<br />
<br />
The company has said, via spokesman <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=161">Yasuhiro Minagawa</a>, that Nintendo will offer to replace 3.2 million of the wrist straps worldwide with a new model that replaces the 0.6mm-thick wrist strap loop with one that is 1.0mm thick.  Minagawa said the replacement policy will cost the company several million dollars.<br />
<br />
In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a governmental agency, is engaged in the voluntary replacement operation.  The CPSC puts the replacement figure in the U.S. at 2 million and is also reporting that Nintendo has recieved reports of broken straps, including "three reports of minor injuries not requiring medical attention"&mdash;all three of which occurred while playing <i>Wii Sports</i>.<br />
<br />
The CPSC advises customers seeking a replacement strap contact Nintendo at 800-859-4519 between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. Pacific time, or visit Nintendo at <a href="http://www.support.nintendo.com/">www.support.nintendo.com</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> A previous version of this story claimed the program was a "recall", when in fact the straps are being voluntarily replaced.  We apologize for the error.
