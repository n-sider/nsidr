<h2>E3 2005: Zelda Koi Pond</h2>

<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> was unarguably E3 2005's Game of the Show. What those of you at home may not know is that the game should also receive the award for Booth of the Show.  People were willing to wait in a line for over three hours to try out the new Zelda and check out the little world of Hyrule that Nintendo had created in its confines.  The booth was a mini-attraction with lights, smoke, ominous trees, scary skeletons and a really neat koi pond.  It dazzled spectators from entrance to exit.  If you're looking to read more about Zelda the <i>game</i>, youre in the wrong place.  This article is about just a single attraction in the Zelda booth -- the koi pond. </p>

<p>I've been on a media black-out for the upcoming Zelda game since last year.  No news, no screens, no video. If you're wondering why, it's because I am constantly immersed in game data, screens and video for nearly every video game in development.  I work at a video game website after all.  As a result, that element of "surprise" and "awe" when playing a video game for the first time no longer exists.  I miss that feeling.  By the date a game releases, it feels as though I've already played it.  That is why I go out of my way to retain that innocence for the Zelda franchise.  I don't expect this to make sense to everyone, just know that it works for me. </p>

<p>So now then, Zelda's section was a large part of Nintendo's booth this past E3.  Very hard to miss but fortunately enclosed within enough walls that I could miss it.  In the hotel room, I overheard the guys talking about some of the things they saw in the booth and needless to say I was intrigued.  "You gotta see this fish pond," I was told several times.  I was reluctant but after hearing their description I knew I had to see it.  Yes, even despite running the risk of spoiling something regarding the new Zelda...  I gave in and on the second day of E3 Mark, Josh and Ricardo led me to the back door media entrance (avoiding that crazy line) and with my eyes focused on the floor (rather than the bright plasma screens showing the new Zelda game) walked me over to these colorful lights dancing upon the floor. </p>

<p>The koi pond could be seen on the floor within the first room of the Zelda booth.  It was just prior to the hallway that led into the second room.   It covered a space of about five by ten feet.  It wasn't a real pond -- no H2O included.  Rather, it was an interactive representation of a pond.  A bridge extended over its length and when walked upon, each plank would drop into the water thereby causing ripples.  So too would the water ripple if walked on.  You could also wave your hand across the water and nudge the fish. </p>

<p>So what sort of technology makes this possible?  Is it a Revolution?  From information I've gleaned, this technology has been around for several years now.  In fact, I sent an email and confirmed it was created by a company called Reactrix.  Reactrix describes its product as an "interactive media display solution that enables people to physically become part of and interact with visual content."  Prior to E3, Nintendo contacted the company to provide the koi pond flair to enhance an already cool booth. To accomplish these displays, Reactrix uses a hardware and software platform incorporating a proprietary infrared technology, an LCD video projector, and a simple display surface such as a floor or wall.  Reactrix charges about $2,500 for a 30-second spot. </p>

<p>This is technology we'll likely be seeing more of in the future. McDonalds, Pepsi any many other companies have already used it to advertise their products.  Yes, it's mostly for advertising purposes.  The technology was originally created for an art project,  though it has since grown into a big business for Reactrix to serve the needs of advertisers, marketers, and entertainment venues.  Reactrix does displays for the floor, wall or tabletop.  They say their technology is all about creating a memorable interaction with the brand and venue.  The internet was abuzz during E3, "OMG!  InTErActIve FiSHy PoND!".  People were even going so far as to believe this was Nintendo's "Revolution".  I think it's clear that Nintendo and Reactrix accomplished their goals of building some awareness and making the Zelda booth a memorable one.   So this article's purpose is to not only dispel any belief that this is Nintendo's Revolution, but to also make everyone aware of technology that is, for lack of a better word, ...neat. </p>

<p>Reactrix works like this.  The system draws Reactrix Media content from Reactrix's computers over a typical high-speed Internet connection which is fed into a high-end projector that projects a layered image on the floor.  A network-connected hidden camera is also installed that captures, at 30 frames per second, the infrared spectrum around a person's body as he or she moves (or stands still). Meanwhile, the program determines how images would react to the person's movement and projects responding images instantly  -- whether theyre rippling water, scattering fish, or transforming the bridge.  The camera is accompanied by near-infrared LED clusters, which invisibly illuminate the screen/floor even in dark rooms such as the Zelda booth.  Overall, the technology has no latency, works in most indoor lighting conditions and responds to users hand, foot, or body motions.  </p>

<p>It's already interactive entertainment -- no different than a video game.  However, don't expect this technology to appear in home applications anytime soon... if ever.  The cost constraints (remember $2,500 for a 30-second spot) are out of my and your league.  Plus the equipment needed -- projectors, cameras, LED clusters -- are far too complicated for Joe-consumer to set up.  It turned out to be an effective advertisement tool.  It definitely got our attention.  So props to Nintendo for including it in its booth and a pat on the back to Reactrix for creating it.  Really, don't be at all surprised if you come across one of these displays on the floor of your local mall. </p>

<p>Nintendo's advertising for <i>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</i> has only just begun.  We'll be sure to keep you up to date on it all.
