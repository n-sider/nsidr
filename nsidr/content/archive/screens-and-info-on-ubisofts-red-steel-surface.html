<p>You read it right, folks -- the first <a href="http://www.endangeredgamer.blogspot.com/">screenshots</a> and info on Ubisoft's exclusive shooter for Nintendo Revolution have surfaced, courtesy of the good folks at <i>Game Informer</i>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://static.nsidr.com/media/news-04-07-2006-redsteel.jpg"></p>

<p>This <i>world-exclusive</i> (as it so aptly called on the mag's cover) touches on various aspects of the story and control style, such as tilting the angle of in-game weapons via real-world actions in 3D space. From the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>While we didn't get to play through a full level populated with enemies, we did try to complete the shooting range challenges as quickly as possible to put the team's claim about controller speed and accuracy to the test. Unlike most console games, we found <i>Red Steel</i> more enjoyable to play while standing up -- with the controller's movement-tracking abilities, we felt more natural playing while standing. The longer we played with it, the more natural it felt, and the more quickly we mowed down the targets.</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems Game Informer's initial impressions of the title, control-wise, relate closely to a mouse and keyboard setup, as was expected. For those who expressed concerns regarding the ability to straffe in FPS games following the controller's unveiling at TGS 2005, the next bit of this article may be of interest to you:</p>

<blockquote><p>Straffing around a target is incredibly easy, as keeping the controller pointed at an object while moving with the analog stick keeps you focused on your target.</p></blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to list other areas of control unlike any other explored in the console world, to date. This includes throwing grenades using both over-hand and under-hand motions -- players simply act as if they're physically throwing a ball -- or pushing objects over by moving the controller forward (towards the screen).</p>

<p><i>Red Steel</i> is being developed by Ubisoft Paris; their Montreal division is responsible for such block-busters as <i>Prince of Persia</i>, <i>Ghost Recon</i>, <i>Far Cry Instincts</i>, and <i>Splinter Cell</i>. Game Informer plans to have this issue available through their <a href="http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200604/N06.0407.1251.24078.htm">online page</a>, April 20th.</p>
