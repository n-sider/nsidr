In <a href="http://biz.gamedaily.com/industry/feature/?id=15301&page=4">an interview</a> with GameDaily, NOA VP of marketing and corporate affairs <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/personnelview.php?personnelid=1267">Perrin Kaplan</a> has sounded what is the final death knell for the Nintendo GameCube.<br />
<br />
<div style="overflow: hidden;"><div class="quote_sourced"><span class="source">Perrin Kaplan</span>Are we producing any more GameCubes? No. But do we have the inventory there for people to still purchase? Yes.</div></div><br />
Kaplan also said that the GameCube, despite no longer being manufactured, is "a great starter system" due to its low cost of entry and selection of inexpensive titles.
