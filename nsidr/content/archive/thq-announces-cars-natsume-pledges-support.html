Two more large publishers have committed to developing Revolution software, according to IGN.com.  These include <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/693/693218p1.html">THQ</a> and <a href="http://revolution.ign.com/articles/693/693225p1.html">Natsume</a>.<br><br> 

THQ will bring a version of the Disney/Pixar licensed "Cars" to all next-generation platforms including Revolution.  The title is expected to release in the "launch window" of the Revolution platform later this year (the other platform versions are expected in June alongside the release of the movie).  The company has been an avid supporter of Nintendo over the years. THQ is known for its licensed software from Nickelodeon, Disney/Pixar, World Wrestling Entertainment, Scooby-Doo and original properties such as Full Spectrum Warrior and MX Unleashed.<br><br>

Natsume has also extensively supported Nintendo platforms since they share similar demographics.  The company is best known for its Harvest Moon farm/life simulations.  One game is currently in development at the company and is expected to be shown behind closed doors at the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo in May.<br><br>

These <a href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/a-third-party-revolution">latest announcements</a> bring the total number of developers and publishers working on Revolution content to 29.
