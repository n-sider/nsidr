Meta-reporting on a NYT interview, Next Generation has Sony Computer Entertainment of America spokesman Dave Karraker with <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4646&Itemid=2">some words</a> about Wii's successful launch.<br />
<br />
"Wii could be considered an impulse buy more than anything else," Karraker told the NYT.  Claiming that Sony is selling out of weekly 100k PlayStation 3 shipments to the U.S., Karraker added, "The frenzy we saw at the holidays has subsided a bit."<br />
<br />
Anecdotally, it seems that Wii is still hard to find in stores while PlayStation 3 has been reasonably available for at least a few weeks.  Nintendo, for its part, is claiming its U.S. shipments are equal to Sony's and denounces reports of shortages due to lower shipments as "absolutely inaccurate".
