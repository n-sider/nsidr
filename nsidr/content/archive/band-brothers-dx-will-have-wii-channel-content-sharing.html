Via NeoGAF's Jonnyram comes a few more details on upcoming likely cult hit <i>Daigasso! Band Brothers DX</i>.<br />
<br />
The game's predecessor, <i>Daigasso! Band Brothers</i>, featured modes where players could create their own songs for the game, which they could share either over local wireless or unholy combinations of unlicensed hardware and the Internet.  DX will do one better, though: now players will be able to upload their tunes to a server for others to download.<br />
<br />
Additionally, something spotted in the original sales flyer has been brought a little more to light: the Wii support shown is in the form of a "Speaker Channel" that can be snagged from the (Japanese) Wii Shop Channel&#8212;price unspecified, but hopefully free. The channel will pipe audio from the game through the Wii to the TV.<br />
