Nintendo reaffirmed at the Penny Arcade Expo that <i>Metroid Prime: Hunters</i> would not release until 2006, according to 1Up.com.  This postponement brings good news however.  Although it was not previously compatible with the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service, this delay will now allow the company to incorporate the Wi-Fi functionality into the game.  So cheers to this, and we hope to bust a cap in ya'll in by 2006.
