The reviews have been rolling in for Sega and High Voltage's <i>Tournament of Legends</i>, which you may have formerly known as <i>Gladiator A.D.</i>  If you've read many of them, you probably already know the one key thing I'm going to tell you today about my experience with this game: its motion controls don't really feel like they're working well at all.<br />
<br />
I popped in the review copy Sega sent me a few days back to see what it was about.  My background is certainly not in fighters with complicated combos, so finding out that <i>Tournament</i> stuck to simple moves was a plus in my book.  Pulling off those moves became much like pulling teeth, though.  Even after finally getting a handle on what hand-swing did what combined with which button from the thin manual and short tutorial, it just didn't feel quick or accurate at all.  I get the impression it's just plain asking too much from the Remote and Nunchuk&mdash;the same feeling I first got with <i>Wii Sports</i>' boxing game way back in 2006.<br />

Everything works markedly better when you plug in a Classic Controller.  While I'm no genre expert, it seems a decent enough 3D fighter at this point.  I couldn't help but crack a smile at its (intentional?) over-the-top cheesiness and the core fighting mechanics seemed to work out OK.  Previously motion-controlled events like between-round health and armor regens and getting back up on your feet are now mapped to stick motions, just like the awkward mid-match QTEs when something like a giant foot or octopus tentacle comes smashing down into the arena.  It doesn't miraculously make the game great, but eschewing the motion option helps quite a bit.<br />
<br />
All in all, I would consider giving <i>Tournament of Legends</i> a rent if I was in the mood to beat up on a few dudes, and I had Classic Controllers enough to go around.  But nothing about it really elevates it to must-have status in my books&mdash;not even its position in the not-exactly-crowded 3D fighter space on Wii, nor its $30 asking price.
