Suda 51's latest project, <i>No More Heroes</i> for the Wii, received a countdown on its <a href="http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/wii/nomoreheroes/">official website</a>. At the moment, the countdown is set for nine days, though no indication is given as to what exactly will occur when the countdown ends.<br />
<br />
Known for Gamecube's cult hit <i>Killer 7</i>, Grasshopper's newest development lets gamers take the role of Travis Touchdown, a guy who wins a Beam Katana and seeks to use the weapon to become a professional killer. After killing an assassin named Helter Skelter, a mysterious French woman named Silvia Christel, agent with the UAA, gives Travis a rank of 11. Travis, however, wants to be number one, so he must kill the 10 assassins above him.<br />
<br />
No More Heroes has an expected Japanese release this summer, with no date given for the game's release elsewhere.
