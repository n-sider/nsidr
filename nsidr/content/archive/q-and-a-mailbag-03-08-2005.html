<h3>N-Sider Mailbag</h3>

<p><b>Edition: 03-08-2005</b>

<p>Just when you least expect it (on time) I have finished another mailbag! The 

sheer awesomeness of this edition will likely blow you away, so wear goggles. Be 

sure to check out Travis's "Good Letter, Bad Letter" section at the bottom too. I 

would like to recieve more letters next week though so stop being shy and start 

sending them in. I publish nearly every letter so don't miss your big chance at 

fame. Send your criticisms, commentary, feedback, praise, or rants to <a

<h3>Bump-Mapping Zelda</h3>

<p>hey, I got a question for you, any idea if the new Zelda 2005 will have 

bump-mapping? sorry if Im bugging you, but your site said "got a question? click 

here" so I'm free of guilt.

<p>thanks,

<p><i>- Mark Hatherly</i>
</div>

<p><b>Jeffrey: </b>Yes, it will feature bump-mapping. That is kind of a given for a 

game of its kind in this day and age. Will it feature bump mapping to the degree of 

a game like <i>Halo 2</i>? I doubt it. But here's the kicker: it doesn't matter. 

Either it looks good or it doesn't. It looks pretty to me. Don't fret over 

technical crap like that.

<h3>N-Sider Newsletter?</h3>

<p>Hey have you guys ever considered starting a newsletter for the site?

<p><i>- James Smith</i>
</div>

<p><b>Jeffrey: </b>Hah, not a bad idea. We'll think about it.

<h3>Neo-Geo "Pocket" Color</h3>

<p>SNK's handheld was technically called the Neo-Geo Pocket Color. People seem to 

forget the "Pocket" part. I'd figure it'd be referred to as NGPC, but what do I 

know.

<p><b>Jeffrey:</b> I would comment on that, but I don't want to get more letters 

about it.

<h3>Revolution Realized Rediscovered</h3>
<p>ey!

<p>I'm back once again with a question.

<p>In 2001, there was an interview posted about Nintendo and Gyration. I 
was looking around online and I found this:

<p><a 

href="http://www.projectcoe.com/Nin_SpecialFeatures/rev.html">http://www.projectcoe

.com/Nin_SpecialFeatures/rev.html</a>

<p>I find this whole idea very interesting. What are your thoughts?

<p><i>-Brian W.</i>
</div>

<p><b>Jeffrey: </b>It's definitely an interesting concept. The article you point 

out (aptly named "Revolution Rediscovered") reads suspiciously like our own "<a 

href="https://www.nsidr.com/archive/revolution-realized">Revolution 

Realized</a>" piece, which was first published on IGN last July, but I won't point 

fingers. It is a concept that could really change the way we play games. Whether or 

not it is the cornerstone of Nintendo's future plans, I don't know.

<h3>Longest Letter EVER</h3>

<p>Hello N-Sider,

<p>1. Im sure you remember on several occasions Nintendo said that the Revolution 
is going to be an evolvement from the Gamecube as the N64 was from the SNES, 
and furthermore they stated that if the DS is successful it will serve as a 
hint of what the Revolution will be. Now then, the DS is the first 
handheld console to utilize a touch screen interface (for a mass produced 
games centric console) and has already proven successful, yet despite this I 
am severely inclined to agree that its touch screen has SO FAR only been 
gimmicky at best. The main reason the DS is even selling at all is due to 
its recognition as a Nintendo console. The general public does not perceive 
it as a third pillar of sorts yet rather as off shoot of the game boy 
line, it is even compatible with GBA games after all. Its been stated 
earlier that when the next iteration of the Gameboy is released Nintendo 
will undoubtedly minimize support for DS projects I mean look at sales of 
the GBA in Japan right now, they have dropped off considerably since the 
release of the DS.

<p>2. Now then my point is that I hope Nintendo has created another device as 
revolutionary as the controller stick, (as keeping with its revolution from 
SNES to N64) that all game developers and even other console manufacturers 
will deem as an essential step in the evolution of games otherwise, Im 
going to be an extremely worried Nintendo fan. This does tie in with its 
paradigm shift statement after all, as a new patented camera system just 
doesnt cut it.

<p>3. Furthermore why are they such a secretive company yet, in recent times, 
there has been very little things copied from Nintendo at all. Lets say 
Nintendo does create a new revolutionary input device for its console, 
whats going to stop the competition from merely creating new controllers 
that feature this function as standard, (dual shock anyone) then what does 
Nintendo have? I am beginning to loose faith in my favorite company, I hope 
they remember that it is the games that make the system, and where are my 
beloved instant classic games? I am a Nintendo console only gamer and I can 
proudly say I own every console ever created by Nintendo and almost every 
decent game, yet my Gamecube collection has a severe lack of mind-blowingly 
good games, for me Zelda was a let down as was Mario, I can go as far to say 
as the only games I can say I truly love in the vein that I did Ocarina of 
Time, Goldeneye and Perfect Dark is Smash Bros: Melee and Metroid Prime.
Nintendo NEEDS to get in touch with reality and start realizing what games 
sell consoles. If Nintendo is so morally against creating games such as 
Grand Theft Auto they need to atleast pursue the developers of such games to 
release these on Nintendos console also, and I mean in the same time period 
not 2 years later, they do after all have a massive cash reserve, its time 
for them to start using it wisely. Even possibly being less secretive and 
instead start hyping up their consoles.

<p>4. The Revolution better blow not just me the loyal, defensive Nintendo fan 
away but every other console manufacturer and publisher as well. It better 
have them saying Wow! How can we be so stupid and not have thought of that 
hell it better be so good the delay the next iteration of the Xbox to 
include what it did that they didnt.

<p>5. If there was a single game lacking in the Gamecubes library I would say it 
was a First Person Shooter in the vein of Goldeneye or Perfect Dark, I mean 
sure we have Timesplitters but that doesnt even come close to capturing the 
essence of a great game as my beloved rare developed N64 games did and it 
sure isnt exclusive. Halo and Halo 2 have captured much of the market from 
underneath Nintendo and call me modest but Halo is almost single handedly 
responsible for the success of the Xbox in the American Market, at least 
during its establishment phase.

<p>6. The loss of Rare was a monumental mistake in my opinion and I dont think 
any N64 owner can disagree with me, they created nearly as many games as 
Nintendo itself for the N64, and many of them with better graphics and 
gameplay. I am still trying to understand why exactly Nintendo sold them 
off, and utilized the money for, oh nothing.

<p>7. Its becoming harder and harder for me to retain my faith in the big N, and 
I fear that if they dont begin to conform to what society has deemed the 
successful recipe for creating a gaming console and begin luring developers 
to actually RELEASE these games on Nintendos console and I mean within a 
decent time frame not 2 years later, Im afraid this will be there last shot 
at making it big once more, in the games industry. As the Dreamcast has 
proved, the next generation will be too late to get it right.

<p>8. Nintendo why are you trying to revitalize the gaming market? Claming that 
the gaming market is going to collapse if the games dont change etc etc. 
When in fact there are more console buyers and gamers now then there ever 
were? Lets not try and prevent the collapse of the industry 15 years before 
it happens, but lets stick with it, and if and when the time comes, and 
games begin to stop selling, then create your revolution that will 
single-handedly revive the games industry, when it in fact needs to be 
revived!

<p>Oh dear, May never seemed so far away

<p><i>- Dely Rousos</i>

<p><b>Jeffrey: </b>Wow. Okay, that was a long  and confusing letter. I've taken the 

liberty of numbering your paragraphs off so I can effectively respond to each of 

your many opinions. 

<p>1. Nintendo has reitterated quite a few times that the revolution will not 

simply be a touchscreen and have actually implied that it would be completely 

unrelated. What they have said is that the Nintendo DS should be viewed as a model 

for the train of thought they are operating. With that said, I tend to agree that 

the DS has yet to live up to its potential. I do not own one yet, nor do I plan on 

purchasing one until there is really something innovative and fresh that entices 

me. <i>Wario Ware: Touched</i> is the most promising thus far, but I need something 

completely new, not simply a DS extension of a top selling GBA game. <i>Kirby & The 

Magical Paintbrush</i> is my most anticipated game at this point. I am a bit 

worried that Nintendo is pushing the GBA aside, but I can't say that I didn't see 

it coming. However, just because GBA hardware sales are in the decline doesn't mean 

that interest in GBA games are. Software sales are still up there. Many people are 

buying the DS instead of a GBA SP because it features a sharper screen and better 

light.

<p>2. I, for one, hope that the Revolution is far more innovative than the control 

stick. Making a compact joystick was definitely a great step forward when entering 

the realm of 3D games, but that didn't stop the PlayStation from doubling the sales 

of the Nintendo 64. Within a few years Sony released a controller that featured 

control sticks and went about its way. For the revolution to really help Nintendo 

it will have to be something difficult to replicate on a console not designed for 

it. The big test for the Revolution will be if it is far more fun to play games on 

it than a standard controller. The DS offers many fun alternatives, but the 

touchscreen has yet to prove itself any more fun than standard controls. I'd much 

rather play a game with the controls of <i>Metroid Prime</i> than <i>Metroid Prime: 

Hunters</i>. It's in this area where Nintendo's largest challenge will arise. 

<p>3. I agree that there has been a lack of mind-blowing games for the GameCube, 

but I'd say the same for all three major consoles. Halo was nothing new, just the 

best we have this generation. And yes, Nintendo is too secretive and doesn't have 

to worry about being copied as much as it did when it was on top back in the SNES 

days. The company has been getting better over the years, so I really don't see a 

<i>huge</i> issue over that. The largest problem with the GameCube is that it has 

had no system-selling games. It has had several great games (I love <i>Wind Waker</i>), 

but no one game that appeals to the masses like <i>Goldeneye 007</i>, <i>Grand 

Theft Auto</i>, and <i>Halo</i> did. It's a system without a face. <i>Super Smash 

Bros. Melee</i> is the closest thing it has to a system-seller. <i>Resident Evil 

4</i> has all the ingredients of a system selling game, but its a bit late for it 

to really make a difference. Had <i>Resident Evil 4</i> been a launch title, we 

might not be having this conversation. Then again, I could be wrong.

<p>4. Umm, sure. I agree. (I guess)

<p>5. <i>Perfect Dark</i> and <i>Goldeneye</i> are definitely two highlights of the 

Nintendo 64 (<i>Goldeneye</i> being the brighter light, saleswise). I definitely 

agree that the GameCube has had no comparable First Person Shooters. From a 

customization standpoint alone, <i>Perfect Dark</i> is still the best multiplayer 

game out there. The Halo series is the only franchise this generation that rivals 

their success. Sadly, its only available on the Xbox. Definitely a lost opportunity for Nintendo.

<p>6. The sale of Rareware was a sound financial decision and I doubt any of you 

could show me anything relevent that would change my mind. Yes, during the Nintendo 

64 era Rare was the creator of many top notch and original IPs (Intellectual 

Properties) and several multi-million selling games. This is not the Nintendo 64 

generation. Rare has released two console games this generation: <i>Star Fox 

Adventures</i> (GCN) and <i>Grabbed by the Ghoulies</i> (XBX). Both of those titles 

were terrible and neither helped sell GameCubes or Xboxes. Say all you want about 

the mythical <i>Perfect Dark 0</i> or Rare's contributions to the Xbox 2, when it 

comes down to it Nintendo was wise to take the $250 million.

<p>7. While I don't believe that completely conforming to the industry is the right 

answer, I agree that Nintendo needs a healthy launch line-up for the Revolution 

that appeals to all clads of gamers. Even the ones who play <i>Halo</i> or 

<i>GTA</i> all day.

<p>8. I do think that Nintendo may be jumping the gun with the Revolution. Games 

have not yet reached the level of photorealism that will make it difficult for 

consumers to see much of a difference. I think that by the end of the next 

generation of consoles (about five years from now) we will be very close to that 

graphical thresh hold. With that in mind, if Nintendo wants consumers to give this 

"revolution" a chance, Nintendo's next system is going to have to be at equal 

grounds with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 2 when it comes to overall processing 

power. If gamers have to choose between having pretty graphics and a new control 

device they will choose pretty graphics. If Nintendo is wise (and I pray they are) 

it will give gamers the best of both worlds. Then, with the graphical playing-field leveled, the Revolution 'difference' will be seen as a true advantage - not just an alternative.

<p>Holy crap. This is, by far, the longest response I have ever written. Let's not 

make a habit of writing letters this long. It takes actual effort for me to respond 

and no one likes that.

<h3>Good Letter, Bad Letter</h3>

<p><font size=2><i>[Warning: The two letters you are about to read were fabricated 

solely from the twisted mind of Travis Woodside.]</i></font>

<h4>GOOD LETTER</h4>

<p>Dear sirs,</b>
<p>I've been thinking long about the inevitable next installment in the Super Mario 

franchise. Initially I was thinking, despite Nintendo's comments, that the plumber 

would return in a title more akin to that of <i>Super Mario 64</i>, thus 

eliminating the water pack and exclusively tropical environment.  However, as many 

evenings have since passed I see the release of such a title for the GameCube as 

highly unlikely. Tell me, do you good sirs feel the next Mario title will launch 

with the Nintendo Revolution? If so, what sort of new gameplay features do you 

hypothesize? You fellows are so fascinating that I simply must know your 

speculation.

<p>Respectfully,
<p><i>- Frederick Billington of the North Haven</i>

<h4>BAD LETTER</h4>

<p>Yo so mario suxs and all so i be thinkin it time for ninten to make a halo game 

werd me?  they can even make it the same to!  you just need matter chef an sum 

boms.  foo just tak rat and clack and put in the chef and bowser and your set!  

factly it for right!
 
<p>you guys need to make more games to, werd me?  i havet seen a game since perfect 

dark.  now thats what sells!!!!!!

<p><i>- fr3ddIE w000!!1!</i>
</div>

<p><b>Travis: </b>Mr. Billington, I have also been thinking about the next Mario 

title.  Though I don't wish to be purposefully vague it is true that no one knows 

what the next one will introduce in terms of gameplay advancements.  However, I 

think we can all be sure a sequel will take full advantage of whatever new 

technology the Revolution has in store.  And yes, I do believe that we won't see a 

new Mario title until the Revolution's launch.

<p>Now I hope you've all learned something from seeing Frederick at his best and 

worst. If not then I hope it was at least humorous. Now, to get on to more pressing 

matters. Feel free to send Jeff quality letters with an aside to how incredibly 

handsome and debonaire I am.
